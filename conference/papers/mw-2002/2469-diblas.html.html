      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>MiLE (Milano &#150; Lugano Evaluation Method) is an 

        innovative method for evaluating the quality and usability of hypermedia 

        applications. This paper focuses upon the specific &#147;module&#148; 

        of MiLE concerning cultural heritage applications, synthesizing the results 

        of research carried on by a group of seven museum experts of Bologna (Italy), 

        with the joint coordination of IBC (Institute for the Cultural Heritage 

        of the Emilia Romagna Region) and Politecnico di Milano. The &#147;Bologna 

        group&#148; is composed of different professional figures working in the 

        museum domain: museum curators of artistic, archaeological and historical 

        heritage; museum communication experts; Web sites of cultural institutions&#146; 

        communication experts.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>After illustrating the general features of MiLE and 

        the specific features for Cultural Heritage, we will briefly show a few 

        of the results which are to be published in the &#147;Bologna Report&#148;.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Keywords: usability, inspection method, cultural heritage, 

        users&#146; scenarios</p>

      <h1>1. MiLE in a nutshell</h1>

      <p>MiLE is based upon a combination of Inspection (i.e. an expert evaluator, 

        systematically exploring the application) and Empirical Testing (i.e. 

        a panel of end users actually using the application, under the guidance 

        and the observation of usability experts). If this combination of the 

        two methods is not new (several usability methods propose, in fact, a 

        similar combination), the innovation of MiLE comes from the set of guidelines 

        being used for making both inspection and empirical testing more effective 

        and reliable. In extreme synthesis, we introduce two specifics (heuristic 

        concepts):</p>

      <p><i>Abstract Tasks,</i> ATs in short, used for inspection. They are a 

        list of generic actions (generic in that they can be applied to a wide 

        range of applications) capable of leading the inspector through the maze 

        of the different parts and levels an application is made of, as the Ariadne&#146;s 

        thread. MiLE, in fact, provides inspectors with some guidelines that draw 

        their attention to the most relevant features of the application.</p>

      <p><i>Concrete Tasks</i>, CTs in short. They are a list of specific actions 

        (specific in that they are defined for a single application) which users 

        are required to perform while exploring the application for the empirical 

        testing.</p>

      <p>Inspection is the focus of this paper, and we will not further explore 

        the issues concerning empirical testing. One contribution of MiLE is the 

        emphasis on the need for separating different levels of analysis: technology, 

        navigation, content, illocutionary force, graphic, etc.  For each level 

        a library of Abstract Tasks has to be prepared, when building the method, 

        in order to support the inspection. The Abstract Tasks are nothing but 

        the marrow of each level&#146;s experts&#146; knowledge. For some levels 

        (e.g. graphic or navigation), the abstract tasks can be generally independent 

        from the specific application domain; for other levels (e.g. content) 

        we have different tasks according to the application domain (i.e., specific 

        tasks for the cultural heritage domain, for the e-commerce domain, and 

        so on).</p>

      <p>The inspector has to understand the client&#146;s communicative goals, 

        combine them with the intended users&#146; probable requirements, and 

        then select the appropriate set of tasks to perform. If, for example, 

        we have to evaluate a museum&#146;s site that is specifically meant to 

        attract visitors to the real museum, we &#150; as inspectors &#150;concentrate 

        on all those tasks that at the content level involve the practical services 

        parts of the site (opening hours, &#147;buy a Ticket&#148;, etc.).</p>

      <p>When performing inspection, the inspector has to check a list of attributes 

        concerning the different facets of usability/quality (e.g. richness, completeness, 

        etc.). For each attribute (in relation to a specific AT), a score must 

        be given. After the scoring phase is over, the set of collected scores 

        is analyzed through &#147;weights&#148; which define the relevance of 

        each attribute for a specific goal (or, technically speaking, for a &#147;user 

        scenario&#148;).</p>

      <p>Weighting allows us a clean separation between the &#147;scoring phase&#148; 

        (using the application, performing the tasks, and examining them) from 

        the &#147;evaluation phase&#148; in a strict sense, where different possible 

        usages are considered. Let us introduce a simple example: assume that 

        a navigation feature (e.g. using indexes) is not very powerful, but very 

        easy to learn. What should the evaluation be? With MiLE the inspector 

        can provide a score (e.g. 9/10 for &#147;predictability&#148; and 2/10 

        for &#147;powerfulness&#148;) for the navigation. Later, figuring out 

        two different user scenarios (e.g. casual users and professional users), 

        the evaluator (possibly different from the inspector), can assign two 

        different pairs of weights to the attributes &#147;predictability&#148; 

        and &#147;powerfulness&#148;. The weights, for example could be &lt;0.8 

        (predictability), 0.2 (powerfulness)&gt;, for casual users, or &lt;0.1 

        (predictability), 0.9 (powerfulness)&gt; for professional users. The weighted 

        score for the navigation feature is very different of course (7.6 for 

        casual users and 2.7 respectively), but it reflects the different users&#146; 

        scenarios. The inspector could therefore conclude that the application 

        (at least for this feature) is well suited for casual users, while it 

        is somehow ineffective for professional users. Trying different  weighting 

        systems allows the evaluator to test different user scenarios using the 

        same set of scores derived from the inspection.</p>

      <p>In short, an inspection with MiLE requires the following steps:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> selection of the relevant portion 

          of the application (based upon considerations that we can&#146;t investigate 

          here);</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> selection of the Abstract Tasks 

          that are relevant for the intended user scenarios;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> execution of the Abstract Tasks, 

          providing scores for each attribute;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">for each user scenario</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">weighting of the attributes and 

          of the tasks chosen (a certain task can be more relevant than another);</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">production of quantitative evaluation 

          measures (applying weights to scores)</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p>The reliability of the method has proved to be very high. Execution of 

        the Abstract Tasks (at navigation and content level) allows producing 

        more reliable evaluation results and helps spot unexpected usability problems 

        (inconsistencies, lack of clarity, etc.). Even &#147;at-first-sight agreeable&#148; 

        sites, when put to the test through a systematic inspection &#147;à la 

        MiLE&#148;, may reveal weaknesses and defects.</p>

      <p>Inspection already provides valuable evaluations; in some cases, however, 

        panels of users may be required for double checking. When empirical testing 

        is required, users are given a list of concrete tasks, i.e. a list of 

        specific actions that they are asked to perform. Concrete tasks definition 

        (different for each case) is based upon the results of the inspection, 

        which has identified portions of the application, tasks and attributes 

        that need special attention. &#147;Real users&#148; can fine-tune the 

        inspector&#146;s observations, confirming them (very often), or dissenting 

        from them (seldom) or spotting additional problems. We now discuss the 

        above outlined approach applied to cultural heritage applications.</p>

      <h1>2. Guidelines for Evaluating Cultural Heritage Applications</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Some of the features (such as navigation or layout) 

        of an application can be examined largely independently from a specific 

        application domain; other features, such as content or functions offered 

        to the users, require a different evaluation schema for each application 

        domain. In order to explore functions and contents for museum Web sites 

        (a specific sub-domain, within the larger domain of cultural heritage 

        applications), a specific panel of &#147;experts&#148; (the so-called 

        &#147;Bologna group&#148;) has been created, with a partnership between 

        Politecnico di Milano and &#147;Istituto Beni Culturali&#148;, a regional 

        organization supervising cultural heritage activities in a large region, 

        Emilia Romagna, with headquarters in Bologna. The group is composed of 

        museum curators (both of archaeology, modern and contemporary art museums 

        and galleries), museum communication experts, and researchers of new technologies 

        for cultural heritage.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The first step of the Bologna group was to identify 

        the main pieces of a generic Museum Web site. In order to avoid the danger 

        of &#147;wish listing&#148; the sum of what everybody could foresee as 

        the &#147;ideal Web site&#148;, we took an empirical standing: we selected 

        a large number of sites and considered them to be the &#147;universe of 

        discourse&#148;. The resulting model (shown also in the appendix) is therefore 

        a synthesis of contents and features found in those sites. At this stage 

        of the research, we have listed more than a hundred &#147;elementary&#148; 

        constituents, organized into three main groups:</p>

      <p> <span class="BlockQuote">A. site presentation: general information about 

        the Web site;</span></p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">B. museum presentation: contents and functions referring 

        to a &#147;physical museum&#148; (like &#147;arrows&#148; pointing to 

        the real world);</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">C. the virtual museum: contents and functions exploiting 

        the communicative strength of the medium.</p>

      <p class="normal">A further analysis has allowed us to detect &#147;high 

        level&#148; constituents such as, <i>collections, services, promotion,</i> 

        which gather the elementary constituents<i> </i>(a full account of all 

        the pieces of the model can be found as an Appendix to this paper).</p>

      <p>The next job has been to define a set of users&#146; scenarios as a way 

        to build a library of suitable ATs. A user scenario, in this context, 

        is a pair &lt;user profile, operation (that users may wish to perform)&gt;. 

        In simple words, we tried to identify a number of user profiles (culture, 

        expertise, interests, etc.) and for each of them we tried to provide a 

        set of meaningful answers to this simple question: &#147;What might a 

        user (with this profile) want to do with the application?&#148; </p>

      <p>Therefore the tasks are coupled to user profiles, in the sense that a 

        given task may be interesting for a given profile, and/or meaningless 

        (or irrelevant) for a different profile. When the inspectors perform an 

        inspection, they will learn from their customers who the intended users 

        of the application are and will concentrate on those tasks likely to be 

        performed by these customers. In any case the Inspectors will be free 

        to create new tasks that fit better the communicative goals of the application, 

        as long as they follow the guidelines of the method and its &#147;philosophy&#148;.</p>

      <p>Overall we have classified ATs according to two different dimensions: 

        &#147;scope&#148; and &#147;concern&#148;. Possible values for scope are 

        the following: Narrow (a specific item is interesting), Complex (several 

        items are interesting), and General (a generic overview). Possible values 

        for concern are Practical Info (the user wants to gather useful information), 

        Operational (the user wants to do something) and Cognitive (the user wishes 

        to learn something).</p>

      <p>The following table shows some examples of AT, classified accordingly:</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="diblasfig1.gif" width="450" height="115"><br>

        <span class="MsoCaption">Table 1: Some examples of AT</span></p>

      <p>Regarding the users, we took into consideration a number of variables, 

        such as age, expertise, professional interest (e.g. school students, fine 

        arts students, fine arts experts, tourists, etc.) Each relevant user profile 

        is based upon a number of these variables.</p>

      <p>On-going research work consists of identifying the largest possible number 

        of ATs. More than fifty ATs have been identified so far (while 49 ATs 

        where identified for navigation, in another research), and more than double 

        that number will be the likely result.</p>

      <p>Regarding the list of attributes to be scored during the inspection, 

        we started with the idea that they would be different for each AT. At 

        the moment, however, we have developed the following list which seems 

        to be applicable (with minor problems only) virtually to any AT:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Efficiency: the action can be 

          performed successfully and quickly</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Authority: the author is competent 

          in relation to the subject</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Currency: the time scope of the 

          content&#146;s validity is clearly stated. The info is updated.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Consistency: similar pieces of 

          information are dealt with in similar fashions</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Structure effectiveness: the 

          organization of the content pieces is not disorienting</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Accessibility: the information 

          is easily and intuitively accessible</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Completeness: the user can find 

          all the information required</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Richness: the information required 

          is rich (many examples, data&#133;)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Clarity: the information is easy 

          to understand</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Conciseness: the basic pieces 

          of information are given; texts are not too long and redundant</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Multimediality: different media 

          are used to convey the information</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Multilinguisticity: the information 

          is given in more than one language</span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>3. Some Examples</h1>

      <p>In this section we will introduce a few examples of inspection to help 

        the reader grasp how our method works. The examples are very simple, and 

        are taken from actual Web sites. We hope that in the period between the 

        writing of this paper and the reading of it by a user, the Web sites will 

        not be modified, so that the readers may try directly to &#147;inspect&#148; 

        them.   (The impossibility of &#147;freezing&#148; Web sites, in practice, 

        makes it difficult to develop examples of inspection that could maintain 

        their validity over a long span of time.)</p>

      <h2>Example 1 (practical Info AT)</h2>

      <p><b>find the events/exhibitions/lectures occurring on a specific date 

        in a real museum</b><b></b></p>

      <p>The user&#146;s scenario for this task is that of well-educated French-speaking 

        tourists (who can speak English too), first-time visitors to the site, 

        who know that on March 9<sup>th</sup> (Saturday), 2002, they will be in 

        the town where the real museum is actually located. Therefore they would 

        like to know what special exhibitions or activities of any kind (lectures, 

        guided tours, concerts) will take place in that day.</p>

      <p>We performed this task on many different Web sites, and we  describe 

        here our findings for the Louvre site (<a href="../http://www.louvre.fr/" target="_blank">www.louvre.fr</a>) 

        and the Royal Ontario Museum site (<a

href="../http://www.rom.on.ca/" target="_blank">www.rom.on.ca</a>), on the basis 

        of an inspection that took place on February 13<sup>th</sup>, 2002. The 

        focus of our attention is the section named &#147;information about museum 

        activities and events&#148; in our schema (see the Appendix for the details).</p>

      <p>The relevant attributes that we use for this brief example are the following:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>(A1) currency of the information; </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>(A2) quality of the organization of the information, 

        since users are looking for operational support;</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>(A3) multilinguisticity, fundamental for an international 

        audience;</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>(A4) richness of the information provided, very important 

        in order to make understandable the potential interest of the events.</p>

      <p class=MsoFooter><span class="MsoBodyText">The Louvre Web site offers 

        a choice among four languages (French, English, Spanish, Japanese). In 

        the home page we find (on the left menu) three relevant links: &#147;Expositions&#148;, 

        &#147;Auditorium&#148; (a rather &#147;obscure&#148; name, for it refers 

        to a specific place in the real museum, but its actual meaning can be 

        understood only by second-time users) and &#147;Visites &#150; conférences 

        et ateliers&#148;.</span></p>

      <p class=MsoFooter><span class="MsoBodyText">If we click on &#147;Expositions&#148;, 

        we get a list of the exhibitions currently available or coming soon; &#147;temporal 

        windows&#148; allow users to easily select the exhibition fitting their 

        needs.</span></p>

      <p class=MsoFooter><span class="MsoBodyText">If we click on &#147;Auditorium&#148;, 

        we find a wide choice of activities: &quot;agenda&quot;, &quot;concerts&quot;, 

        &quot;</span><span class="MsoBodyText">cinéma muet en concert&quot;, &quot;&nbsp;classique 

        en images&quot;, &quot;colloques&quot;, &quot;conférences&quot;, &quot;les 

        enfants au Louvre&quot;,&quot;films&quot;,&quot;lectures&quot;, &quot;midis 

        du Louvre&quot; (conferences and activities taking place at midday), &quot;musée-musées&quot;,&quot;musique 

        filmée&quot;, &quot;l&#146;oeuvre en direct&quot;. </span></p>

      <p class=MsoFooter><span class="MsoBodyText">From a graphic point of view, 

        the first element of the list (&#147;agenda&#148;) looks exactly the same 

        as all the others; only after a short exploration do the visitors discover 

        that under the voice &#147;agenda&#148; they can find, arranged in chronological 

        order, all the pieces of information that are available under the other 

        twelve voices.</span></p>

      <p class=MsoFooter><span class="MsoBodyText">If eventually we click on &#147;Visites 

        &#150; conférences et ateliers&#148; we have to choose whether we&#146;re 

        interested in &#147;visites-conferences&#148; or &#147;ateliers&#148; 

        and whether we&#146;re adults or children. The &#147;visites-conferences&#148; 

        are furtherly divided into these categories: &quot;visite découverte&quot;, 

        &quot;visite d&#146;une collection&quot;, &quot;&nbsp;visites thématiques&quot;, 

        &quot;thèmes du lundi soir&quot;,&quot;monographies d&#146;artistes&quot;, 

        &quot;une heure-une &#156;uvre&quot;, &quot;visite d&#146;exposition temporaire&quot;,&quot;promenades 

        architecturales&quot;. Clicking on &#147;promenades architecturales&#148; 

        we discover that on March 9<sup>th</sup> (Saturday) there is a special 

        guided tour called &#147;Le Louvre, l'oeuvre et le musée&#148;, of which 

        we find no mention in the agenda. Therefore, even once one has found out 

        the &#147;collective&#148; character of the agenda-page, a brief exploration 

        of other related links makes it clear beyond doubt that the agenda-page 

        is not exhaustive as regards all the special events taking place at the 

        Louvre on a specific date.<b> </b>On the whole, we can say that although 

        the information is well updated and exhaustive once found, too many paths 

        have to be trodden in order to get to the point.</span></p>

      <p class=MsoFooter><span class="MsoBodyText">The Royal Ontario Museum shows 

        a better solution: in the home page we find &#147;what&#146;s on calendar&#148;, 

        a link that leads us to a page showing a big calendar of the current month, 

        divided into cells; all the events taking place on a specific day are 

        listed in the day&#146;s cell and are all linkable to a description&#146;s 

        page. Previous or next months (or even years) are shown on demand by clicking 

        on the arrows on the top of the page. The task can be performed quickly 

        and easily. Note that if our French-speaking tourist doesn&#146;t speak 

        English at all and decides to enter the French version of the site, he 

        has to choose the item &#147;expositions&#148;, leading to a much less 

        appealing list of the present, future and past exhibitions very similar 

        to the Louvre&#146;s. For the scoring we have considered the English version.</span></p>

      <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span class="MsoBodyText">The table below synthesizes 

        our scoring and evaluation.</span></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="diblas.fig2.gif" width="450" height="121"><br>

        Table 2: The scores and the evaluation for &#147;a visit in a given day&#148;</p>

      <p class=MsoFooter><span class="MsoBodyText">We do not ask the reader to 

        agree with our scores (we may be poor inspectors) but to appreciate the 

        method on a number of issues:</span></p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">a) We are evaluating a specific task and not expressing 

        a global evaluation; in addition, we are scoring each single attribute. 

        This level of detail introduces two advantages: precision of the feedback 

        to application designers and possibility of pinpointing the causes for 

        possible discrepancies among different inspectors.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">b) Through weights we can take into account the specific 

        objectives for the (portion of the) application. In the example above, 

        we gave great relevance to attributes A2 and A1, and minor relevance to 

        A3 and A4.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">c) Global concise evaluation can be obtained trough 

        combining the evaluation for each attribute (as in the above table), and/or 

        combining the evaluation for the different ATs (again using weights in 

        order to attribute different relevance to each AT).</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">d) Different systems of weights can be used in order 

        to take into account different user profiles.</p>

      <h2>Example 2 (Cognitive AT)</h2>

      <p><b>find all the works of an artist shown in the site</b></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">This task might be performed by a high-school student 

        looking for some information about an artist he&#146;s currently studying 

        at school; let&#146;s say Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. He finds out that 

        some of Tiepolo&#146;s works are kept by the Met Museum <a href="../http://www.metmuseum.org/" target="_blank">(www.metmuseum.org</a>) 

        and by the Hermitage Museum (<a href="../http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/" target="_blank">www.hermitagemuseum.org</a>).</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The relevant attributes that we will use for this 

        brief example are the following:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span class="BlockQuote">(A1) effectiveness of the information; 

        </span></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span class="BlockQuote">(A2) completeness of the information;</span></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span class="BlockQuote">(A3) richness of the information;</span></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span class="BlockQuote">(A4) navigation organization.</span></p>

      <p>Using The Metropolitan Museum&#146;s Website, we have two choices: to 

        use the search engine, or to navigate the site. Writing the name &#147;Tiepolo&#148; 

        in the search window of the home page, we get a list of more than 200 

        records, many of which refer to the shop on-line. If we leave aside this 

        too-long list and enter the section &#147;collections&#148;, we can use 

        the tool &#147;search the collection&#148;, inserting again the name &#147;Tiepolo&#148; 

        (or the full name &#147;Giovanni Battista Tiepolo&#148;, in order to avoid 

        the mixing between Giovanni Battista&#146;s and Giovanni Domenico&#146;s 

        works). This more precise searching tool gives as a result the list of 

        the 23 Giovanni Battista Tiepolo&#146;s works of art shown in the Web 

        site. For each of the works, we have also the basic data, a description 

        and the possibility of zooming the image.</p>

      <p>If we decide to ignore the search and to find what we&#146;re looking 

        for by navigating the site, then we have to reach the sub-section &#147;European 

        paintings&#148; of the section &#147;the collection&#148;; here we find 

        a brief introduction in which there&#146;s a mention of our author and 

        a link. Following the link we are shown a single work of Tiepolo (&#147;Allegory 

        of the planets and continents&#148;), but having entered the guided tour 

        of the department&#146;s highlights, if we click on the &#147;next&#148; 

        or &#147;previous&#148; buttons, then we find other artists&#146; works 

        of art but no more Tiepolos. In order to perform our task, we have either 

        to check one by one the 2275 items preserved by the department (clicking 

        on &#147;entire department&#148;) or, if we don&#146;t want to spend too 

        many hours in front of the video, to turn again to the search tool.</p>

      <p>The Hermitage Web site offers a similar functionality, for we have a 

        search tool right in the home page. Inserting the name &#147;Tiepolo&#148;, 

        we are given a list of 10 works of art (each of them with the zoom); one 

        of them (not the first nor the last, therefore it takes a careful reading 

        to notice it) is in fact not by Giovanni Battista but by Giovanni Domenico 

        Tiepolo; in any case, we are not allowed to search by the full name (Giovanni 

        Battista Tiepolo). There isn&#146;t a description of the works.</p>

      <p>If instead we navigate the site, we can choose either &#147;collection 

        highlights&#148; or &#147;digital collection&#148;. In the former case, 

        we have further to select the option &#147;western European art&#148; 

        and eventually &#147;painting&#148;; after all this path we are given 

        an introduction to Western European painting with some little icons on 

        the right side, one of them representing the painting by Tiepolo: &#147;Maecenas 

        Presenting the Liberal Arts to Emperor Augustus&#148;. A link leads to 

        a bigger image and a description. As an alternative, we can decide to 

        browse the &#147;digital collection&#148; by type of art work (&#147;paintings 

        prints and drawings&#148;) and artist, getting nine results (corresponding 

        in this case to the nine works by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo).</p>

      <p>On the whole, we can say that both sites permit reaching the wished information 

        only by using the search engines: this can be considered a sign of poor 

        organization of the information.</p>

      <p>For the Metropolitan, the collection&#146;s search engine must be used 

        and not the &#147;main&#148; search; otherwise the user may get completely 

        lost! The Hermitage search engine doesn&#146;t distinguish between the 

        works of Giovanni Battista and Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo. The Metropolitan 

        Museum offers a good description of all the items, whilst the Hermitage 

        offers only one single work&#146;s description (the others are simply 

        &#147;shown&#148;).</p>

      <p>The table below synthesize our scoring and evaluation.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption align="center"><img src="diblaisfig3.gif" width="450" height="120">Table 

        3: The scores and the evaluation for &#147;all the works of a given artist&#148;</p>

      <p>We should note first, that in this case the weights do not change the 

        relative evaluation of the two sites, but rather reduce both of them, 

        given the high relevance assigned to A4. Secondly, we can see that if 

        more details about navigation are wanted, then a different level of analysis 

        should be entered: we have devised nearly 50 different tasks in order 

        to inspect navigation features precisely.</p>

      <h1>4. Conclusions and Future Work</h1>

      <p>The general distinctive features introduced by MILE can be synthesized 

        as follows:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <span class="normal">Efficient 

          combination of inspection and empirical testing</span></span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <span class="normal">Use of Abstract 

          Tasks, ATs, as guidelines for inspection</span></span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <span class="normal">Use of Attributes 

          as a way to detail scoring</span></span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <span class="normal">Use of Concrete 

          Tasks, CTs, as guidelines for empirical testing</span></span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <span class="normal">Use of weights 

          as a way to translate scores into evaluation</span></span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <span class="normal">Use of user 

          profiles in order to assign weights</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 

          </span></li>

      </ul>

      <p>The specific contribution of the Bologna group (there is also another 

        research group, coordinated by The Museum of Science and Technology of 

        Milan, examining the same issue for scientific and technical museums) 

        is described in this paper.   Our task has been the identification of 

        a general framework for defining a set of AT suitable for Art Museum Web 

        sites<span class=MsoFootnoteReference>.</span> The framework is the result 

        of an extensive analysis of several Web sites which are now the objective 

        of our trial inspection.</p>

      <p>The current work consists of identifying, through the ATs, the &#147;universe 

        of possible functions&#148; that a museum Web site should support; the 

        next step will be to pair user profile features with ATs. The goal is 

        to generate an overall schema showing what type of user is interested 

        and in what information/action. The combination of user-profile/AT is 

        what we mean by User Scenario; therefore, we could also say that we are 

        trying to build a large set of possible user scenarios for museum Web 

        sites.</p>

      <p>We aim at providing a contribution to the community of people interested 

        in museum Web sites (museum curators, designers, Web managers, etc.), 

        sharing our understanding of  what it means to evaluate quality and usability 

        of &#147;virtual artifacts&#148;.</p>

      <p>Since the amount of work to be performed is immense, and we would like 

        to generate a discussion in a large community, the authors encourage all 

        interested persons to contact them in order to enlarge the scope and the 

        validity of this research in evaluation.</p>
