        <p class=PaperTitle>E-Mail Newsletters for the Museum and its Visitors</p>

        <p class=Author>Ted Drake, San Diego Museum of Art</p>

        <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

        <p class=AbstractText>There are various methods of communication employed 

          between a museum and its visitors.  Many museums receive a large percentage 

          of their visitors from personal references.  News of an interesting 

          exhibition can spread quickly through the cafés and businesses of a 

          city.  Museums also produce brochures, rack cards, journals, invitations, 

          and many other publications to bring in new people and encourage repeat 

          visitors. While word of mouth is free and printed information can reach 

          large numbers of people, each has a weakness:  size of distribution 

          and cost.  </p>

        <p class=AbstractText>There is a new marketing medium that is cheap and 

          has large distribution potential.  It is generated instantly and gives 

          the visitor the opportunity to respond quickly and effectively.  This 

          new tool is e-mail.</p>

        <p class=AbstractText>To have a marketing platform without e-mail support 

          is like a contractor working without a nail gun.  You could still get 

          your information out, but it would be ignoring the quickest, most efficient 

          method available.</p>

        <p class=AbstractText>The San Diego Museum of Art has been using e-mail 

          newsletters to create a motivated, informed, and active visitor base.  

          These weekly newsletters give information about:</p>

      </div>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><i>Exhibitions and works of art</i></span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><i>Remind readers about upcoming concerts, classes, and activities</i></span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">

          <div class=Section1><span class="AbstractText"><i>Spotlight new merchandise 

            in the store</i></span></div>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><i>Create a fluid relationship between the viewer and <a>visitor</a> 

            </i></span></li>

      </ul>

      <div class=Section1> 

        <p class=AbstractText>This presentation will discuss the steps necessary 

          to set up an effective e-mail marketing plan for museums, with the emphasis 

          on newsletters. To maintain a positive impression, you must understand 

          the line between ethical and non-ethical use of e-mail.  Most museums 

          use direct mail to send unsolicited information to prospective members&#146; 

          homes.  While this is tolerated in the physical world, it is not accepted 

          in the virtual world.  It could leave your museum open to criticism, 

          create problems with your Internet service provider, and even lead to 

          unwanted legal troubles.  The line between permission based mailing 

          and &#147;spam&#148; must be understood before an e-mail marketing plan 

          is begun.  </p>

        <p class=AbstractText>The tone and style of an e-mail campaign should 

          match the other publications of the museum.  Perhaps the same team that 

          prepares the information for a printed newsletter will prepare the electronic 

          newsletter. Once the message has been produced, it has to be distributed 

          to the recipients.  Production and distribution could be achieved with 

          Microsoft <i>Outlook</i> and Qualcomm&#146;s <i>Eudora</i>, but these 

          programs do not offer the flexibility, tracking, and efficiency of programs 

          designed for mass mailings.    Stone Analytic&#146;s <i>Key Factor </i>and 

          mailing list options will be discussed as well.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>In the fall of 2000, the San Diego Museum of Art 

          launched <i>Muse News</i>, an e-mail newsletter.  The goals were simple: 

          provide a weekly newsletter to the visitors of the museum; raise participation 

          levels for events, exhibitions, and classes; educate the  public; and 

          do all this at very low cost.   </p>

        <p class=MsoCaption><img src="drake-fig1.jpg" width="400" height="516"><br>

          Figure1: Example of html formatted Muse-News Newsletter</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>The San Diego Museum of Art also uses a quarterly 

          newsletter, rack cards, and various brochures that are mailed to members 

          and supporters to announce activities, classes, and exhibitions.  The 

          costs for producing and mailing them are enormous.  While the Muse News 

          will not replace these publications, e-mail supplements their messages 

          with  minimal costs and maximum results.</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>Muse News is a short, concise newsletter.  It encourages 

          viewers to visit the Web site for more information and to ultimately 

          make the trip to the Museum to enjoy the offerings.   To maintain a 

          consistent voice for the Museum&#146;s publications, it is written and 

          edited by the marketing department&#146;s public relations officer.  

          Our goal is to make it effortless to read, yet entertaining and educational.  

          Our museum has used surveys to find out what the readers are interested 

          in seeing.  Consistently they have asked for short articles about works 

          of art, history, styles, and artists.  </p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>There is an interest in more than the basic selling 

          points of an exhibition.  The newsletter is a wonderful tool for educating 

          visitors.  A regular column about the collection of the  museum can 

          bring repeat visitors to the galleries.  Developing content for the 

          newsletter is a job for all departments of the museum.  Regular deadlines 

          help maintain the flow of information to the editor.  The readers  maintain 

          their interest longer if given a wide variety of stories, information 

          about what is important in the Museum, and time-sensitive articles to 

          encourage regular visits.  </p>

        <p class=MsoCaption><img src="drake-fig2.jpg" width="400" height="480"><br>

          Figure 2: The home page of our Museum&#146;s Web site</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>Muse News was designed to mimic the style of the 

          Museum&#146;s Web site visually and stylistically. We have experimented 

          with various programs to format and broadcast the e-mails and have settled 

          on a powerful combination of programs, Dreamweaver and KeyFactor, to 

          make the newsletters handsome and the list easy to maintain.  A newsletter 

          can be produced with a basic e-mail program; however, formatting, speed 

          of distribution, and subscriber maintenance will not be as efficient.  

        </p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>To be effective, a newsletter has to have consistent 

          timing.  We have chosen a weekly format to emphasize our activities 

          and remind visitors what is available.  The weekly format allows short 

          newsletters with current information.  A monthly newsletter may be more 

          appropriate for museums that do not have many programs or lack the resources 

          to produce a weekly message. A list of upcoming events for the month 

          can help readers plan their visits.  Because the Museum activities are 

          generally held during the week, Muse News is sent out every Sunday morning.   

          A museum with heavy weekend activities might switch to Wednesday or 

          Thursday. We have also presented special campaigns on Wednesdays to 

          draw attention to specific events.  </p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>The Muse News is also reproduced on our Web site.  

          This encourages viewers to return to the site and gives people a chance 

          to stay informed without receiving more e-mail.  For easy navigation, 

          there is a link to the newsletter on every page of our site.  This is 

          consistently one of the top requested pages on our Web site, illustrating 

          its ability to draw repeat visitors.</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>The newsletter is sent in both html and text formats.  

          The html format allows more control over the formatting and links in 

          the newsletter.  However, some readers may have trouble viewing html 

          coding, so the plain text version is sent as well. </p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>We use Key Factor to send our newsletters.  This 

          distribution software sends thousands of e-mails quickly, tracks the 

          click-thru rates on links, gives readers the ability to subscribe and 

          unsubscribe, and collects demographic information via the subscription 

          page.  Key Factor uses a server and is accessed via a modem.  KeyFactor 

          is produced by Stone Analytics and is a very powerful program; however, 

          there are many similar programs available. We use Dreamweaver for formatting 

          the html version of the newsletter.  Dreamweaver produces a clean code, 

          causing minimal crashes and other problems on the viewers&#146; machines.  

        </p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>The e-mail newsletter is the ideal method to keep 

          your visitors informed.  It is easy to set up, welcomed by the reader, 

          inexpensive, and allows timely distribution of information.  This seminar 

          will cover the basic advantages of e-mail newsletters, the steps to 

          building and maintaining a newsletter, and the options for distributing 

          your messages.</p>

        <h1>Opt-In vs. Spam</h1>

        <p class=MsoCaption><img src="drake-fig3.jpg" width="400" height="496"><br>

          Figure 3: On-line subscription form for Muse-News</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>In the world of e-mail marketing, spam is the dark 

          cloud that hovers on the horizon.  There is a strong line between a 

          welcomed e-mail and an unsolicited (spam) e-mail.  Your museum must 

          make a decision where it will stand on the generation of new e-mail 

          recipients.   Museums already utilize purchased lists of addresses for 

          direct marketing.  Brochures and invitations to become members are sent 

          regularly to people who do not ask for them.  While this is accepted 

          in the physical mailbox, many people are offended when their computer&#146;s 

          mailbox receives such notices.  </p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>Lists of e-mail addresses can be purchased from the 

          same sources direct mailing addresses are acquired from.  Sending unsolicited 

          e-mails could create a negative reaction in readers, possible punishment 

          from your Internet service provider, and even legal ramifications.  

          Your e-mail newsletter audience should consist of Opt-In recipients.  

          These people have requested the newsletter and have the ability to stop 

          future mailings.  Permission-based e-mail develops a positive relationship 

          between the reader and the museum.</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>The quickest way to develop the mailing list is with 

          a subscription page on the museum&#146;s Web site.  The San Diego Museum 

          of Art uses a home page pop-up window that invites viewers to subscribe.  

          A cookie makes the window pop up only on the first visit to the Web 

          site.  A second form is also available under the Web site version of 

          the e-mail newsletter.  The subscription form should include a privacy 

          statement, a place for e-mail address, name, and a clear definition 

          of the newsletter they will be receiving, its frequency, and content. 

          The subscription form can also include places for subscriber&#146;s 

          name, address, phone number, and comments.  </p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>Visitors to the museum can be encouraged to sign 

          up for the newsletter by using clip boards with sign-up sheets at events 

          or in areas of the museum.  An introductory e-mail to your members can 

          be especially effective.  The following is a short example of an invitation:</p>

        <p class=BlockQuote>&#147;We have a weekly email newsletter that is designed 

          to keep you up to date on events and happenings. Please take the time 

          to sign up by sending an email to Ted Drake, San Diego Museum of Art 

          Web Master, <a

href="mailto:sdmated@pacbell.net" target="_blank"><i>sdmated@pacbell.net</i></a> or by visiting 

          our site, <a href="../http://www.sdmart.org/" target="_blank"><i>www.sdmart.org</i></a>.&quot;</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>Contact other organizations in your town to share 

          announcements about newsletters.  For instance, if your local symphony 

          has a newsletter, maybe their readers would be interested in subscribing 

          to your museum&#146;s newsletter and vice versa.</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>Other publications from the museum should also encourage 

          people to sign up for the newsletter. In the direct mail, include the 

          following information:</p>

      </div>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A description of the types of e-mail you will be sending, and the 

          frequency</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The benefits customers can expect by subscribing to the e-mail list</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">

          <div class=Section1> A Call to Action: get them to visit your site and 

            subscribe to the newsletter</div>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">

          <div class=Section1> Timing and Frequency: not too often, yet not spaced 

            out.  Four regular e-mails a month, 3-4 additional ad hoc at the most.</div>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Privacy Statement</span></li>

      </ul>

      <div class=Section1>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>You are also responsible for making it easy for the 

          subscribers to remove themselves from your mailing list.  Each e-mail 

          should have a link to an unsubscription form on your Web site or an 

          e-mail address to have it done manually.  This will help you avoid the 

          dreaded spam label.  We have an automatic unsubscription link in each 

          e-mail; we also receive the occasional e-mail requesting unsubscription.  

          Quick and courteous response maintains the positive relationship between 

          the reader and your museum.</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>Your museum&#146;s printed materials should always 

          mention the Web site address, and whenever possible, the newsletter.  

          This will also help you build the list.</p>

        <h1>Generating and Distributing the Newsletter</h1>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>Generating e-mail newsletters requires two pieces 

          of software.  One program will format and build the e-mail.  A second 

          program will send the e-mail to the recipients.  It is possible to do 

          both with Microsoft Outlook, Qualcomm&#146;s Eudora, or similar programs, 

          but they are not as flexible.</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>E-mails can be sent in two different formats, plain 

          text and html.  Plain text e-mails are the easiest to produce, can be 

          read by all types of computers, and are quick to download.  HTML formatted 

          e-mails can include images, color, tables, and scripting to catch the 

          reader&#146;s eye, maintain the look of the Museum&#146;s Web site, 

          and get better results.  However, not all e-mail users can view HTML 

          formatted e-mails.  For best results, most e-mail sending programs allow 

          both formats to be mailed simultaneously.</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>To format your e-mails, a Web site developing program 

          is used.  Any text editor can be used to hand code an HTML document.  

          We use a WYSIWYG editor for formatting our e-mail newsletter.  We are 

          currently using Dreamweaver to create the HTML version of our newsletter.  

          In the past, we have tried Net Objects Fusion, Outlook, and Microsoft 

          Word with various degrees of success.  Dreamweaver creates the cleanest 

          codes and works the best with our e-mail distribution software, Key 

          Factor.  Outlook and Microsoft Word tend to add special Microsoft tags 

          to the head of the page, and they can confuse e-mail programs.  </p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>Use tables to establish columns, colors, and headlines.  

          This will keep the file size small, add dimension to your e-mail, and 

          focus the reader&#146;s attention where it is important.  Matching your 

          e-mail newsletter to the style of your Web site will encourage browsing 

          and Brand Identity.  Do not include images unless they are necessary 

          for the newsletter.  People with slow Internet connections do not appreciate 

          having to wait for their e-mail to download.  To include an image, you 

          may want to have the e-mail refer to an image on your Web site instead 

          of including it in the mailing itself.  Use this tag to insert an image: 

        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>&lt;img src=&#148;<a

href="../../../external.gif?link=http://www.yourwebsite.org/nameofimage.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.yourwebsite.org/nameofimage.jpg</a>&#148; 

          Width=XX Height=XX Alt=&#148;description of image&#148;&gt;  </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>This will speed up downloads for programs that do not 

          accept images.  However, it will cause a problem with people who have 

          set their Outlook to hang up after downloading e-mails.  When your newsletter 

          is viewed, the program will have to re-connect to show the image.  </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>If your Web site has not already established a style 

          for body and links, you may want to use red as the link color.  Red 

          is an action color and can draw attention to the links.  Verdana and 

          Georgia are fonts that are easier to view on a screen.  Our newsletter 

          uses Verdana at &#150;1 size, black text with red links.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>HTML formatted e-mails can use advanced formatting 

          techniques, but you will limit your readers by using java scripting, 

          layers, images, and other techniques that create larger and more complex 

          files.  These scripts can often crash the reader&#146;s e-mail program. 

          Meta Tags tell the browsers and search engines how to view and find 

          web pages.  They are also part of  html-formatted e-mails.  We have 

          had compatibility problems with e-mails due to these Meta tags. Careful 

          analysis of our Meta tags and the resulting problems with readers has 

          led us to our current formatting program, Dreamweaver. We have used 

          an old Mac to test our e-mails.  This computer has been known to crash 

          at the drop of a hat, and when our newsletters no longer created any 

          conflicts, we were satisfied with the result.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Microsoft Outlook uses Word for editing the e-mails. 

          This is satisfactory for sending e-mails with Outlook, but can cause 

          formatting and subsequent viewing problems when sent or viewed with 

          other programs.  Extra Meta tags are included in the e-mail, font information 

          is complex, and the tables produced are clumsy.  Creating html pages 

          in other programs and sending them with Outlook can also be very frustrating.  

          While Outlook is a powerful e-mail program, it is not the best choice 

          for creating and sending large mailing lists. Muse News was originally 

          formatted with Net Objects Fusion.  This program worked for most people, 

          but had problems with pasting in rich text format documents.  Dreamweaver 

          has consistently produced clean, solid code.  We have had no problems 

          with compatibility after switching to this Web site formatting program. 

        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Once the e-mail has been designed and built, you need 

          to get it to your readers.  Microsoft Outlook and Qualcomm&#146;s Eudora 

          are great e-mail programs.  Each allows you to build contact lists and 

          can quickly send out e-mails.  When using one of these programs, make 

          sure the recipients&#146; names are listed under bcc: or blind carbon 

          copy.  This will hide their name from other viewers, and is much more 

          courteous. </p>

        <p class=MsoCaption><img src="drake-fig4.jpg" width="400" height="284"><br>

          Figure 4: Using the bcc: field to hide recipients</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>There are also Web-based mailing lists that your museum 

          can use for its newsletter.  Yahoo.com (<a

href="../http://groups.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">http://groups.yahoo.com</a>) and Topica.com (<a

href="../http://www.topica.com/" target="_blank">http://www.topica.com</a>) are two of the largest 

          portals for mailing lists.  These sites allow you to set up a free mailing 

          list with simple subscription/unsubscription capabilities.  You simply 

          send your newsletter to the mailing list and it is broadcast to the 

          recipients quickly and efficiently.  These mailing lists can be set 

          up either to allow announcements from your museum only or to allow readers 

          to respond to the mailings.  They can also collect demographic information 

          for your marketing department.  While these mailing lists are free to 

          join and easy to maintain, they insert advertising banners into the 

          individual e-mails.  This may create a conflict of interest for your 

          museum.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Listbuilder.com is the new variation of Microsoft&#146;s 

          ListBot.  This formerly free mailing list service now charges for the 

          ability to build and maintain mailing lists.  The newsletters are free 

          of advertisements and allow you to track the responses to links embedded 

          in the mailing.  Listbuilder (<a

href="../http://www.bcentral.com/products/lb/default.asp" target="_blank">http://www.bcentral.com/products/lb/default.asp</a>) 

          is a good alternative for museums with a small budget for e-mail marketing.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>To have an effective e-mail marketing program, you  

          need software that is meant for e-mail campaigns.  These programs allow 

          you to track the click-thrus, manage the subscriber database, set up 

          opt-in questions to focus your campaigns, quickly broadcast large numbers 

          of e-mails, handle automatic unsubscriptions and bounce-backs, and maintain 

          the security of your subscribers information.  </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>The San Diego Museum of Art is a beta testing site 

          for KeyFactor, a program designed by Stone Analytics (<a

href="../http://www.stoneanalytics.com/" target="_blank">http://www.stoneanalytics.com</a>) in San 

          Diego.  It not only handles every e-mail need, but can also analyze 

          results and suggest future mailings to specific people. Key Factor requires 

          a linux / apache server and uses a mysql database. Presently, Key Factor 

          is still under development and is not available for release.  Patron 

          Technology (<a

href="../http://www.patrontechnology.com/" target="_blank">http://www.patrontechnology.com</a>) offers 

          a similar program for distributing and maintaining mailing lists and 

          other e-mail campaigns.  It uses an ASP server and offers easy maintenance 

          and click-thru tracking.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>If you do not use an e-mail campaign software program, 

          you can still track the success of your campaigns.  If you insert a 

          &#147;?xxxxx&#148; after your Web site address, the link will still 

          work, but your Web logs will show this page separately.  Normally, when 

          someone clicks on a link in your e-mail, the Web log will show it as 

          &#147;no referrer.&#148;  When someone clicks on this page that has 

          the additional characters, such as <a

href="../http://www.sdmart.org/exhibition-american.html?musenews1-2-02" target="_blank">www.sdmart.org/exhibition-american.html?musenews1-2-02</a> 

          , the page will be shown in the Web logs as a unique page.  You can 

          now track the success of your newsletters, even if you are only using 

          Outlook or Eudora.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>When your museum is ready to create an e-mail newsletter, 

          take the time to analyze your budget, your technical abilities, and 

          the size of your projected audience.  These factors will help you choose 

          the formatting/distribution selection.  If you can afford the comprehensive 

          distribution programs, such as KeyFactor or Patron Technologies, your 

          museum will be prepared to expand e-mail marketing far beyond the newsletter.  

          If your museum wants to get your newsletter out with minimal investment, 

          the free mailing lists will be the best choice.  E-mail newsletters 

          are easy to create and manage, and can keep your museum in the minds 

          of its visitors.  Do not hesitate to try one for your museum.</p>
