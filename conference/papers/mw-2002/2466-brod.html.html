	<meta name="description" content="The Victoria & Albert Museum in London is the world's largest museum of the decorative arts and is home to 145 galleries, including national collections of sculpture, furniture, fashion and photographs. In November 2001, the V&A opened the British Galleries, its largest gallery project in over 50 years.

Covering 15 rooms the galleries offer a chronological survey of the history of design in Britain from 1500 to 1900 covering British design and art from the reign of Henry VIII to that of Queen Victoria. Virtually every major name in the history of British design is included, including designers such as William Morris and Charles Rennie Mackintosh, manufacturers such as Wedgwood and Liberty?s, and national treasures such as Henry VIII's writing desk, Queen Elizabeth I's virginals, and James II's wedding suit.

From the beginning of the 7 year project, the galleries were designed around the inclusion of multiple forms of interpretation aimed at the full range of visitors that the Museum plays host to.   Amongst some 200 interactives are 18 individual web-based applications served to 40 kiosks, 20 short films, 3 cinema films, 21 spoken audio points and 8 music points.

So how does a Museum previously criticised for being 'dull' and  'dusty' turn around visitor perception and handle the complicated interaction of screen with art, both in a physical space and on-screen? How do you weave a cross- museum team exceeding 100 people, and multiple outside contractors to deliver a usable, coherent, and maintainable system? And how do you do it with a museum budget?

This session will look at the people, processes and the pitfalls that came together to deliver the largest art gallery interactive development in the UK in recent years: a development that has seen visitor figures rise by 300%, unprecedented compliments from visitors, a BAFTA nomination for best use of new media, and the basis for the future of interactive developments at the V&A.

In depth, we will follow the 18-month prototyping and testing phase that led to the development of the detailed functional specifications that allowed the system to be developed and delivered in the final 9 months of the project. In particular, we will focus on the challenges of kiosk usability and the role of user-trials in raising usability to the level of all our audiences, and the critical question of maintaining such a large-scale, high profile development.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London is the world's largest museum 

        of the decorative arts and is home to 145 galleries, including national 

        collections of sculpture, furniture, fashion and photographs. In November 

        2001, the V&amp;A opened the British Galleries, its largest gallery project 

        in over 50 years.</p>

        The transformation of 1 of the 15 rooms of the British Galleries pre-1995. 

      </p>

      <p>Covering 15 rooms the galleries offer a chronological survey of the history 

        of design in Britain from 1500 to 1900 covering British design and art 

        from the reign of Henry VIII to that of Queen Victoria. Virtually every 

        major name in the history of British design is included, including designers 

        such as William Morris and Charles Rennie Mackintosh, manufacturers such 

        as Wedgwood and Liberty's, and national treasures such as Henry VIII's 

        writing desk, Queen Elizabeth I's virginals, and James II's wedding suit.

        Objects on Display in the British Galleries</p>

      <p>From the beginning of the 7 year project, the galleries were designed 

        around the inclusion of multiple forms of interpretation aimed at the 

        full range of visitors that the Museum plays host to. Amongst some 200 

        interactives are 18 individual web-based applications served to 40 kiosks, 

        20 short films, 3 cinema films, 21 spoken audio points and 8 music points.</p>

        Computer Interactives in use in the British Galleries</p>

      <h1>Setting up the project</h1>

      <p>In 1999, the British Galleries Project had been going on for about 4 

        years. A core team of curators and educators had been working on the overall 

        concept of the galleries working on the four themes that would tell the 

        story of British art and design. Additionally, an external consultant 

        had been hired to develop some of the ideas that might make up the computer 

        interactives and these had been worked on by the Museum team for some 

        while.</p>

      <h2>Internally</h2>

      <p>Under the guidance of the then head of IT, a decision was taken to employ 

        a Multimedia Manager who would serve as the conduit between all the internal 

        workings and provisions of the V&amp;A and 1 external agency who would 

        develop the required applications. The role would help manage the internal 

        expectations of the V&amp;A while also managing the external commercial 

        workings of the development agency. The first three months of this contract 

        were spent unpicking the Museum&#146;s internal concept work to develop 

        a brief for tender that was realistic and achievable, and clearly defined 

        the goals of usability and technical delivery of the whole project. The 

        ensuing ICT Report served as the basis for a European Design Contest that 

        was held April-July 1999.</p>

        (<a href="brodfig4b.html">detailed image</a>)</p>

      <h2>Externally</h2>

      <p>In selecting partners to work on the British Galleries, the principle 

        aim was to find an agency capable of the technical aspects of the project 

        while recognising the difficult requirements of working with a Museum. 

        After dropping an interested party list of 30 to a shortlist of 5, we 

        selected Oyster Partners based on their proven work with the Oracle database 

        platform, their widespread capabilities in interface design, and their 

        tacit understanding of our needs. We also decided to tender the audio-visual 

        portion of the project again as it was felt that no single agency had 

        demonstrated sufficient competence to deliver this segment of the project. 

        The Edge Picture Company were selected September 1999, although their 

        work is not covered in this paper.</p>

      <h1>Contract development phase </h1>

      <p>A three-year new-media project is inherently risky. My own experience 

        from the development end is of a tendency to over exploit design and technology 

        in expectation of the next version of an application, this is after all 

        how most agencies make their money. The need to lock down a contract with 

        the developers was both a requirement of the Museum, the Heritage Lottery 

        Fund who were funding most of this part of the British Galleries, and 

        my own need to avoid contractual disputes later down the project life 

        cycle. Unable to start work without a signed contract, both the V&amp;A 

        and Oyster agreed to sign the contract based on a 1 month contractual 

        development stage that would provide the base documentation of the project.</p>

      <h2>Contract Exploration </h2>

      <p>Following on from the signing of the contract, the principal project 

        documents were generated through lengthy discussion between both parties. 

        Most of the discussion here was over timescales and resource allocation 

        as well as budgets. An initial scoping of the project yielded a budget 

        of £1.8m, which was of course some way from our available £450K. By the 

        end of the explorations, the main project documents were in place as follows:</p>

      <p><b><i>Evaluation Strategy</i></b>: Offering criteria in usability, technical 

        performance, and audience relevance that would ensure consistency and 

        delivering overall project objectives from the outset to the end. Each 

        device was assigned a number of audience objectives (e.g. allow the visitor 

        to contribute to debates about aspects of the British Galleries in the 

        Visitors Online Programme). Each objective would then be assessed informally 

        throughout the prototyping phase against the usability, technical and 

        audience criteria. At the end of prototyping and at the end of the project, 

        all devices would be formally assessed for delivering their original objectives.<b></b></p>

      <p><b><i>Creative Prototyping Process and timescales</i></b>: To allow the 

        Museum to understand the process that we were about to go through. No 

        one in the museum or project team had worked on anything like this before 

        and it was vital to get expectations right from the outset. The project 

        was effectively broken into three main phases, which held true until the 

        end: Prototyping, Full development, Acceptance/Commissioning.</p>

      <p><b><i>Deliverables</i></b>: Listing the deliverables, in written reports 

        and in software that would be tied to each phase of the project (and also 

        to a payment schedule for Oyster)</p>

      <p><b><i>Quality Plan</i></b>: From the outset, DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development 

        Method) was the chosen method for developing the systems. Roughly this 

        is a clear life-cycle based approach to delivering interactive systems 

        allowing iteration at each stage of the project but also iteration throughout 

        the life-cycle all tied back to the original audience/business objectives. 

        The quality plan defines means of communication, documentation standards, 

        issue and risk escalation procedures, and sign-off authorities for each 

        aspect of the project.</p>

      <h1>Prototyping</h1>

      <p>Beginning the Creative Prototyping Process, the V&amp;A assigned British 

        Galleries team members to each of the seven proposed prototypes, each 

        representing the scope of all the final applications. The team member 

        would be responsible for explaining and iterating the concept and content 

        for each device, then delivering content for that device, and finally 

        assisting others who would develop content for the final build of that 

        device and its variants.</p>

      <p>The prototyping process was planned to have 7 distinct stages (Global 

        Design, Concept, Design 1, Build, Test, Design 2, Design 3, and Evaluation). 

        In the end, an additional phase of design was included after the first 

        design phase as the Museum could not agree on screen designs across the 

        devices. An additional Build phase replaced design 3 and this was followed 

        by a second round of public tests. We will see the effect this had on 

        timescales later on.</p>

      <h2>Global Design Phase</h2>

      <p>This innovative part of the project was included to begin the long working 

        relationship between team members and developers. It involved a series 

        of some twenty lectures, seminars, workshops and presentations conducted 

        and attended by Oysters&#146; design and technical teams, as well as V&amp;A 

        staff and external advisers. The phase was also included to open up the 

        project and its internalised situation to new ideas and new expression. 

        By allowing team members on both sides of the project to think freely 

        about existing ideas, it opened up all the interactives for greater possibilities 

        than had been considered until that time.</p>

      <p>Concurrently, the IS department worked with technological team to consider 

        underlying architecture explaining the V&amp;A&#146;s complicated technical 

        architecture and myriad systems. This allowed the formation of a technical 

        strategy that was carried through right until final delivery of the project.</p>

      <p><b><i>Delivering</i></b>: Global Design Report: listing all the possibilities 

        for interactive features that might enhance and augment the gallery experience.</p>

      <p><b><i>Outline System Architecture Definition</i></b>: proposed architecture 

        in detail explaining the database/application/presentation layer structure 

        via use of expressions and packets (sets of reusable components that could 

        together.</p>

      <h2>Concept and Content Phase </h2>

      <p>A single V&amp;A team member was assigned to each of seven prototypes 

        that would in turn represent all 18 devices. Each team member then explained 

        the background to that device in terms of its physical gallery presence, 

        its surrounding Museum objects and the subject to which it was assigned. 

        Oyster&#146;s design team then began to work these up into navigational 

        and creative concepts. These were realised with paper prototypes which 

        were assessed with each team member. The combined team also used the phase 

        to start developing a consistent language for content and navigation across 

        devices.</p>

      <h3>Design 1 Phase:</h3>

      <p>With the first iteration of concepts from the previous phase, Oyster 

        began to work up screen designs for each of the prototypes. The goal of 

        the phase was to develop a design framework working up to a Style Guide 

        to define look-and-feel across all devices. Several variations of designs 

        were made with in some cases three variations of  &#147;approved&#148; 

        designs during the phase. The duration of the phase was increased to allow 

        these variations to be encompassed and also allow the Multimedia Manager 

        to work up detailed navigational paths for each devices aimed at getting 

        approval and understanding from the project authorities.</p>

      <h3>Build 1 Phase:</h3>

      <p>Combining the 2<sup>nd</sup> variation of concepts from the previous 

        phase with the agreed screen designs, working prototypes were built according 

        to the device maps. These were built on the architecture defined in the 

        System Architecture Definition Report. The working prototypes were installed 

        to a testing rig also matching the proposed technical architecture and 

        readied for public testing. </p>

      <h3>Public Testing 1:</h3>

      <p>An external evaluator worked with the projects internal Evaluation Manager 

        and the Multimedia Manager to develop a testing methodology involving 

        observations, interviews and in some cases structured tasks. Each device 

        was tested in a public gallery being used to test other design and display 

        ideas for the British Galleries, thereby approximating the closest environment 

        of the final space for test purposes. Samples of 50-100 people were taken 

        for each device with attempts being made to get as much of the sample 

        from the target audience defined in the original Evaluation Strategy. 

        The devices were also tested in this environment with V&amp;A staff to 

        get their buy-in and reaction to the then current ideas.</p>

      <p>Concurrently, to the V&amp;A&#146;s public tests, Oyster conducted their 

        own informal evaluation of devices according to the Evaluation Strategy. 

      </p>

      <p>Each set of public tests was then analysed by the external evaluator. 

        Internal V&amp;A tests were analysed and combined with specific comments 

        of team members to develop a combined evaluation. Each evaluation was 

        then discussed jointly with the project authorities and Oyster, taking 

        into account Oyster&#146;s own evaluations, to develop a clear brief for 

        the next phase. It was at this point, that it was decided to include another 

        round of design as well as a second build and a further set of public 

        tests.</p>

      <p><b><i>Deliverables</i></b>:    Seven evaluation reports each with a specific 

        brief for design and functionality changes to each of the prototype devices.</p>

      <h3>Design Phase 2 </h3>

      <p>The public tests yielded the requirement to redesign many elements of 

        the prototypes. These were on the whole specific problems of usability 

        on one or more screens related to actual aspects of functionality for 

        that screen. In one case, a device was redesigned from scratch with an 

        entirely new structure. New designs were made for all these design problems, 

        iterated and agreed once more with the V&amp;A team.</p>

      <h3>Build Phase 2</h3>

      <p>Building on the 1<sup>st</sup> working prototype combined with the new 

        agreed screen designs, the second variation of the prototypes was built 

        and re-installed to the testing rig where they were readied for public 

        testing. </p>

      <h3>Public Testing 2:</h3>

      <p>The second round of public tests were handled internally with the methodology 

        remaining the same as for the first tests. Once again observation was 

        combined with interviews although in this set of tests, very few usability 

        problems were being analysed for each device. Only five devices required 

        retesting and in some cases, only one aspect of usability was being tested 

        and so for this set of tests, samples of 20 or less were used. </p>

      <p>The evaluations were again discussed jointly with the project authorities 

        and Oyster to develop a clear brief for the final phase of prototyping. 

      </p>

      <p><b><i>Deliverables</i></b>:    Five evaluation reports each with a specific 

        brief for design and functionality changes to each of the prototype devices.</p>

      <h3>Prototype Evaluation Phase:</h3>

      <p>Gathering all the knowledge gained during prototyping phase, the Multimedia 

        Manager developed final specifications for ALL gallery devices. Those 

        that had not been prototyped were worked into final concept form, allowing 

        the definition of all content to be prepared internally by the V&amp;A, 

        and the definition of the detailed schedule for the final development 

        phase.</p>

      <p>Oyster, meanwhile, completed their formal evaluation of the prototypes 

        to enable them to develop the final version of the Overall Style &amp; 

        Consistency Guide (defining all common design elements, fonts, colours, 

        image sizes..etc) as well as their final version of the requirements. 

        They also prepared the technical architecture report into its near final 

        version. Jointly with Oyster, final specifications were made for client 

        hardware and infrastructure technology so that this could be in place 

        for the development phase ahead.</p>

      <p>The V&amp;A by now had begun preparation of all final content. This was 

        a not inconsiderable task involving some 13,000 internal images for the 

        interactives, some 25,000 images for the database of the collection and 

        all associated textual content. Strict deadlines were set for completion 

        of most of this content (with the exception of the British Galleries Database 

        which was on a much longer content development phase).</p>

        (<a href="brodfig11.html">detailed image</a>)</p>

      <p>A break period of two months was taken between Oyster and the V&amp;A 

        to allow the V&amp;A to get on an write and edit text content, complete 

        photography and digitisation, and to allow the Oyster team a break from 

        the intensive 15 months that had now ended.</p>

      <p class=normal>All proved by:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>4. A continuing series of informal and formal evaluations 

        against agreed criteria of usability, audience relevance and technical

      <p class=BlockQuote> 5. The complete development and delivery of content, 

        software, hardware and infrastructure in a 9 month period before opening 

        of the galleries.</p>

      <h2>Development Phase 2</h2>

      <p>Following a two month break period with Oyster, Oyster commenced with 

        the full-build of all gallery devices around March 2002. Prior to this 

        commencement, minor changes were made to the concepts of those devices 

        that had not been prototyped. Principally, these changes were removing 

        functionality deemed too hard to deliver and clarifying details of content 

        and functionality. Nonetheless, the build of all programmes was begun 

        on a schedule of phased delivery with devices being delivered in time 

        for content to be entered into them.</p>

      <h3>Style Guides</h3>

      <p>Located on 9 kiosks throughout the 15 rooms within the British Galleries, 

        these kiosks help people to recognise the styles of decorative arts from 

        the Renaissance through to the Scottish School. Each one teaches people 

        to recognise the terminology and forms that make up that style supported 

        by the people and buildings related to that style, while allowing visitors 

        to test their knowledge with a quiz. There is one style guide for each 

        of the 21 styles dealt with in gallery based subjects. </p>

      <h3>Explore Devices</h3>

      <p>Centred on 2 paintings in the galleries, these use the paintings in the 

        galleries to help people understand the social and political history of 

        the time that the paintings were created. Each painting is divided into 

        5 categories. Visitors can explore each category for &#147;Items&#148; 

        either by &#147;SCAN&#148;, a visual exploration of the painting, or by 

        &#147;INDEX&#148;, a textual exploration of the painting. Each &#147;Item&#148; 

        is itself related to many &#147;Themes&#148; that offer broader information 

        than the more basic &#147;Item pages&#148;.</p>

      <h3>British Galleries Online</h3>

      <p>The British Galleries Online Database is a database of the collection 

        of objects that will be contained in the British Galleries. </p>

      <p>It has been designed and structured to offer a number of different routes 

        for visitors to access objects according to their own interests or preferences. 

        It can be described as a top-down system, in that the visitor makes successive 

        choices through the routes to narrow down their selections before arriving 

        at the principal screen for a single object.</p>

      <p>Every object has a principal screen that includes an image of the object, 

        the label that is used for the object in its gallery setting and a specially 

        written record to provide further information on the object. </p>

      <p>The system has been designed to provide visual and textual navigation 

        throughout. Visitors can make their choices by image or by text and this 

        has proved to be extremely effective in tests on the system with members 

        of the public.</p>

      <h3>Interactives Management System</h3>

      <p>The Interactives Management System is an underlying application content 

        and kiosk management system that allowed and still allows the V&amp;A 

        to create new applications and update existing ones from scratch. It also 

        allows the chain of editorial systems to control the Visitors Online programme 

        allowing the V&amp;A to change and manage debates and online history projects. 

        The IMS also contains the BGO validator which periodically extracts data 

        from the V&amp;A&#146;s own collection database into the database that 

        drives the public system. This allows us to keep check on our own data 

        and grow the BGO over the coming years without relying on further cost 

        to Oyster.</p>

      <p>The main function of the IMS is to manage the day to day operation of 

        kiosks throughout the galleries. Kiosks can be assigned new applications, 

        printers, and shut-down or restarted in the event of any software failures. 

        This allows relatively untrained gallery staff to handle all of the 1<sup>st</sup> 

        line support of technology in the gallery spaces and this is a process 

        that is proving to work well.</p>

      <h2>Commissioning &amp; Installation</h2>

      <p>Despite a smooth end to the software development, the commissioning stages 

        of the project were frantic. The construction side of the project was 

        late compressing a planned six month installation of equipment into just 

        6 weeks. This meant that Acceptance testing which was carried out in three 

        waves was begun before the final completion of software. Since some applications 

        were completed before others, these were tested for content and functionality 

        over the internet by various people at the V&amp;A. Three tests were run 

        against each acceptance script by the Multimedia Manager, a volunteer 

        student and in some cases, device managers. The last wave of testing was 

        completed once the system had been commissioned to the galleries. An agreed 

        project closure process ensure that at least the contractual close of 

        the project happened on time just 8 days prior to public opening. The 

        main problems came from an inability to test printing (one of the riskiest 

        parts of the operational system) due to the network having not been adequately 

        completed in printing areas.</p>

      <p>Despite the end of the project, the galleries opened to the public on 

        21<sup>st</sup> November and have seen a rise of 200% in visitor numbers 

        to the V&amp;A. A daily walk through the galleries will find almost continuous 

        use of many of the interactives. Comments made in the Visitors Online 

        programme testify to the success and level of visitor satisfcation. Initial 

        webstat analysis on the site has shown over 13million hits on some 4 million 

        page impressions to the collective system. There have been 3 system failures 

        due to poor server maintenance but the system has been fully operational 

        and stable since the beginning of February.</p>

      <h1>The Future</h1>

      <p>The British Galleries project served a number of purposes to the V&amp;A. 

        Aside from helping the repositioning of the Museum in the public eye as 

        an interesting and educational experience, it has proved to the Museum 

        that there is a significant role for interactives in physical gallery 

        spaces. The underlying architecture and operational running of these has 

        offered the V&amp;A a basis on which to proliferate future interactives 

        in other galleries as well as provide a model for how these projects can 

        be achieved. The methodology behind this prospect consists of the development 

        of further &#147;types&#148; of interactive to provide a common framework 

        throughout the Museum&#146;s physical space. The types of interactive 

        will be developed to provide for the whole range of V&amp;A audiences 

        with experiences focussed around supporting the ability to understand 

        the objects on display and the subjects around them. It is expected that 

        underpinning most of these types of interactives will be further instances 

        of collection database offering access to the wealth of the Museum&#146;s 

        knowledge about its objects and the subjects that surround them.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Architecture of future V&amp;A interactive application 

        delivery<br>

        (<a href="brodfig26.html">detailed image</a>)</p>

      <p>In this architecture, the V&amp;A will maintain its variety of collection 

        information systems as the core source of content for interactives. An 

        asset management system allows the V&amp;A to tailor content in these 

        core systems for delivery in individual projects be they gallery or web-based. 

        This involves importing and configuring the data for delivery in a future 

        application. Using an overarching Applications Management System, the 

        content in the asset management system is then assigned/linked and stored 

        for delivery to both gallery and web modules. The realities of conflicting 

        bandwidth availability to these two principal channels requires us to 

        consider separate instances of the same types of applications for gallery 

        and web delivery. The Applications Management System also allows the development 

        of new types of interactives as they arise in future years. Interactives 

        are then delivered to their respective channels via deployment modules 

        equatable to separate delivery systems. In the long term, gallery interactives 

        while requiring high-bandwidth, have low load requirements due to the 

        limited number of users allowable in a Museum space. The web, while requiring 

        lo-bandwidth, has high load requirements and consequently, the architecture 

        allows for separate deployments to both to allow stability for both channels. 

        Finally, ensuring operation stability, the Applications Management System 

        allows for operation control and editorial interaction for all interactives, 

        a critical part of maintaining any developed system.</p>
