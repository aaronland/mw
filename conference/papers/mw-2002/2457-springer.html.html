      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>This paper reviews the first stage of a technology 

        initiative to assist K-12 teachers in developing Web projects that integrate 

        K-12 curriculum content and the art collections of the National Gallery 

        of Art.  A select number of these projects will be made available on the 

        Gallery&#146;s Web site (<a href="../http://www.nga.gov/" target="_blank">www.nga.gov</a>).  

        While the Gallery has offered education resources through its Web site 

        since the sites inception in 1997, this program marks the first significant 

        effort to provide on-line teaching resources that are designed by K-12 

        educators.  The program&#146;s goals, design, and evaluation objectives 

        are summarized by the two staff members primarily responsible for the 

        initiative&#146;s  conception and planning.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Keywords: teachers, art museums, instructional technology, 

        online resources</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>&#147;2001: A Cyberspace Odyssey&#148; was the beginning 

        of a two-year technology initiative in which selected groups of K-12 teachers 

        collaborated with the National Gallery&#146;s education department and 

        Web team to create online teaching resources to be published on the Gallery&#146;s 

        Web site. The program is an outgrowth of the Gallery&#146;s annual summer 

        Teacher Institute, in which teachers from across the United States come 

        to learn about the Gallery&#146;s collections and how to incorporate art 

        resources into their lesson planning. &#147;Cyberspace Odyssey&#148; is 

        the two-year expansion of this program into a &#147;hands-on&#148; workshop 

        that integrates the museum collections and teacher experiences through 

        art and technology. </p>

      <h1>Program Goals</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The overall goals of the two-year program are to help 

        Gallery staff gain firsthand knowledge of the type of on-line resources 

        that are most useful to teachers, to encourage teachers in learning to 

        create Web-based arts education resources, and to expand the Gallery&#146;s 

        distance learning resources. More specifically, the goals and benefits 

        of the program are as follows:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Creation of pertinent resources: 

          created by teachers, these on-line projects will better match K-12 curriculum 

          content with the practical considerations of classroom instruction and 

          independent research. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Creation of learner-driven models: 

          because of their potential for interactivity, these on-line projects 

          will be viable in school settings favoring learner-driven or constructivist 

          education models.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Enhancement of skills: charged 

          with conceptualizing and building their own Web-based curriculum projects, 

          teachers will enhance their skills and increase their use of on-line 

          technologies.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Expansion of distance learning 

          resources: a selection of the finished projects will be developed for 

          use on the Gallery&#146;s Web site.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Distance learning has been a key part of the Gallery&#146;s 

        mission since the museum opened its doors to the public in 1941.  Films, 

        slide programs, teaching packets, CD-ROMS, and videodiscs have long been 

        available to teachers and other adult audiences on a free-loan basis.  

        The advent of the Web, and the Gallery&#146;s Web site in 1997, brought 

        more immediate, versatile, and dynamic means through which to foster awareness 

        of the visual arts and make the Gallery&#146;s collections widely accessible.  

        Exhibition literature, teaching packets, lessons and activities, and interactive 

        virtual tours are among the many educational resources available on the 

        Gallery&#146;s site. The finished projects from the Cyberspace Odyssey 

        program will extend our distance learning resources and better serve those 

        educators without firsthand access to the Gallery&#146;s collections.</p>

      <h1>Team Selection and Agenda</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Educators were asked to apply in teams of three and 

        to submit a joint statement outlining their collective qualifications 

        and the Web project they would develop if selected to participate.  They 

        were not required to be from the same school, but were asked to agree 

        to collaborate with their teammates for the eight months to conceptualize, 

        build, field-test, and finalize their project.  It was recommended that 

        team members possess different areas of expertise, each of which contributed 

        to their particular curriculum topic.  Individuals selected to participate 

        received a stipend of $1,000 with an additional $500 payable on completion 

        of their team&#146;s on-line project. The successful teams were those 

        demonstrating sophisticated computer and Internet skills, experience with 

        curriculum development, and commitment to teaching through online technologies.  

      </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Twelve three-member teams were selected from approximately 

        seventy applicants, based on the strength of their proposed curriculum 

        projects.  Successful team applicants were those who proposed creative 

        ways of using the Gallery&#146;s collection and envisioned how the Web 

        could best convey their choice of content. At lease one team member was 

        required to have some experience with Web-based lessons. Selected topics 

        ranged from a math lesson that incorporated the angles of the Gallery&#146;s 

        East Building to a study of the connections between art and music. Priority 

        was given to creative topics that made meaningful use of the Gallery&#146;s 

        collections and targeted a specific grade (or age group), subject area(s), 

        and national standards for K-12 curricula.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Six teams came to the Gallery for a week-long seminar 

        in July, 2001, while the other six received the same instruction in August, 

        2001. During the program, teams worked with education and computer technology 

        specialists to begin developing the content and storyboards for their 

        Web resources.  Instructors were Gallery staff and outside experts in 

        art, education, and instructional technologies.  The course of instruction 

        was sequenced to help teachers explore the potential richness of on-line 

        resources, analyze and critique select sites focused on art and education, 

        and establish criteria for high-quality Web site content and design before 

        beginning to build their own projects.  Toward this end, teams were asked 

        to prepare for their week in Washington by studying and critiquing a pre-selected 

        list of Web sites and by reading two books pertaining to on-line curriculum 

        design.  One book (Harris 1998) was chosen to provide a general introduction 

        to the development and implementation of different types of Internet projects, 

        depending on content objectives and desired outcomes.  The other publication 

        (Williams and Tollett 2000) addressed Web design and production issues.  

        This preparatory work allowed participants to arrive at the Gallery with 

        shared knowledge and a framework for group discussion.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>During the seminar, teachers were offered training 

        in HTML and Dreamweaver, and were given packages of software with which 

        to develop their projects (Adobe Photoshop 6.0; Macromedia Dreamweaver 

        4 with Fireworks 4 Studio; and Inspiration 6).  Teams also learned more 

        about the Gallery&#146;s permanent collections and which objects might 

        best support the content of their on-line curriculum project&#151;be it 

        related to math, music, Renaissance history, or autobiographical writing&#151;to 

        name just a few of the subject areas chosen.  At the end of the week, 

        each team gave a brief presentation on the direction of its project.  

        These presentations revealed that most teams had become more focused throughout 

        the week in terms of the theme and resources they would pursue, while 

        others had begun to conceptualize the underlying structure of the lesson.</p>

      <h1>Team Commitment </h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Teams were asked to continue their collaboration through 

        the completion of their Web projects in April 2002. During these months 

        they were responsible for developing a storyboard of the project, selecting 

        visuals, integrating content and images in HTML pages, testing the project 

        in the classroom, and submitting a final project. Each team was assigned 

        two mentors with whom to consult about either the content or the technological 

        development of their projects.  A listserve was established to facilitate 

        communication among the groups.  In addition, teachers had access to a 

        password-protected Web site that offered easy reference to project guidelines 

        and deadlines, links to educational resources, mentors&#146; and colleagues&#146; 

        names and e-mail addresses, and separate work folders for submitting the 

        individual stages of their projects (Fig. 1).</p>

        <span class="MsoCaption">Figure 1: Home page of the password-protected 

        Web site designed to support teachers during the design and construction 

        of their online curriculum projects.</span></p>

      <h1>Evaluation</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Evaluation of the 2001 and 2002 programs will seek 

        to measure the achievement of two objectives: 1) providing useful Web 

        resources for K-12 educators, and 2) increasing Institute participants&#146; 

        skills and comfort levels using on-line technologies.  Useful Web resources 

        are defined as those published and used on the Gallery&#146;s Web site, 

        and those remaining unpublished but actively used in the classroom by 

        their creators. Evaluation will assess both content quality and usability 

        of sites.  Methods employed will include direct observation of site use 

        (by either teachers or students, depending on the intended audience), 

        and interview sampling techniques designed to gauge user reaction to content 

        and navigability.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Questionnaires will also be used to solicit participants&#146; 

        affective, or attitudinal, responses to the program and the process of 

        building the Web projects.  The first of these, available on-line at the 

        password-protected Web site, asked participants to evaluate the instructional 

        design of the week-long summer seminar and estimate how well it prepared 

        them for the task of conceptualizing and building their curriculum projects.  

        Participant response to this initial survey (40 percent) was very positive. 

        We now face the challenge of incorporating these suggestions, along with 

        our own perceptions of the experience, into the program for the summer 

        of 2002. </p>
