      <h2>Introduction  </h2>

      <p>In their definition of the interactive museum experience, Falk and Dierking 

        (1992) described three key elements that influence the way visitors experience 

        museums: the physical context, the personal context and the social context. 

        Physical context mainly covers the physical layout of the space and has 

        been extensively studied by designers (Communications Design Team, 1976) 

        and more recently by space syntax theoreticians (Psarra, Grajewski &amp; 

        O&#146;Neil, 2002). Personal context covers the prior knowledge of the 

        visitors, their personal aims and expectations, and their current state 

        of mind. Personal context and its influence on the learning experience 

        have also been studied by means of evaluation teams and learning theories 

        such as constructivism and Gardner&#146;s multiple intelligences theory. 

        Last, but not least, social context covers the social interaction during 

        the museum visit between the visitors and their immediate companions, 

        as well as other visitors and museum staff. Several aspects of the social 

        context in a physical museum setting have been examined, focusing mainly 

        on school groups and families (Diamond, 1986; McManus, 1987; Falk &amp; 

        Dierking, 1992). More recently, social scientists in the <i>SHAPE</i> 

        project also examined the social cues in the interaction with displays 

        (Vom Lehn, Heath &amp; Hindmarsh, 2001).</p>

      <p>This paper further examines social context in museums, and its technological 

        support. We are especially interested in social context among new audiences 

        who visit museums via the Web and 3D virtual reality applications. While 

        studies of traditional museum audiences have shown the importance of social 

        context, new media as used in museums do not often support social interaction. 

        In studying both traditional museums and new technologies, we aim to address 

        issues such as how to integrate visits to the virtual museum with visits 

        to the &#145;physical&#146; museum, especially when a visitor may visit 

        both. This is partly a response to the way that the number of digital 

        visitors is steadily growing and, in some cases, outstripping the number 

        of visitors to the corresponding physical museums (Lord, 1999). As a result, 

        many wish to find ways to encourage the geographically distant digital 

        visitor to become a physical visitor, and to encourage physical visitors 

        to maintain a relationship with the museum after they walk out its door. 

      </p>

      <p>Our project, <i>City,</i> investigates ways to support and enrich context 

        in museums, cultural institutions and the city&#151;in particular, social 

        context. Set within a research consortium called Equator (<a href="../http://www.equator.ac.uk/" target="_blank">www.equator.ac.uk</a>), 

        our work is on context that involves something richer and more complex 

        than a collection of isolated media and disjointed pieces of information. 

        Computer scientists as well as museum professionals&#151;for different 

        reasons&#151;tend to focus on the obvious differences between traditional 

        and digital media, and treat each one independently. Here, a broader viewpoint 

        takes account of their similarities and interdependencies.</p>

      <p>We initially discuss our approach to understanding and working with social 

        context, pointing out prior work in both traditional and digital media. 

        We then present two parallel lines of work that share a theme: the architect, 

        designer and artist, Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928). We report 

        on studies of social interaction in existing museums and exhibitions, 

        and on a system infrastructure and prototype to bridge digital and physical 

        visits to an exhibition room and its collection of artifacts. This prototype 

        supports interaction between people visiting or exploring the room, even 

        though they use quite different media: wearable computers, hypermedia 

        and virtual environments. Thus a visitor using any one of these styles 

        can interact with other visitors using other media. We offer some initial 

        observations on the use of our prototype system before outlining our ongoing 

        and planned work.</p>

      <h2>Social context</h2>

      <p>We approach the issue of social context by considering interaction between 

        visitors. We initially use a deliberately naïve categorization of context, 

        dividing it in terms of time, space and medium. First, interaction may 

        be synchronous or asynchronous. Secondly, it may occur locally, within 

        the museum, or remotely, with at least one visitor being physically located 

        beyond its walls. Thirdly, it may involve digital media such as Web sites 

        and virtual environments, or traditional &#145;physical&#146; media such 

        as the museum building itself, displays and, of course, the artefacts 

        of the museum collection.</p>

      <p>One experiences synchronous social awareness when visiting a museum with 

        some friends or as a member of a larger group: one&#146;s <i>co&#150;visitors</i>. 

        The design of the exhibition space, through its layout, displays, artefacts 

        and supporting materials, clearly influences the visitor&#146;s movement 

        and activity, but the way co&#150;visitors move around the space is also 

        influential. Other visitors who happen to be in the museum at the same 

        time may also have an effect, as may those who visited at some time in 

        the past.</p>

      <p>This latter influence, asynchronous social awareness, is a key feature 

        of the museum experience. Traditionally afforded comment books, visitors 

        can write about what they did or felt during their museum experience. 

        Any later visitor can read the comments; i.e. the communication is not 

        generally personalized or directed towards any one particular reader. 

        Recently entire exhibitions and displays have revolved around this notion 

        of social context. For example, in London, visitors to the Science Museum 

        (<a href="../http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.sciencemuseum.org.uk</a>) 

        can read other visitors&#146; opinions on controversial issues, and in 

        the interactive games of the Wellcome Wing can compare their results with 

        those of previous visitors. Visitors also have the opportunity to create 

        a Web page with the highlights of their visit, and access it later online 

        with their friends and family. This raises the issue of whether and how 

        to structure, curate or select from such contributed &#145;collections&#146; 

        as they grow in size and value.</p>

      <p>Web sites may offer various forms of social awareness. These may be synchronous, 

        as in chat rooms, or asynchronous, as in mailing lists and recommendations. 

        Awareness much like that of comment books is afforded by, for example, 

        the Amazon.com bookstore. One can leave comments about specific books, 

        CDs and so forth, and can read comments from earlier visitors. However, 

        dynamic and personalized information can be cheaply offered when compared 

        to traditional media. For example, each Amazon visitor&#146;s profile 

        of movement around and purchases from the site is dynamically combined 

        with others in creating recommendations for the individual, i.e. selections 

        from the many items sold by Amazon, based on the match between a visitor&#146;s 

        profile and those of earlier visitors. Each movement and purchase leads 

        to different personalized recommendations. The <i>Hippie</i> (Oppermann 

        &amp; Specht, 1999) and the <i>SottoVoce</i> projects (Aoki &amp; Woodruff, 

        2000) have already explored many of the issues involved in the personalized 

        delivery of content in a museum environment but, as far as we know, recommender 

        systems have not yet been applied in museums<i>.</i> </p>

      <p>Synchronous social interaction is also a key feature in virtual environments. 

        The vast computer game industry is centred on such technology, and is 

        now exploring the possibilities of collaborative game playing on-line. 

        Furthermore, chat channels such as Active Worlds (<a href="../http://www.activeworlds.com/" target="_blank">www.activeworlds.com</a>) 

        combine directed textual communication with graphical representation of 

        users as avatars. Museums and related institutions have explored the same 

        medium, but for purposes such as the presentation of artefacts too fragile 

        or numerous to be put on display and of reconstructed archaeological sites, 

        and in supporting geographically distant visitors. Such a medium supports 

        social interaction between visitors, as in the Virtual Leonardo project 

        in the National Museum of Science and Technology in Milan (<a href="../http://www.museoscienza.org/" target="_blank">www.museoscienza.org</a>), 

        and the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (<a href="../http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/" target="_blank">www.vangoghmuseum.nl</a>). 

        Web users share a common representation of the museum and are afforded 

        basic resources for social interaction: mutual visibility and audibility. 

        Immersive VR technology, such as head&#150;mounted displays and room&#150;sized 

        (and room&#150;shaped) projection surfaces, is used in a number of cultural 

        institutions, e.g. the Foundation of the Hellenic World (<a href="../http://www.fhw.gr/" target="_blank">www.fhw.gr</a>). 

        Relatively little support is given in such systems for asynchronous awareness, 

        however.</p>

      <p>Most research on museums and the Web has, we suggest, tended to treat 

        local and remote visitors in isolation from each other, and to treat traditional 

        and digital media similarly. To our knowledge, there has been little or 

        no work that bridges between local and remote, and between traditional 

        and digital media. However, those who visit the digital museum may visit 

        the traditional museum, and vice versa. Previously seen digital information 

        may influence a visitor&#146;s interpretation of traditional displays 

        and artefacts, and vice versa. New technologies let visitors to the traditional 

        museum interact with digital visitors, and combine traditional and digital 

        media, in the same experience.</p>

      <p>In order to deepen our understanding of social context, we have undertaken 

        a pair of ongoing studies of social awareness and context in traditional 

        museums and cultural institutions. These are described in the next section. 

        We then describe a parallel stream of activity within our project, building 

        a technological infrastructure for co&#150;visiting and synchronous social 

        context that crosses or blurs the boundaries between visitors who are 

        local and remote, and between digital and traditional media. As described 

        in a later section, ongoing and future work is directed towards applying 

        the results of our studies to our systems, especially with regard to more 

        explicit support for the roles visitors take with regard to each other, 

        and towards asynchronous interaction.</p>

      <h2>Studies </h2>

      <p>In collaboration with two institutions in Glasgow, The Lighthouse (<a href="../http://www.thelighthouse.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.thelighthouse.co.uk</a>) 

        and the House for an Art Lover (<a href="../http://www.houseforanartlover.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.houseforanartlover.co.uk</a>), 

        we are carrying out two sets of visitor studies of qualitative character. 

        Our methodology is influenced by recent qualitative museum visitor studies 

        as well as by ethnographic and anthropological methods used in social 

        sciences and recently in computing science. Our aim is to better understand 

        the relationship between the visitor and the social context and environment 

        of the visit. These studies, unlike the majority of the visitor studies 

        conducted in the museum sector, do not look at interactions around specific 

        displays or temporary exhibitions. Instead, both studies are situated 

        in permanent exhibitions. </p>

      <p>We believe that qualitative methods, such as naturalistic ethnography, 

        in the exploration of visitors' interaction are necessary to achieve a 

        better understanding of &#145;how visitors see things, and what meanings 

        they give to their experiences, rather than simply to enumerate frequencies 

        for pre-formed categories&#146; (MacDonald, 1993). Furthermore, our corpus 

        of observations can be used to address either of two related issues: the 

        generation and delivery of content, and social interaction during the 

        visit. The latter will be the main focus of the following discussion.</p>

      <p>The two institutions were chosen because they share the same topic, Mackintosh, 

        but they explore different ways of engaging the visitor. The Lighthouse 

        has developed an interpretation centre, often simply called the Mack Room, 

        with a number of original objects intermixed with 23 workstations and 

        displays that convey a substantial amount of digital information. The 

        House for an Art Lover is a recently constructed house, but built, decorated 

        and furnished according to Mackintosh&#146;s entry to a 1901 design exhibition. 

        It is widely perceived as a historic house attraction, and a visitor is 

        offered a leaflet and an audioguide that describe the construction project 

        and Mackintosh&#146;s work.</p>

      <p>In the Lighthouse we watched visitors and in eight cases manually recorded 

        their movements on a map. In the House for an Art Lover we conducted participant 

        observation of visitors for six days within a period of two months. In 

        both locations, we used photographs and notes to add to our record of 

        visitor activity. We also obtained some other sources of information regarding 

        visitor experience. We were offered copies of the Mack Room designer's 

        architectural drawings, showing the expected flow of archetypal visitors 

        around the exhibits in the Mack Room, along with notes on the expected 

        experiences gained by following such paths. In the House for an Art Lover, 

        we were given access to the results of a marketing survey of visitors.</p>

      <p>In our studies we concentrated on &#145;casual visitors&#146; (Falk &amp; 

        Dierking, 1992) in groups or as singletons, rather than the more structured 

        visits of school groups and families. We focused on interpersonal interaction, 

        and also observed how the information delivery media available in the 

        gallery, such as audioguides, touch-screens, videos, labels and so forth, 

        influenced this interaction.</p>

      <p>We categorized the interaction between co-visitors into three main styles. 

        In the first, co&#150;visitors are tightly connected, staying together 

        during their visit, and interacting with the same display at the same 

        time. In the second style, co-visitors are loosely connected:  they interact 

        with different displays, but in the same area and thus stay relatively 

        close to each other. Thirdly, co&#150;visitors are independent navigators, 

        following their own individual routes for the main part of the visit and 

        meeting with each other only occasionally.</p>

      <p>In tightly connected interaction, co&#150;visitors stay close to each 

        other as they actively and collaboratively interact with the displays, 

        discussing artefacts and their descriptions. An important influence on 

        this style of interaction is the background knowledge of visitors and 

        their history of previous visits to the gallery. The most experienced 

        usually leads the interaction by operating the touch screens (Fig.1), 

        or by pointing out details not obvious from the labels/commentaries (Fig. 

        2). Different co&#150;visitors may undertake the leading role at different 

        times during a visit.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="galani.fig1.jpg" width="300" height="425"><br>

        Figure 1. An interactive display in the Mack Room is operated by a visitor 

        with more background knowledge of the exhibition than his co&#150;visitor.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="galani.fig2.jpg" width="300" height="291"><br>

        Figure 2. The visitor on the right, who has been in the House for an Art 

        Lover several times before, points out and describes to her co&#150;visitor 

        a less obvious feature of the ceiling lights&#146; design</p>

      <p>The pace of the visit is an essential factor in this style. People usually 

        share their interests in the displays and also share a pace of reading 

        the available material. They also decide together where to go next. This 

        style of interaction occurs quite often in galleries where information 

        is not easily available or accessed, so people tend to move around together 

        and help each other to interpret the exhibits. </p>

      <p>In the second style of interaction, co&#150;visitors are loosely connected. 

        These visitors do not consistently interact with the same objects and 

        displays, but stay close enough to maintain an awareness of each other. 

        They usually exchange brief comments about what they have seen and point 

        things out to each other. They may be very close to each other but engaged 

        in quite different information, as in the leaflet reader and audioguide 

        listener in Figure 3, and may attend to different displays at any given 

        moment, as in Figure 4.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="galani.fig3.jpg" width="300" height="428"><br>

        Figure 3. Although close by each other, these two co&#150;visitors in 

        the House for an Art Lover are attending to different sources of information: 

        an audioguide and a leaflet respectively</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="galani.fig4.jpg" width="300" height="430"><br>

        Figure 4. This couple is walking round the Mack Room together, but the 

        woman on the right interacts with a touch screen while her companion, 

        on the left, looks over her shoulder at a video display.</p>

      <p>Visitors using audioguides usually experience this style of interaction. 

        The audioguide often works as a resource for discussion despite the fact 

        the device itself is not designed to support explicit interaction between 

        visitors. This style of co-visiting also seems to favour gestural communication: 

        a person may want to share an experience but not to interrupt the companion&#146;s 

        experience, so favours hand gestures or eyebrow movements rather than 

        verbal communication.</p>

      <p>Independent navigation occurs in co&#150;visitors who visit displays 

        separately from each other. Each person has an individual pace, resulting 

        sometimes in people waiting for the co&#150;visitors outside the galleries, 

        or &#145;slow&#146; visitors cutting their visits short in order to catch 

        up with others. Repeat visitors to the gallery often follow this style, 

        and in some cases they leave the immediate space of the gallery and proceed 

        to another room. Repeat visitors also tend to not take the audioguide 

        at all or to consult it very infrequently compared to less experienced 

        co&#150;visitors.</p>

      <p>This style of co-visiting includes many meeting points between the members 

        of the group: sometimes accidental, sometimes deliberate. For example, 

        two co&#150;visitors may meet accidentally when their independent paths 

        cross in a display that is of interest to both. In order to deliberately 

        meet, one visitor may change navigation in the space, moving very quickly 

        between points with good visibility in the gallery in order to find the 

        co&#150;visitor. Regardless of the way people meet, they discuss what 

        they have seen in their individual tours, or suggest displays to each 

        other&#151;in some cases almost dragging their companions to show them 

        a specific display. They also discuss the logistics of the visit; for 

        example, where to go next, when they will have lunch, and so forth.</p>

      <p>It is important to point out visitors do not rigidly conform to the same 

        archetypal style of interaction during a visit. In all observed cases, 

        co&#150;visitors experienced their immediate social context through direct 

        and close interaction at some times, and peripheral awareness at other 

        times. Each co-visitor takes advantage of a dynamically changing set of 

        resources. We identified mutual audibility, mutual visibility and shared 

        content as essential resources in co-visiting. These three do not influence 

        each of the interaction styles described above to the same extent.</p>

      <p>Closely connected co&#150;visitors use all three of the resources extensively. 

        They have concrete knowledge of their companions&#146; locations and orientations, 

        which are often similar to their own. They talk almost constantly with 

        each other, and share content whether in the form of touch screens, video 

        screens or labels. They can share and explore interpretations of content 

        seen or heard previously. Loosely connected co&#150;visitors are also 

        aware of each other&#146;s location and possibly orientation at any given 

        moment. They use verbal or gestural communication, but they do not necessarily 

        share content synchronously. Finally, independent navigators are only 

        peripherally aware of their companions&#146; locations. Such a visitor 

        will usually inform co&#150;visitors in a room when about to leave it, 

        and indicate a destination, if their mutual awareness extends beyond a 

        single room. They do not constantly share other resources but are potential 

        users of all of them during meetings.</p>

      <h2>The Current System</h2>

      <p>In parallel with our studies, we have developed a system to explore social 

        context that bridges or blurs the boundaries between visitors who are 

        local and remote, and between digital and physical. The system involves 

        three types of visitors: someone walking around the Mackintosh Room with 

        a wearable computer, someone remote from the Mack Room but moving through 

        Web pages related to the room, and another remote visitor using a VR model 

        of the Mack Room.</p>

      <p>A set of scenarios (Chalmers, 2001; Galani, 2001) was used to further 

        explore the concept of co-visiting in museums and the city, and as a focus 

        for system design. In our current scenario a visitor to Glasgow, Vee, 

        visits the Mack Room in The Lighthouse. While browsing the displays, she 

        invites her friend Anna, who is some distance away, to join her on the 

        visit. Anna joins in by accessing an on-line 3D model of the room. A third 

        friend, Dub, is then invited; he joins them by accessing the Web site 

        for the room. The scenario introduces three different visitors who are 

        remote from each other, and who have access to different technologies. 

        Such scenarios have proved an effective way for a diverse team of researchers 

        to communicate with each other, allowing us to shift our focus between 

        studies, design, implementation and evaluation while maintaining a common 

        context. </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="galani.fig5.jpg" width="390" height="327"><br>

        Figure 5. Bristol University&#146;s CyberJacket is worn by the &#145;physical&#146; 

        visitor in the Mack Room (on the right of the picture), and has location 

        and orientation sensors for a handheld computer.</p>

      <p>Vee, or the visitor in the role of Vee, has a handheld computer, an HP 

        Jornada, which supports wireless network communications. She also has 

        a jacket&#151;Bristol University&#146;s <i>CyberJacket, </i>shown in Figure 

        5&#151;that has within or on it several devices: an ultrasound detector 

        to register position within the room (Randell &amp; Muller, 2001), an 

        electronic compass to show orientation, and a battery. Cables within the 

        jacket connect these parts to each other and to the handheld. The recorded 

        position is updated every few seconds and sent off to another &#145;server&#146; 

        computer (hidden behind the reception desk of the Mack Room). The handheld 

        computer can be used to browse pages about the Mack Room&#146;s displays 

        and artefacts based on the exhibition&#146;s catalogue and delivered from 

        the Web server on the local network. A number of those pages generally 

        describe thematic zones within the room. We support automatic triggering 

        of those pages: if Vee walks into a thematic zone within the room, a Web 

        page for that zone is automatically displayed.</p>

      <p>Dub has a normal Web browser running on a laptop computer. We currently 

        set this laptop in The Lighthouse but away from the Mack Room, and connect 

        it to the local network. He can browse pages about the Mack Room, and 

        by tracking the zone associated with each page displayed, we imply a &#145;position&#146; 

        in the room for him.</p>

      <p>Anna uses a VR model of the Mack Room as well as a Web browser. Unlike 

        the Web visitor, Anna&#146;s position is her position within the virtual 

        environment. We initially experimented with the room-sized immersive VR 

        display (ReaCTOR) at University College London (UCL), but current experimentation 

        happens within The Lighthouse, where we use another networked laptop showing 

        simpler &#145;desktop VR&#146; graphics.</p>

      <p>Each visitor has a microphone and headphones, and can talk with the other 

        two. We initially used mobile telephones to support conversation, but 

        now have audio connections within our system. Each visitor can see personal 

        location as well as locations of the others. Vee and Dub each have a map 

        showing the Mack Room set within their Web page and showing visitors&#146; 

        ongoing positions as dots, as in Figure 6. Anna has her co&#150;visitors 

        shown as avatars, as in Figure 7.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="galani.fig6.jpg" width="300" height="438"><br>

        Figure 6. The web visitor, Dub, sees a map of the Mack Room showing the 

        positions of himself and his co&#150;visitors, and the outlines of thematic 

        zones.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="galani.fig7.jpg" width="390" height="292"><br>

        Figure 7. The view of the VR visitor, Anna, shows the Mack Room and avatars 

        of her co&#150;visitors.</p>

      <p>A server computer assists the visitors&#146; personal systems. This runs 

        a Web server based on the <i>Linky</i> software (<a href="../http://www.equator.ecs.soton.ac.uk/technology/leaky/leaky.shtml" target="_blank">www.equator.ecs.soton.ac.uk/technology/leaky/leaky.shtml</a>) 

        developed by the University of Southampton to deliver hypermedia tailored 

        to the context of the visitor. At the moment, the &#145;context&#146; 

        used by this software is the visitor&#146;s location and the size of the 

        display. Linky models associations between artefacts, zones and hypermedia 

        content and, when delivering a Web page for such a location, it can use 

        these associations to add descriptions of other things to see and places 

        to move to. The server computer also runs software, called <i>EQUIP</i> 

        (<a href="../http://www.equator.ac.uk/technology/equip/index.htm" target="_blank">www.equator.ac.uk/technology/equip/index.htm</a>), 

        that collects the positions of the various visitors, relates them to zones, 

        and triggers any automatic display of Web pages, maps and avatars. EQUIP 

        also handles audio streams between visitors. </p>

      <h2>Experimenting with the System </h2>

      <p>Our approach to system development is to carry out short tests or trials, 

        where minor system refinements can be made, in between each major developmental 

        step. The first of these was carried out in two rooms in UCL when we had 

        established an initial but rough communication between the wearable system 

        and the VR system, i.e. between Vee and Anna. We have just begun a second 

        trial in the Lighthouse, with the system supporting three&#150;way communication 

        between Vee, Anna and Dub.</p>

      <p>In the UCL trial, we invited colleagues external to the City project 

        to take on the roles of Vee and Anna, so that we might gain initial observations 

        of interaction between a visitor in a virtual environment and a visitor 

        with a handheld device in a physical environment. We videotaped the room 

        where Vee was, and the VR as seen by Anna. We used a smaller version of 

        the Mack Room and a number of objects related to Mackintosh, such as posters 

        and postcards. This trial took place in UCL, rather than the Lighthouse, 

        to let us experiment with an immersive VR display and to use UCL&#146;s 

        infrastructure for recording activity in a virtual environment. One of 

        the participants also wrote a lengthy feedback document after the event 

        (Stenton, 2001). </p>

      <p>In general, the participants felt that being in different geographical 

        spaces did not make mutual awareness problematic. They extensively used 

        the audio connection during the trial, especially when there were issues 

        of shared reference to resolve. With limited facilities for sharing body 

        orientation, they often spoke to each other to confirm or question exactly 

        what they were facing and what they were referring to. Participants&#146; 

        engagement in the shared experience was shown by their use of vocabulary 

        and body movements used in their everyday physical interactions, and by 

        their awareness of each other&#146;s relative positions. Two instances 

        of the latter involved the participant Phil (as Vee) who felt that he 

        was in the way of Bill (Anna), and stepped back to free the view:</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">P: Can you read this poster on the wall? </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">B: Where? Which one are you looking at? That one&#133;  

      </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">P: Oh, I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m in the way mate. Can 

        you read it now? Can you read the Willow Tearooms?</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">[&#133;]</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">B: &#133;interferes with the wall. I believe I am 

        too close to the physical wall.   </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">P: Oh yeah &#150; I&#146;ll go out of the way.&nbsp; 

        There you go.&nbsp;Don&#146;t go through the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">B: That&#146;s the Willow Tearooms again. </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">P: Ah, the Willow Tearooms&#133; Sorry, you must be 

        standing on my foot then </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">B: I believe I&#146;m sitting inside you. Yes. Its&#146; 

        rather&#133; </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">P: Oh&#133; inside me &#150; what a thought! </p>

      <p>The video footage revealed that in the first of these cases, Phil was 

        not quite in Bill&#146;s way. However, Phil&#146;s concern and motion 

        to avoid blocking Bill&#146;s view indicated a sense of shared experience 

        and presence, As Phil later wrote:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Clearly our dialogue was one of discovering the shared 

        experience rather than sharing the visit. A defining moment for me was 

        the request from my virtual partner, &#147;Get out of the way; I can't 

        see the poster.&#148; At this point it felt like we were in the same room 

        rather than sharing information about two identical rooms in different 

        places (Stenton). </p>

      <p>With regard to the participants&#146; use of the handheld and the VR 

        equipment respectively, we observed a separate set of issues. One of the 

        common visitor gestures in a traditional museum setting is to point at 

        something. In the case of the VR, this is tracked and displayed;i.e. the 

        avatar has a head and a hand. We observed, however, that when using the 

        wearable and handheld, the visitor used his free hand to point at things. 

        This gesture went unnoticed by the system and consequently by his companion. 

        On the other hand, the digital visitor had great difficulty reading textual 

        information due to limited resolution in the virtual environment. Barbieri 

        and Paolini (2000) examined the same problem with regard to desktop VR 

        in the Virtual Leonardo project, and they used 2D graphics in the delivery 

        of textual information. We use the same solution in the desktop VR version 

        of our system, although we are also considering the use of a second handheld 

        device to display textual information to the VR visitor, Anna.</p>

      <p>Field trials inside The Lighthouse are, at the time of writing, still 

        in progress. The next section outlines this and other ongoing work.</p>

      <h2>Ongoing and Future work</h2>

      <p>So far we have discussed two parallel strands of our work. The studies 

        and system development have raised our awareness of social context issues, 

        and of the possibilities and the limits of our technology. While the studies 

        continue, the system work has subdivided into two strands. First, our 

        technological infrastructure is being refined and expanded to support 

        future systems where we support visitors moving between buildings and 

        exhibitions across the city, and where visitors can create associations 

        within a museum collection, between collections, and between collections 

        and the city. Those associations will form a resource for their later 

        visits, but also for the visits of others. </p>

      <p>Secondly, our current prototype system is being tailored and adapted 

        to suit the Mack Room and to take account of the results of our studies 

        and exploratory evaluations. Project members are now using the initial 

        prototype along with other departmental colleagues, Lighthouse staff and 

        a few members of the public. We consider it particularly important to 

        have the sociologist and museum studies experts in our project use the 

        system themselves. However, we are not yet undertaking formal or sustained 

        evaluation or observation. Instead, we make minor changes to the system 

        from day to day in the light of these informal short-term trials. This 

        has led to work on reducing the delay between a 'wearable' visitor moving 

        into a thematic zone and the automatic Web page display, refining the 

        position tracking, and changing the design of the pages shown on the handheld 

        so as to better combine map and content.</p>

      <p>In the course of these early and small design iterations, we improve 

        our understanding of the Room, its visitors and our technology. While 

        we have studied the Mack Room and its visitors before, and our system 

        before, the combination is new. We have many ideas that may be implemented 

        in the near future, such as more explicit support for the visitors acting 

        as guides, graphical representation of visitors' paths through the room, 

        and recommendation of people, places and artifacts. Still,we wish to leave 

        space for new ideas and priorities to grow from our ongoing evaluation 

        and observation. In pausing before a major redesign, we wish to secure 

        a balance between the studies of visitors, studies of visitors using our 

        system, technological interests in city&#150;wide use and adaptive information, 

        and theoretical work on notions of social context, interpretation and 

        media.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>Social context is an essential factor of the museum experience. Social 

        interaction with companion(s) and other members of the public directly 

        influences a museum experience. In the light of new technologies that 

        support remote access to museum settings, we can see that the social context 

        of the museum visit can extend beyond a physical room or building, and 

        include computer-mediated interactions. Similarly, museums can enrich 

        the digital site by better integrating it with the physical site. The 

        <i>City</i> project aims at both understanding and supporting social interaction 

        in cultural institutions; interaction that may be synchronous or asynchronous, 

        and that may involve multiple media such as mobile computers, hypermedia 

        and virtual environments. Our system supports interaction between physical 

        and digital visitors, as well as between visitors and their environments, 

        in a dynamic and contextual way. Our aim is a canvas of interaction that 

        spans different places, people and times, with a focus on the creation 

        and delivery of cultural information that is contextually appropriate, 

        useful and engaging. </p>
