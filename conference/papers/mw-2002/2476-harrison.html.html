      <p class=AbstractTitle><b>Abstract</b></p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The acceleration in the use of the Internet as a platform 

        for the production, showcasing and archiving of Digital Art is now evidenced 

        by the number of sites out there. This developing art form, generated 

        by rapid advances in new media and digital technology, provides a challenge 

        to the researcher studying the field.  In particular there are issues 

        for both curator and practitioner concerning temporality, aesthetics, 

        audience and exhibition.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Through the AHRB funded 'Digital Arts Curation and 

        Practice' project, virtual exhibitions have been curated at the Digital 

        Cafe of the<a href="../http://www.watershed.co.uk/" target="_blank"> Watershed 

        Media Centre</a>, Bristol, which have confirmed the Internet as a successful 

        medium for both presenting new works and archiving curated on-line exhibitions.  

        In particular the Net_Working on-line exhibition, 20-29 November 2001, 

        highlighted the problems of curating such works on a large scale.  </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Net_Working was an exhibition of Web works by national 

        and international artists available to view online @ <span class="normal"><a href="../http://www.dshed.net/networking" target="_blank">http://www.dshed.net/networking</a></span> 

        and on the large screen in the Digital Cafe at the media centre. The exhibition 

        showed over 300 Web works covering all forms of artistic practice on the 

        Web with submissions coming from places as far flung as Latvia, Thailand, 

        Brazil and California.  This exhibition was presented at the CHArt annual 

        conference at the British Academy, UK, 28 November 2001, and was further 

        discussed in interviews with contributing artists from the South West 

        UK region, through on-line chat arenas and through live link-up between 

        exhibiting artists and delegates at the 4th International Conference of 

        Modern Technology and Processes for Art, Media and Design in Bangkok, 

        28 November 2001.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Net_Working has facilitated the opportunity for researchers 

        to fully interrogate the Internet as a live archive of activity in the 

        digital arts. This paper concerns the organization, categorization, presentation, 

        evaluation and analysis involved in the curation of  'Net-Working' from 

        selection criteria to methods of presentation. There is  particular focus 

        on the diversity of work apparent in this global exhibition. The paper 

        will further discuss curatorial projects that have developed from this 

        event, the problems of archiving and accessing involved, and how the media 

        centre itself has developed new strategies for the presentation and introduction 

        of on-line work to its visitors. These are all examples contributing to 

        our understanding of changes taking place in the curation and practice 

        of Digital Art.</p>

      <h1><b>Introduction:</b></h1>

      <p class="BlockQuote">It is the capacity of the electronic computer to encode 

        a vast variety of information digitally that has given it such a central 

        place within contemporary culture...artists love making and playing with 

        the materials of culture, it was only a matter of time before they got 

        their hands on the computer. <br>

        <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Peter Lunenfeld, in Lunenfeld, 2000)</span></p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Museums, galleries and media centres have long been 

        aware of the cultural investment apparent in putting their exhibitions 

        online.  Artists realize that a URL for their work is accessible to 20 

        million people worldwide on the Web where space and time are collapsed, 

        permitting interactive multimedia pieces to travel across thousands of 

        miles and through international time-zones in seconds (or at least minutes).  

        With 40 million people keyed into the Internet, they can expect a huge 

        audience with more exposure than any traditional gallery can offer unless 

        they also provide an Internet platform.  Such a platform is not only for 

        showcasing artifacts and objects '<i>on</i>' the net , but also for bringing 

        curated virtual exhibitions of works created '<i>in</i>' the net to a 

        public space.  The Internet is where artists are using a new medium as 

        an integral part of their practice, and curators are being challenged 

        to support and facilitate this. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText><span class="normal">The Digital Media Research Centre 

        (DMRC) at the University of the West of England, Bristol, has been active 

        in researching this aspect of digital art curation and practice through 

        a 2-year project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB).  

        An established working partnership with the Watershed Media Centre (<a href="../http://www.watershed.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.watershed.co.uk</a>).  

        Bristol has provided this research with an arena for promoting and evaluating 

        new media events, work-in-progress, and on-line exhibitions.  The Watershed 

        began as a centre for showing film, video installations and photographic 

        exhibitions and has now expanded into non-linear media and on-line work.  

        In November, 2000, the Digital Café was created as a physical space for 

        showing interactive multimedia on a large screen together with 6 Apple 

        Mac computers in an informal setting.  This new space has enabled artists 

        and curators to enter into a direct dialogue with the public, which has 

        informed the analysis and evaluation of the working processes involved 

        in new media.  Research findings were then fed back to the Watershed and 

        the Digital Café space altered accordingly to better fit both audience 

        needs and working practice, where the focus is now on process rather than 

        outcomes and exhibition.  An example of this cause and effect development 

        is the Clark's Bursary for Digital Art.</span></p>

      <h2>Clark Bursary for Digital Art</h2>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The DMRC has been closely involved with the development 

        of the Clark's Bursary for Digital Art since its inception in 1997 and 

        has observed and documented the process, feeding the analysis and research 

        outcomes back to the Watershed for implementation.  The bursary was formed 

        with the aim of providing the opportunity for creative development in 

        the production of new work in digital media; it is open nationally in 

        the UK, but proposed projects should have relevance to the South West  

        region and be socially resonant.  The bursary is now entering its fourth 

        year and is currently in the process of supporting four smaller projects 

        which are to be undertaken throughout 2002 -2003.  A full report can be 

        read on <a

href="../http://www.media.uwe.ac.uk/dml_frameset1.html" target="_blank">http://www.media.uwe.ac.uk/dml_frameset1.html</a></p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>It has become evident over the researched span of the 

        bursary to date that the emphasis for the creation and support of digital 

        art has shifted from the production of outcomes and artifacts to research 

        and development.  The intent of the bursary is to further the artist/s 

        own practice, perhaps expanding into new media for the first time, and 

        it is now understood that this may result in an event, or series of events, 

        instead of the creation of an art object.  The Digital Café is a platform 

        for these artists to engage the interest of the public and show their 

        work in progress.  They are also encouraged to run workshops and seminars 

        to expand interest and help their new audience to 'read' digital art while 

        promoting and enriching their own work. The Watershed now provides both 

        a 'lab culture'of technical support and, through the Digital Café, audience/user 

        feedback in the creative process.  Thus it continues to develop its production 

        and screening facilities to offer the artist dynamic user feedback and 

        to offer the audience the chance to witness and contribute to the creative 

        process. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The working method of  'lab' culture is now evident 

        in many media centres and organizations where technicians work with artists 

        to produce new work; however it is becoming evident that the most fruitful 

        combination is where the technicians are artists in their own right and 

        act as collaborators or co-authors rather than dispassionate programmers.  

        Centres of good practice which can be exampled here are <a href="../http://www.pva.org.uk/" target="_blank">PVA 

        Org</a> in Dorset and <a href="../http://www.timebase.org/" target="_blank">Hull 

        Time-Based Arts</a>.</p>

      <h2 class=MsoPlainText><b>On-line Exhibitions</b><b></b></h2>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The Digital Café has now been established as a main 

        arena in the UK for showing on-line work.  This work is mainly that of 

        the artists working on-site and the work collated through the curated 

        international online exhibitions.  The first of these exhibitions was 

        the 'Exchange Online' exhibition, 20 - 28 November 2000, curated by a 

        DMRC research fellow to accompany the 'Exchange 2000' conference on research 

        in art, media and design, 2 - 3 November 2000.  This virtual gallery of 

        on-line work was the first large screening of on-line digital art work 

        held at the Digital Café.  It was a small scale exhibition of 12 Web sites 

        selected from 18 international submissions, a response to the 'call' for 

        art work sent over the Web and by e-mail. There was the required selection 

        panel of appropriate referees and a set of 5 selection criteria from which 

        work was graded from 1 &#150; 5.   The final number of choices was substantial, 

        but small enough to be archived on 1 CD-ROM.  All the work could be viewed 

        in one long, sitting equivalent to an afternoon spent viewing a conventional 

        art gallery exhibition,  and the single front screen of 12  text URL choices 

        did not tax the viewer too severely. Please see <a

href="../http://www.media.uwe.ac.uk/exchange2000/exhibition/" target="_blank">http://www.media.uwe.ac.uk/exchange2000/exhibition/</a></p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>One year later the process was repeated in order to 

        curate an on-line exhibition - 'Net_Working' - again at the Watershed's 

        Digital Café to accompany the CHArt 2000 conference held at the British 

        Academy (<a href="../http://www.dshed.net/networking" target="_blank">http://www.dshed.net/networking</a>).  

        It is the difference in the curation methods and processes undertaken 

        for each of these two exhibitions, determined by their variance in scale 

        and range of practice, which will now be discussed.  It is intended that 

        this comparison will indicate the challenge curators face when dealing 

        with on-line work and will highlight the steep growth in the number of 

        artists engaging with the Internet as a new media for their practice.   

        The organization, categorization and presentation undertaken for Net_Working 

        is still in the process of analysis and evaluation.  Net_Working is now 

        seen as an archive for further investigation.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Within a week of putting out the 'call' for work on 

        25<sup>th</sup> September across the Web, there were over 150 submissions 

        The 'call' went out to media centres, artist organisations, networks and 

        individuals.  The most lucrative places reaching the most artists are:  

        Rhizome.org which has an international following, Turbulence which covers 

        USA and Canada and Rezone which serves Eastern Europe, however all those 

        contacted have mailing lists and websites with a global audience..  By 

        the deadline of 12th November, there were well over 300.  There are four 

        possible reasons for this escalation in submissions of Web works for an 

        online exhibition:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Further research within the year 

          between the 'Exchange Online' and 'Net_Working' exhibitions had targeted 

          the main Web sites where artists browse for announcing the 'call'</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The announcement was timely, late 

          September, post the summer break when people are eager to begin work 

          again;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The exhibition title and theme 

          was phrased well-enough to engage interest;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">There has been a surge of net 

          activity by artists within the last year.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>A combination of all of the above is most likely although 

        the greater weight must lie in the latter two.  It is evident that there 

        has been an acceleration of artists using new media within their practice 

        and the Internet can now support most elements of new media e.g. video, 

        animation, sound, text, image manipulation, communication and artificial 

        life forms.  Engaging interest without being over deterministic is difficult, 

        the theme needed to be open, flexible, slightly ambiguous and intriguing 

        enough to catch a diversity of practice.  The final call for work was 

        as follows:</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;* *  Net_Working  * *</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Online but non-linear meshed and inter-linked net works 

        for the Net. Collaborated clusters of single entities, caught in the Web 

        where medium is content.</p>

      <p class="Blockquote"><span class="normal">Trawling for content with Net 

        works which are: collaborative, co-operative, interlinked, conversational, 

        human, supportive, interdependent, organic, inclusive, expansive, joining, 

        connecting, uniting, enriching...&quot;</span></p>

      <h2>The surge in Net Art</h2>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The term 'Net-art' is difficult and damning in that 

        it implies a flash aesthetic where style rules over content and all viewers 

        have an attention span of 5 seconds; it still suffers from the stigma 

        of nineties 'eye-candy'.   However, technological advances in hard and 

        software, plug-ins and downloads have enabled the net to support a wide 

        range of forms of art practice from video documentaries to artificial 

        life.  'Net-art' is now too narrow a term to encompass the diversity of 

        art forms apparent on the Internet.  Electronic Art Festivals such as 

        ISEA and Ars Electronica have included on-line Net-art within their remit 

        from its beginnings, and electronic art has an established place in 20th 

        Century art practice.  Popper, in his book Art of the Electronic Age   

        (1993) traces this form of art practice from the Industrial Revolution 

        and its influence on technical innovation, for example - William Morris 

        and the Arts and Crafts Movement - through Futurism, Dadaism, Constructivism, 

        Marcel Duchamp, Kinetics and Cybernetic art to the present.  He then states 

        7 sources from which contemporary technological art has drawn its inspiration:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Photography and Cinematography</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Conceptual Art and Land Art</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Light Art</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Kinetic Art</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Calculated and programmed art</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Cybernetic Art</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Electronic  Art</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Out of these perhaps Conceptual art sounds out of place, 

        with no direct connection to electronics and therefore computers, but 

        with its intellectual and information aspects it could be aligned with 

        the understanding of the computer as augmenting human intellect.  Here 

        a line can be traced back to Duchamp and his promotion of idea over visual 

        aesthetic.  Christine Tamblyn, 1990, argues in her paper 'Computer Art 

        as Conceptual Art'  that computers were designed to augment mental processes 

        as opposed to being visual or manual aids and that using the computer 

        as a drawing tool limited its capabilities when compared to the postmodern 

        attitude represented by artists extending  the purview of conceptual art.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The html coding which builds the Internet sites and 

        interlinks those sites into a global communication network has developed 

        from an initial idea in the 1930s.  The vision of Vannevar Bush, stated 

        in his article 'As We May Think' in 1945 (Bush, 1945) was of the 'Memex' 

        machine. This was to be an analogue machine built of cumbersome valves, 

        levers and photocells.   It would have taken the form of a glass box , 

        a desk with a desktop of images, texts and other notes contained within 

        and shown on request as an aid to supplement the memory of writers and 

        researchers. Memex was to be a machine performing information retrieval 

        by association (in hypertext, a link).  It was to process selection by 

        association rather than by indexing.  Bush based this idea on his understanding 

        that the human mind was not confined by the classification and categorization 

        of information archived in libraries etc., but worked in a different way 

        and could be emulated mechanically to produce a useful tool - his 'Memex' 

        machine.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>The human mind does not work that way but by association.  

        With one fact or idea &#145;in its grasp&#146; the mind snaps instantly 

        to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts in accordance 

        with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.  

        <br>

        <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Bush, 23)  </span>    </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Bush proposed the notion of blocks of text joined by 

        links, and used terms such as 'links', 'trails', and 'web'.  His ideas 

        influenced Douglas Engelbart who produced the 'Augment' system with the 

        intention of amplifying human intellect, networked machines and the mouse.  

        He also influenced Ted Nelson who coined the term 'hypertext'.  These 

        pioneers together with Tim Berners-Lee and his World Wide Web programme 

        of HTML in 1991 have given us a new medium for contemporary conceptual 

        art work.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The Internet, a sub-heading to Electronic Art, can 

        be understood as just another tool that artists can use or as a medium 

        integral to their particular thinking and practice. As technology has 

        advanced to the point where the Web can support most forms of new media 

        and contemporary art practice including all of Popper's sources listed 

        above, the current surge in Internet work begins to make sense. </p>

      <h2><b>Curation and online exhibition</b></h2>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The wealth of submitted work for the Net_Working exhibition 

        changed the curation methods applied previously for smaller on-line exhibitions 

        such as the Exchange 2000 Online Exhibition.  These methods had been adapted 

        from curation in the traditional terrestrial galleries where a panel of 

        'experts' would apply a set of selection criteria to the submitted works.  

        For example, the selection criteria for the Exchange 2000 show was</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Visual aesthetic;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Depth of content;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Level of Engagement;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Originality;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Extent of furthering research/practice;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Ease of access and functionality. 

          </span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>For an exhibition on the scale of over 300 works, any 

        selection criteria would have had to narrow down the choices to the point 

        of negating perfectly good pieces of work in different forms, whereas 

        an open submission based on the theme would sustain the diversity of new 

        media practice now apparent on the Internet.  Having made a decision in 

        favour of open submissions, the exhibition organizers (a team of five 

        consisting of two UWE researchers, the Watershed events organiser, a new 

        media artist and a Digital Café technician) then faced the challenge of 

        how the exhibition was to be viewed.  How do you present 300 pieces of 

        work on one monitor screen?  Few Net-artists are well known in the art 

        world, with the possible exceptions of JODI, Mongrel, Craighead and Atkinson 

        and a handful of others.  They are not so 'personality' driven as artists 

        using more traditional media, preferring instead the anonymity of the 

        Web and the temporary, ephemeral status of work on the net.  (Although 

        this is beginning to change as Web art gains more of a foothold in the 

        art scene).  Therefore searching by name would not be sufficient.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>We approached this problem by investigating the nature 

        of on-line art, concluding that: </p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Work on the Web is often intended 

          to be short-lived and not realized as a piece to be permanently on show 

          in a gallery or collection.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Time on a server may be limited.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Dynamic, generative work is difficult 

          or impossible to archive if it only exists in a live state.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Interactive work requires a viewer 

          to interact with, in order for it to exist in its live state.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A work only exists when the computer 

          is turned on: if the URL is not well known or promoted, the work will 

          not be seen.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Downloads and plug-ins are often 

          required to experience the work fully.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">From previous events it was evident 

          that our exhibition viewer would be interested in</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The type of work, whether documentary 

          or animation etc., </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Where it originated from, country, 

          culture etc., is important</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Who created it, an individual, 

          organization, team of specialists etc., must be clear</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">What the piece is about, content, 

          narrative etc. is significant </span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The exhibition team of five organizers then took sixty 

        sites each and proceeded to explore the options for accessing numerous 

        Internet sites from the interface of a single screen, considering the 

        above points. The team was to check each site for functionality, speed 

        and ease of access, viewing time and pace of engagement.  They also took 

        note of the content and form of the work on show.  These observations 

        would both assist the interface design for the exhibition and feed further 

        research into the challenge of on-line curating.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>They agreed that providing the viewer with many methods 

        of accessing the work presented was preferable to offering only one, and 

        the exhibition can now be accessed through several choices:category; image; 

        content; artist's name; title of piece and country of origin.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Collating this very specific information meant opening 

        a dialogue with 150 artists in order to obtain the following within the 

        time limit of one week:</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Title of work; name of artist/s involved; country of 

        origin; 200 word statement; descriptive sentence and a 100 pixel square 

        72 dpi jpeg image.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The artists were also asked to declare a category for 

        their work.  It was necessary here to explain that this was clearly for 

        reasons of navigation and not for 'labeling' purposes.  Where argument 

        was expected, there was only support.  Artists engaged with the Internet 

        as exhibition platform understand well the difficulties of interface and 

        access.  The artists were offered a list of possible categories to select 

        from and of course were able to extend this to more aptly 'catch' their 

        work:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>text/poetry; game; web narrative; documentary; film/video; 

        sound; hacktivism; gallery; other. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Further categories have been added of </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>portfolio; organization; log/journal and multi-user 

        domains.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Many chose the 'other' category; this may require further 

        definition and discussion.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>What we were in fact building was a database.  We were 

        designing a retrieval interface screen for an information collection stored 

        electronically.  Lev Manovich asserts in his paper 'Database as a Symbolic 

        Form', 1998, that all Web site designers are actually designing databases.  

      </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>The rise of the Web, this gigantic and always changing 

        data corpus, gave millions of people a new hobby or profession: data indexing.  

        There is hardly a Web site which does not feature at least a dozen links 

        to other sites, therefore every site is a type of database.           

      </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>A database is a form of archive, but the Internet cannot 

        offer digital preservation for long,. Servers go down, software and hardware 

        platforms change, but the most difficult obstacle here concerns the nature 

        of the database content.  Many artists choose the medium of the Internet 

        for their work because of the temporality and ephemerality and ambiguity 

        involved.  They prefer not to be categorized and classified; their sites 

        are restricted to a life-span which they have set and which is integral 

        to the work.  The work is a patch of generative algorithms which are triggered 

        by the viewer logging on and are only alive when interaction takes place.  

        Any art database/online exhibition held on the Internet has to remain 

        dynamic and open to change through the very nature of the content it contains.  

        All curators can do is to gather clusters of sites/work together into 

        a database for a space of time.  The back-up archive for Net_Working is 

        in process now.  Over 300 CD-ROMs have been sent out to the relevant artists 

        with the hope that they will be able to return them with their work on 

        and functioning.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The timespan of one week in which to build the site 

        was (predictably) unrealistic, and artists continue to submit information.  

        During the 10-day large screening of the exhibition at the Digital Café, 

        work was constantly put on-line as the support material came in.  E-mail 

        was the fast, direct communication channel between artists, the curation 

        team, and interested parties.  The dialogue begun in this format was extended 

        to a live chat arena on the Web.  This event was to exist between 7.00 

        - 9.00pm on 26 November 2001; in effect the public forum continued throughout 

        that night, allowing for different time-zones and the obvious need for 

        artists to communicate about their evolving form of practice.  The archive 

        from this will feed further research into on-line curation.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Other events organized to enable artists to contribute 

        to the discourse concerning practice in new media were:</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>An opening event of presentations and discussion on 

        20 November 2001 to which there was a good turnout of the local artists 

        involved in Net_Working.  This was well attended by the public and again 

        was archived for future research;</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>A live link-up between delegates from the 4th International 

        Conference on Modern Technology and Processes in Art, Media and Design 

        held in Bangkok and a contingent of Net_Working artists at the Watershed,  

        28 November 2001, 10.00 -11.30am (Bristol)/4.00 - 5.30pm (Bangkok).</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>These two events, together with the opening evening 

        and the presentation of this paper at the CHArt annual conference, has 

        brought the 10-day exhibition much attention and it is envisaged that 

        further focus on Net_Working will be given through a series of smaller 

        exhibitions relating to the separate categories identified here.  It is 

        crucial that all the submitted work is seen and appreciated as a significant 

        array of the range and diversity of digital art practice, and if this 

        is achieved, it will be inevitable that this exhibition will be understood 

        as a curated database of the living, dynamic archive that is the Internet.  

        It is hoped that Net_Working will provide researchers with a fruitful 

        case study for further research into both curation and practice in the 

        field of digital art and new media. </p>
