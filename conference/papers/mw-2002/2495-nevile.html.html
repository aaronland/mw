        <p class=AbstractText>People with disabilities are slowly finding their

          all users.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>After a number of years, the communities of people 

          with disabilities are slowly finding their way on to the Web, up the 

          virtual ramp, as it were. The ramp that is being used is, as in many 

          other contexts, popular among many users beyond the community for whom 

          it was first requested. Good practice has ramps integrated into the 

          design of institutions from the start, and everyone can feel equally 

          welcome and share in the experiences provided beyond the ramp.</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>The authors have been working with a community responsible 

          for a 'museum' that covers several hundred square miles. It contains 

          a collection of 100,000 Quinkan Aboriginal cave paintings and is located 

          in the far north of Queensland in Australia. In this context, the idea 

          of an equivalent experience for those who visit on the Web is of paramount 

          interest. In fact, almost everyone who visits and experiences Quinkan 

          culture and artifacts will be doing so via the Web. Almost all of the 

          'museum' is inaccessible (the nearest city is 250 miles away) for one 

          reason or another. Currently, work is being undertaken to develop an 

          interpretive centre for this museum and the on-line component of that 

          is of interest here. (See the Queensland Heritage Trails Web site, <a

href="../http://www.heritagetrails.qld.gov.au/fs_quinkan.html" target="_blank">http://www.heritagetrails.qld.gov.au/fs_quinkan.html</a>) 

        </p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>Virtual tours of Quinkan country will be designed 

          to attract visitors to the real thing, but only a small proportion of 

          visitors will make the journey. The virtual tour will provide the first 

          level of equivalence; the virtual experience for those who cannot have 

          the real experience. The second level of equivalence comes in when the 

          first experience is transformed for the benefit of those who, for whatever 

          reason, do not get access to the first level.</p>

        <p class=MsoBodyText>'Equivalence' in the accessibility context means 

          that a user who avoids one presentation of a resource, for one reason 

          or another, can choose an alternative resource to gain an 'equivalent' 

          experience. It is an open question what is equivalent to the range of 

          resources and activities being developed for what is seen as a museum's 

          target audience.So questions for consideration when developing virtual 

          exhibitions of the Quinkan Rock Art include:</p>

      </div>

      <ul>

        <li>What is equivalent to being shown a 36,000 year old cave painting 

          by an elder of a community that has lived in the region for tens of 

          thousands of years?, and</li>

        <li> 

          <div class=Section1> What is the equivalent of the experience for those 

            who either cannot see, or cannot hear the primary virtual experience?</div>

        </li>

      </ul>

      <div class=Section1> 

        <p class=MsoBodyText>For a starting point, the authors present a brief 

          overview of the technology available for accessibility. Then they explore 

          some different approaches to providing access, through the perspective 

          of IMS (<a

href="../http://www.imsproject.org/" target="_blank">http://www.imsproject.org/</a>). They further 

          develop these ideas with particular reference to their similarity with 

          current museum practice, and consider the implications for accessibility. 

          Finally they recommend that museum exhibitors and authors, developing 

          interactive or electronic resources, include planning for accessibility 

          as part of their initial design process.</p>

        <h1>The Technology of Access</h1>

        <p class=MsoNormal>The ramp in the online context is what is defined as 

          universally accessible Web content, according to the W3C Web Content 

          Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="../http://www.w3.org/WAI/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/WAI/</a>). 

          An effective ramp exists, according to the W3C Web Content Accessibility 

          Initiative working groups' recommendations, when Web content is equally 

          available to all accessibility-standards-compliant devices, whether 

          they are GUI browsers, have mouseless interfaces, or are Braille devices. 

          The guidelines relate to content, authoring tools and access devices 

          and agents.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>In the case of a virtual museum, or the online publication 

          and interactions of a museum, such ramps are now required by law in 

          many countries. Currently there is work going on to implement the accessibility 

          requirements but some of this work is not merely technical, and this 

          is especially of interest in the museum context. Generally, the familiar 

          question that is now well-integrated into thinking in the physical world, 

          &quot;How can experiences be provided by museums in ways that provide 

          equal satisfaction for all&quot; is extended to ask, &quot;How can virtual 

          experiences be provided by museums in ways that cater for all needs, 

          including for those who could never enter a physical museum?&quot;</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, derived 

          from consultation and consensus among the many and varied disabilities 

          communities, and content and technology developers, call for the provision 

          of equivalent alternative resources and activities for those who cannot 

          use the initial presentation, be it an interactive multimedia object, 

          a video, or just a picture. In this paper, we start to formulate ways 

          of thinking about what this may mean for the design of online experiences.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>A video file can have multiple tracks, each catering 

          for modalities that suit different needs. Sometimes such a composite 

          object can be constructed as a unit, with software that handles all 

          the modalities, and on other occasions it needs to be formed by the 

          close association of the sub-objects. It can even be a combination of 

          sub-elements from different sources, as happens when, post-publication 

          of the primary objects, someone else publishes an alternative transformed 

          version, say a caption file that relates to the original resource. Integration 

          of all these files, including the capability to vary the speed with 

          which interactions happen, can be organized by a single integrating 

          language. SMIL (pronounced 'smile' and meaning Synchronised Multimedia 

          Integration Language), (<a

href="../http://www.w3.org/SMIL/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/SMIL/</a>) is the recommended 

          XML (<a href="../http://www.w3.org/XML/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/XML/</a>) language 

          that can perform this function (<a href="../http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/</a>).</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Composite objects can be combined in the usual way 

          as Web pages before being published to the Web . In fact, in new work 

          on theories of how authors can learn to create Web resources, the authors 

          have worked with the metaphor of a newspaper. The Web author, according 

          to this theory, is encouraged to develop atomic Web content, aggregate 

          it as accessible composite objects, and then to lay them out on a Web 

          page, to create the Web resource. </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>An important technology that has made this an appropriate 

          practice is the development of Cascading StyleSheets (<a

href="../http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/</a>). Using these, 

          and separating the content from its layout is the first step. The content, 

          apart from being composed of objects that are themselves accessible 

          (because they consist of a range of sub-objects that themselves cater 

          for a range of needs), needs to be carefully classified or structured. 

          HTML (now deprecated in favor of XHTML) and other XML markup languages 

          can be used to tag objects within the resource so that navigation elements, 

          headings, sub-headings, addresses, etc can be easily picked up by access 

          devices and presented in ways that make them easily identifiable, as 

          they are for those of us who can see them on a web page. CSS is then 

          used to format these objects in ways that make them most useable according 

          to the particular access device being employed. The style sheets 'cascade' 

          in order to allow for a set of them, including a user preferred one, 

          and it is possible for the user to change the layout or presentation 

          by changing the style sheet. In other words, while a GUI device such 

          as a standard browser might use a style sheet that has tags describing 

          how the text, images, links should appear on a screen, a screen-reading 

          device may override the given style sheet and use one that applies different 

          voices as it reads out the differently structured objects.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>With the developments made possible by XML, style sheets 

          can themselves be transformed, not just alternated, and there is considerable 

          scope for good devices to make objects and thus resources much more 

          meaningful and useable according to the needs and devices of the user. 

          It is in this context that the authors have been working on their newspaper 

          metaphor for developing accessible resources.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Like a modern museum, the Web is not a static experience 

          of receiving information, but an interactive dynamic space for exploration. 

          Work on ensuring the accessibility of new Web technologies such as Scalable 

          Vector Graphics (<a href="../http://www.w3.org/SVG/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/SVG/</a>), 

          a way of presenting dynamic animated graphic material in textual form 

          so it can be rendered as images or text, SMIL (as mentioned above) and 

          new interactive building blocks for the Web, is critical for the provision 

          of accessibility. This work forms the base for the virtual ramps. </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Where multiple transformations of the same resource 

          are authored by the resource creator, and available to users regardless 

          of their special needs, or access abilities, the creator of the resources 

          is able to communicate directly with the user. Psychologically, as with 

          the ramp into the building, the user has the sense of inclusion and 

          an equal opportunity to participate. The technologies mentioned so far 

          can be used to make available, in appropriate formats and modalities, 

          what has been selected and created by the original resource creator. 

          The point here is that it is not a matter of a creator producing one 

          resource and leaving it to technicians to make alternatives for those 

          with special needs, but rather a situation where the original creator 

          should be encouraged to think <i>ab initio</i> of all the different 

          formats and modalities and consider their design part of the main design 

          process.</p>

        <h1>Direct and Compatible Access</h1>

        <p class=MsoNormal>There are two major forms of physical access to online 

          resources (<a href="../http://www.imsproject.org/accessibility/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.imsproject.org/accessibility/index.html</a>)</p>

        <p class=BlockQuote>&quot;A &quot;directly accessible&quot; product is 

          designed so that a person with a disability can operate all on-screen 

          controls and access the content without relying on the aid of an AT 

          [assistive technology]. For example, to be accessible to users with 

          low-vision, directly accessible applications, software, or Web sites 

          offer features to enlarge all controls and on-screen text and are designed 

          with high contrast colors or provide features that allow users to choose 

          appropriate colors. To be accessible to blind users, a directly accessible 

          product should have a keyboard interface with audio output.&quot;</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>A directly accessible Web resource, with a suitable 

          keyboard interface will provide access for many users who are blind, 

          those with physical disabilities and many others who have a temporary 

          disability. Audio output that announces the presence and status of on-screen 

          controls and conveys the atmosphere of the application, software, or 

          Web site assists those with vision disabilities but also the illiterate 

          and the foreign language speakers. A single key method for scanning 

          through choices in the application or software provides access for users 

          dependent on a single switch for input or who are busy using their hands 

          for some other purpose (e.g. knitting or driving).</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>A &quot;compatibly accessible&quot; application, software, 

          or Web site is designed with AT in mind. This level of access assumes 

          the user has a preferred AT package installed and is relatively competent 

          and comfortable with it. A compatibly accessible product is designed 

          with &quot;hooks&quot; to facilitate ease of use with a screen reader, 

          screen magnifier, or alternative input devices such as adapted keyboards 

          or single switches. These hooks can be implemented by developers . &#147;... 

          Exposing the system cursor, using standard controls and fonts, and following 

          the operating system's human interface guidelines can help make a product 

          compatibly accessible.&#148;</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Direct and compatible access offers different advantages 

          to different stakeholders in the Web context.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Directly accessible on-line resources have as advantages:</p>

      </div>

      <ul>

        <li>no requirement for expensive assistive technologies, cutting costs</li>

        <li> 

          <div class=Section1> reduction of technical complexity</div>

        </li>

        <li>the opportunity for users to operate any computers anywhere</li>

        <li> 

          <div class=Section1> direct and designed communication between the creative 

            author and the user, not an AT acting as intermediary, and </div>

        </li>

        <li>single resources that are suitable for a range of special needs (one 

          size fits all).</li>

      </ul>

      <div class=Section1>Compatibly accessible on-line resources offer:</div>

      <ul>

        <li> 

          <div class=Section1> consistency of operation across different activities 

            for the user</div>

        </li>

        <li>lower content development costs</li>

        <li>system-based functionality e.g. an AT package provides text-to-speech 

          capability</li>

        <li>possibly the only access means for some users e.g. Braille, anda single 

          set of programming techniques to be used by the developer for all ATs.</li>

      </ul>

      <div class=Section1> 

        <p class=MsoBodyText>Directly compatible resources allow all users to 

          engage with them 'equally' in the same sense as the ramp into the museum 

          building gives access to all. The experience may be different, because 

          the ability to participate may be different, but everyone has the opportunity 

          to participate in the same activity.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>The National Center for Accessible Media (<a href="../http://ncam.wgbh.org/" target="_blank">http://ncam.wgbh.org/</a>) 

          has developed a DVD that shows how this can be done with interactive 

          materials that have been made directly accessible for people with a 

          range of disabilities.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Direct access is available when users are provided 

          with transformations of content that suit their access devices.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Imagine an interactive multimedia product that offers 

          a virtual tour of a small area containing some significant rock art 

          paintings in northern Australia. Such a multimedia product would probably 

          contain, in various combinations, text, images, animations, video, sound 

          files, and interactive applications.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Blind persons will not be able to see either the images 

          or the controls to interact with the resources. They will need keyboard 

          replacements for the mouse, for text that describes all images and imagery, 

          and Braille or voice transformations of all text, captions to accompany 

          sound files where these are initially accompanied by images or text, 

          and so on. Deaf persons will be grateful for images and video but possibly 

          not find text easy to read, and may need signing, and this may need 

          to be in their language (e.g. US, or UK standards). A person with cognitive 

          disabilities may need more literal text than others who are not confused 

          by metaphoric representations. Braille readers may need extra time in 

          which to make choices because their transformations are delivered more 

          slowly. And so on.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>All of these requirements can be accommodated simultaneously 

          by the creation of composite objects from which the user can choose 

          those required.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>An example of a situation when direct access might 

          not be preferred over compatible access is when users of a speech interface 

          are required to learn to use the speech interface associated with the 

          resource instead of being able to rely on their own, and operate with 

          familiar, but compatible access. For blind people who are using a computer 

          every day, it is important to have access to a number of different kinds 

          of software: e-mail, word processing, Web browsing, system tasks, and 

          so on. To deal with this, various systems are available to provide something 

          like an &quot;audio desktop&quot;,   as familiar to its users as other 

          people are with a visual desktop metaphor of windows placed like overlapping 

          pieces of paper on the screen. For such blind users, it is an interference 

          (sometimes quite literally, stopping their everyday software from working) 

          to have to learn a specially designed system for a unique task when 

          they are used to similar tasks using a familiar interface.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>If multiple modalities are available to increase the 

          range of opportunities for direct access, four classes of users may 

          benefit although they would not normally have sought such alternatives. 

          These include users who:</p>

      </div>

      <ul>

        <li>do not know of their 'disabilities'</li>

        <li>do not consider them worthy of concern</li>

        <li>

          <div class=Section1> do not know what to do about them or</div>

        </li>

        <li>do not know how to, or cannot afford to get assistance.</li>

      </ul>

      <div class=Section1>

        <p class=MsoNormal>In addition, as has been noted above, it is not always 

          possible to provide directly accessible transformations of all content 

          so that all users may participate directly. </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>If a range of resource sub-elements has been developed, 

          so that the users are free to choose among them, in many cases a user 

          with a compatible device will choose to use that in combination with 

          a directly accessible sub-element. In other words, direct access is 

          compatible with compatible access as well-designed direct access sub-elements 

          can be selected by all users, including those who may need to use ATs.</p>

        <h1>Alternative and Equivalent Access</h1>

        <p class=MsoNormal>In practice, however, it may be quite difficult to 

          provide all users with the same resource and achieve the same outcomes. 

          In this sense, it is not the technical difficulties associated with 

          the task but rather the potential to support, or destroy, the original 

          intention of the resource that may be in question. The problem of what 

          to provide for users is not new: in the museum context it has been dealt 

          with extensively as the problem of how to design a good exhibition. 

          An expression often used to describe the quality of good applications 

          that make them useful and learnable to the most users is &quot;low threshold 

          and high ceiling&quot;. This means that for users there is a minimal 

          entry level, in terms of technological expertise and domain understanding, 

          and yet the same application can work well for a highly accomplished 

          and knowledgeable person who has strong technical skills.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>In the virtual museum context, the question is what 

          will provide a virtual visitor with the richest experience, given that 

          some visitors have special needs. The solution may be one that offers 

          all users an equivalent experience, according to the modality in which 

          they participate. In other words, the provision of resources in multiple 

          modalities may not be sufficient to satisfy the original intention of 

          the resource when the full range of users is taken into account.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Returning to the IMS definitions, (IMS, 2001) we find:</p>

        <p class=BlockQuote>When considering the accessibility of applications 

          and software for learning, education, and training, it is important 

          to understand the differences between two types of access: equivalent 

          and alternative.</p>

        <p class=BlockQuote>Equivalent Access provides the learner with the same 

          learning activity but it is mediated in a different modality. Providing 

          a course textbook in Braille format, on audio tape, or in digital format 

          are examples of equivalent accessibility. Alternative Access provides 

          the learner with a different learning activity but one that is designed 

          to achieve the same learning objectives. An example of alternative accessibility 

          might be having a mobility-impaired student conduct science experiments 

          in a virtual laboratory, where the same levels of dexterity, strength, 

          and physical access are not required as in a physical laboratory.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>What is impressive, and often makes the production 

          of alternative activity worthwhile, is that what was primarily considered 

          as an alternative for people with disabilities, like the ramp, becomes 

          an attraction for an unanticipated community of people. A simple example 

          is provided by the &quot;virtual microscope&quot;, developed by the 

          Open University, UK (IMS, 2001) for disabled students but subsequently 

          used by all students because of its ability to achieve key learning 

          objectives more fully than the original exercise involving a real microscope.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>It is the cognitive aspect of accessibility that is 

          under consideration here. If the virtual museum experience is designed 

          to replace or be an alternative to a 'real' experience, it will be designed, 

          presumably, to achieve the same effect in the participant's mind. What 

          is not clear, and not answerable, is whether the alternative experience 

          is to provide equal access to the real experience or simply to the virtual 

          experience. Either way, and this will depend upon the circumstances, 

          this will not be easily solved.</p>

        <h1>Cognitive Equivalence</h1>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Many years ago, the authors both worked with computer 

          controlled robot 'turtles' - on screen and off. For a substantial time, 

          teachers saw the Logo 'turtle' as needing to be explained to children 

          in the real world (using a physical object) so they could make sense 

          of the virtual turtle - a triangle of pixels on the screen. In fact, 

          children had no trouble at all identifying with the 'turtle' triangle 

          and also relating to the physical (toy) turtle. There was nothing to 

          suggest that the children did not see these as two separate objects, 

          alternate, and in many ways equivalent, or that they needed to relate 

          to a real turtle in order to be able to relate to a moving image. This 

          thinking led one author through a series of investigations of screen 

          experiences, ultimately concluding that there was nothing 'virtual' 

          about screen objects. In some cases, the virtual object had characteristics 

          that were not possible for a physical object, and so could be used to 

          discover 'artificially', concepts that could not be accessed as easily 

          in the real world.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>The most effective use of this artificiality seemed 

          to occur when the virtual or simulated object was 'broken' in significant 

          respects. In the case of the turtle, the screen version did not have 

          to contend with gravity, and could assert its position in co-ordinates. 

          These two features alone made it a most suitable object for programming 

          in a gravity investigation exercise. In the process of attributing gravity 

          to the world of the turtle, children were able to discover important 

          facts about gravity such as that it exerted a constant downwards effect 

          on objects, and that this was not altered by the object's horizontal 

          motion although it changed the path of the object traveling horizontally. 

        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>There was 'reality' in the children's minds of equal 

          significance, no matter that it was inspired by a real (physical) or 

          virtual (electronic) object.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>If the aim of a museum exhibition is to provide visitors 

          with opportunities to use the exhibition to learn, become more knowledgeable, 

          or whatever it's called, it seems that there is the potential for alternative 

          activities, particularly when supported by computation, to achieve the 

          same goal as the physical exhibition. When considering what alternatives 

          to make available for users with special needs who are accessing a virtual 

          exhibition, the author has the task of deciding what is appropriate 

          to people who have access to only some modalities in which resources 

          can be provided. The authors consider this similar to the familiar task 

          of designing for work with different materials in the real world, and 

          that including the range of modalities extends, rather than alters, 

          the designer's work.</p>

        <h1>Creating Alternative Experiences</h1>

        <p class=MsoNormal>In the end, equivalence is something that is a matter 

          of judgment. The perceptions of authors about what they are trying to 

          convey, and the perceptions of readers (in the broad sense) of what 

          the authors were trying to convey, are not necessarily the same. An 

          equivalent or an alternative can be said to have been a &quot;good&quot; 

          one when readers who used different alternatives come away with the 

          same impressions of what they are being shown.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>This is a difficult but mostly soluble problem in a 

          training context where there are specific desired outcomes and measurable 

          descriptions of what the reader should be able to demonstrate having 

          accomplished. But in the more open-ended context of an educational experience, 

          or a museum experience, providing a resource that can be interpreted 

          in different ways is more complicated.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>A &quot;minimal equivalence&quot; might be achieved 

          if it is possible for some primary message to be received from any of 

          the available alternatives. For example, a short cartoon like the following 

          might be perceived as conveying the information that text without illustrations 

          does not communicate as well as illustrated text. On the other hand, 

          a &quot;more complete equivalence&quot; could convey something more. 

          In fact, any selection of an alternative will convey a style. Consider 

          the difference between:</p>

        <p class=BlockQuote>&quot;Supplement text with non-text content.&quot;</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>and</p>

        <p class=BlockQuote>&quot;Some people can't read writing easily, so add 

          images, sounds, movies and so on to help them understand your message.&quot;</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>and</p>

        <p class=BlockQuote>&quot;This is a cartoon. On the left is a person looking 

          in confusion at a poster of text. On the right the text has had images 

          added to explain it, and &quot;the light has dawned&quot; - the person 

          now understands the poster. The left hand panel has been crossed out 

          indicating it is not the right approach, and the right hand panel has 

          a tick indicating that it is a good approach.&quot;</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>and</p>

        <p class=MsoCaption><br>

          <img src="nevile_34a.gif" width="364" height="273"><br>

          Figure 1: a cartoon <a

href="../http://www.w3.org/2001/08/mmcmn/34a.png" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/2001/08/mmcmn/34a.png</a></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>In the work associated with development of artificial 

          environments for learning, the community often refers to such environments 

          as 'microworlds'. One quality of good microworlds is that they satisfy 

          the rule above of having a low threshold but nevertheless a high ceiling. 

          As well, they provide rich opportunities for a range of users without 

          necessarily being able to predict what users will bring to their interaction 

          with the microworld or gain from it. Microworlds usually give control 

          to the users, allowing them to choose what to do in the environment 

          with the designer knowing that whatever is done, it is very likely that 

          something of value will be gained. A physical equivalent of such a microworld 

          might be a sandpit with water for a child.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>But one feature of microworlds is outstanding. While 

          they are recognizable for these qualities once developed, it is often 

          not that they have been easy to create, or even that their designers 

          were able to apply a clear set of design practices in order to produce 

          them. Many years of experience with microworlds suggests they are somewhat 

          like other forms of art: not subject to prescription yet enormously 

          rewarding and valuable. The authors believe this to be similar to the 

          work of museum exhibition design, and feel confident that museums will 

          embrace accessibility and demonstrate their expertise in a slightly 

          more complex world with the usual high standards of success.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Having considered the tools with which museums might 

          work to build the virtual ramp, and the growing demonstration of talent 

          within museums to create on-line resources of all kinds, the authors 

          are optimistic that the museum community will be able to make a substantial 

          contribution to the more general effort to make the Web a rich, exciting 

          and educational environment for all.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>A young Aboriginal man recently spoke of his efforts 

          to make sure the rock path he was building up to a rock painting site 

          was appropriate for the site (Steffensen, 2000). We believe the ramps 

          that give access to virtual visits to the Quinkan Rock Art of far north 

          Australia can be just as inclusive and rewarding.</p>
