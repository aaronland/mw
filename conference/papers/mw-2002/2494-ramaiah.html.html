      <p class=PaperTitle>The Design and Development of an Online Exhibition for 

        Heritage Information Awareness</p>

      <p class=Author>Leong Chee Khoon, Chennupati K. Ramaiah and Schubert Foo, 

        Nanyang Technological University, Singapore </p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The Internet is a communication channel where ideas 

        and information may be freely and easily shared and communicated among 

        members of diverse communities around the world. By combining the capabilities 

        of latest computers, communication and multimedia technologies, web-base 

        multimedia systems can be developed and delivered through Internet to 

        the distributed users around the globe. Web-based multimedia systems provide 

        an exciting means and communication channel for information access and 

        sharing throughout the world. These systems have immense potential in 

        public education, stimulating the learning process by exploring and doing, 

        and by bringing children out of their school compound on trips around 

        the world with just a few clicks.  In this study, a web-based multimedia 

        exhibition &#147;Colours of the Wind&#148; was designed and developed 

        based on an existing exhibition that took the original form of static 

        physical displays.  The exhibition is part of a series of National Education 

        exhibitions put together by the National Archives of Singapore to promote 

        heritage information awareness among school children. As part of the design, 

        a requirements gathering study was carried out with 77 university students 

        to determine the users&#146; requirements in terms of their computer and 

        web experience, content expectations of online exhibition and their prior 

        exposure to these systems. Based on these user requirements, a prototype 

        of an online exhibition system was developed which was subsequently evaluated 

        to assess the prototype and to elicit gaps in the design. In the evaluation 

        with 30 students from the same pool form whom requirements were gathered, 

        it was found that the online exhibition was well received by the surveyed 

        community. The respondents were of the opinion that it has satisfied most 

        of their requirements of an online exhibition apart from a search engine. 

        They also felt that online exhibitions were the most flexible mode of 

        delivering heritage information to inculcate awareness among the school 

        children and public, particularly so, in the context of Singapore, because 

        Singapore has one of highest percentages of Internet users of any country 

        in the world. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>In this digital era, technological advances are rapidly changing the 

        environment in which we live. The impact of technology can be felt in 

        many areas, one of which is heritage information delivery. Today, a large 

        percentage of children grow up in cities around the world, where old and 

        culturally significant architectural structures often have to give way 

        to modern buildings due to land scarcity. The loss of such heritage icons 

        and reduced interaction between children and their parents who spend increasingly 

        long hours at work, result in many school-children not being well informed 

        of the historical richness of the ancestors in their society. This is 

        quite unfortunate, because the way leading to nationhood for many countries 

        is often paved with interesting and noteworthy events. Such events will 

        form an important part of a country&#146;s heritage. This information 

        has to be passed to school children, so that they can better understand 

        the efforts and sacrifices of the people who build the nation, understand 

        the cultural diversity in modern society, and contribute productively 

        to foster unity.</p>

      <p>This is where heritage exhibitions enter into the picture.  The National 

        Archives of Singapore collects, manages and preserves historical records, 

        and also promotes public interest in heritage through traveling exhibitions, 

        publications and IT-based projects. It has originally developed a series 

        of exhibitions of differing themes as part of the Singapore&#146;s government 

        larger National Education Initiative to promote cultural heritage information 

        awareness among school children and the general public. Such awareness 

        services took the form of static information panels, multimedia kiosks, 

        audio narratives and videocassettes. However, such physical exhibitions 

        are limited in the demographic reach of their target audience. They are 

        also open to the public to access only at certain times of the day. And, 

        since most of the information is presented in physical form, teacher and 

        student visitors find it difficult to customize the materials for their 

        teaching and learning purposes.</p>

      <p>Online exhibitions offer a practical and cost-effective solution to the 

        above problems. They are no longer limited to time, distance and space. 

        Students from the nation and all around the world can view the exhibitions 

        remotely both from their homes and schools any time. As the contents in 

        the online exhibitions are in digital form, new materials can be added 

        quickly and existing materials can be updated easily. This dramatically 

        reduces the lead-time and eliminates costly physical space required to 

        display an exhibition (Kassay, 1995; Spadaccini, 2000 and Thomas, 1991). 

        Teachers can easily download the digital materials for integrating into 

        their teaching syllabi. Students can also learn to gather online information, 

        organize it, create some meaning to it, reach insight, and present their 

        findings online to their teachers (Boily, 2000 and Sumption, 2001).</p>

      <p>In this project, a prototype online exhibition of a physical exhibition 

        &#147;<i>Colours In The Wind: Old Hill Street Police Station In Retrospect</i>&#148; 

        was developed. This exhibition celebrates the rich history of the Old 

        Hill Street Police Station, a former police barracks which has been converted 

        into the Ministry of Information and The Arts (MITA) building, Singapore.<b> 

        </b></p>

      <h1>Aim and Objectives</h1>

      <p>The aim of this project is to develop an online exhibition for promoting 

        cultural awareness among Singaporeans, and also to study various Internet 

        and multimedia technologies required to build online exhibitions. The 

        objectives of this study are:</p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To elicit users&#146; and information requirements of an online exhibition<br>

          <br>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To find out the impact of online exhibitions on promoting cultural 

          heritage awareness</span></li>

      </ol>

      <h1>Background</h1>

      <p>Prior to designing the online exhibition, we undertook a comprehensive 

        study of existing online exhibitions around the world to examine aspects 

        of their content, presentation, navigational structure, implementation 

        issues, etc.  A number of most important sites are described briefly below:</p>

      <p><i>American History Documents</i> (<a href="../http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/history/history.html" target="_blank">http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/history/history.html</a>) 

        is an online exhibition that showcases some of the most important documents 

        in American heritage, e.g. the Declaration of Independence. Each document 

        is shown as a thumbnail image (192´300 pixels) which can be zoomed to 

        500´780 pixels, together with a short descriptive paragraph. A link is 

        also provided to the full text of the document. </p>

      <p><i>Asian Civilisations Museum </i>(<a href="../http://www.woof.com.sg/acm.htm" target="_blank">http://www.woof.com.sg/acm.htm</a>) 

        was hosted on an online television station (<a href="../http://www.woof.com.sg/" target="_blank">http://www.woof.com.sg</a>) 

        between February and May 2001. It showcases Chinese culture and heritage 

        in architecture, history, symbolism, religion and ceramics. These are 

        presented via narrative videos (MPEG-4 video with MP3 audio) of the curators, 

        who provide brief introductions to each subject area. </p>

      <p><i>Exploring Africa: An Exhibit of Maps and Travel Narratives</i> (<a href="../http://www.sc.edu/library/%20spcoll/sccoll/africa/africa.html" target="_blank">http://www.sc.edu/library/ 

        spcoll/sccoll/africa/africa.html</a>) is an online exhibition on the early 

        history of the African continent. The information is presented through 

        the maps and travel narratives of the Europeans who traveled extensively 

        throughout Africa from the late fifteenth century to the late nineteenth 

        century. </p>

      <p><i>Harlem, 1900-1940: An African American Community</i> (<a href="../http://www.si.umich.edu/%20CHICO/Harlem/" target="_blank">http://www.si.umich.edu/ 

        CHICO/Harlem/</a>) describes the cultural heritage of the African American 

        community. The images on the site may be zoomed from 249´141 pixels to 

        429´271 pixels. Teachers are provided with online information on the objectives 

        of each sub-exhibit, instructional strategies, photograph interpretation 

        and guidelines on oral history. A search engine is also provided to find 

        the related materials in the New York Public Library.</p>

      <p><i>SCRAN</i> (Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network, <a href="../http://www.scran.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.scran.ac.uk</a>) 

        is an online multimedia resource base for Scottish history and culture. 

        It provides carefully designed educational resources, e.g. resource packs 

        with instructions to teachers. SCRAN resources range from static content 

        (text and pictures) to multimedia (audio and video in Apple QuickTime), 

        however, free access to these is limited to Scottish schools and companies 

        only. </p>

      <h1>Methodology</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText2>Fourth generation techniques were utilized for the 

        development of the exhibition.  Such a techniques are characterized by 

        the use of widely available graphical development tools to save development 

        time by abstracting the design problem at a higher level (Dix, 1998; Ghezzi, 

        1991). Through this, the authors were able to concentrate more on the 

        design and functionality aspects. In this case, Dreamweaver 4.0, a web 

        editor was used for prototyping and implementing the online exhibition 

        system. Because Dreamweaver can be used for both the purposes, one can 

        save software resources, design time and manpower. Above all, it is an 

        internationally used, industry standard tool for web design.</p>

      <p>Although there are many evaluation techniques, only five important techniques 

        were considered for use in this project. </p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Surveys based on questionnaires and interviews are channels through 

          which the user can communicate his or her opinions passively (e.g. questionnaires) 

          or actively (e.g. interviews) to the system designer. <br>

          <br>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> In the observation of task performance technique, users are encouraged 

          to be verbose on their actions and problems faced, which will be noted 

          by remote observers for subsequent analysis. <br>

          <br>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Activity logging makes use of manual or automatic recording of the 

          users&#146; actions (e.g. video-taping), which are then examined for 

          possible design problems. <br>

          <br>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Heuristic evaluation is the systematic inspection of a user interface 

          design, based on formally recognised system usability principles. <br>

      <p>The evaluation technique chosen was a combination of co-operative evaluation, 

        together with questionnaire-based surveys. This combination offers the 

        best compromise in terms of resource and time requirements, and the reduction 

        of biases in the final results due to the Hawthorne effect, which causes 

        people being watched to act in a different way because of the presence 

        of the observer (Faulkner, 1998).</p>

      <h1>Requirements Gathering</h1>

      <p>A survey was carried out to determine the user requirements of an online 

        exhibition system for heritage information dissemination. A total of 77 

        respondents took part in the requirements gathering process.  These respondents 

        were postgraduate students mainly in their mid- to late-20s, with equal 

        proportions of males and females. Most of them were familiar with the 

        web and were regularly using computers, so they were familiar with basic 

        computer operations and graphical user interfaces. This was very important 

        because the web is predominantly a point-and-click graphical interface, 

        especially in the case of a browser intensive application such as an online 

        exhibition. About 96% of them own a computer at home with web access, 

        which allowed us in testing the effectiveness and efficiency of content 

        delivery, especially in the case of bandwidth-hungry applications such 

        as digital video streamed across public networks (e.g. the Internet).</p>

      <p>The IBM-PC was the most widely used type of computer (96%), with most 

        of the respondents (97%) using Windows operating systems. These findings 

        were major influences in the decision to develop the online exhibition 

        on the PC platform. The most common monitor screen sizes used by the respondents 

        were the 15&#148; CRT (39%) and the 12.1&#148; LCD (30%). These screens 

        are capable of displaying images up to 800´600 pixels resolution. Surprisingly, 

        15% of the respondents were still using 14&#148; CRT monitors, therefore 

        the screen resolution selected for development was 800´600 pixels, to 

        cover the widest possible user base. Although 71% of the users had 56 

        kbps modems, about 7% of the respondents were still using 33.6 kbps modems. 

        Therefore, streaming video and audio are provided at the lowest possible 

        file-sizes to reach as many viewers as possible.</p>

      <p>The majority (79%) of the respondents surfed the web daily, so most of 

        them were familiar with the use of web browsers. Hence, a basic help system 

        was deemed good enough for these users and a detailed help system is not 

        required. During their interaction with the system, about half of the 

        respondents expected to see something on the screen within 11-30 seconds 

        of the initial click, which mean that the most efficient compression techniques 

        must be used to deliver digital audio and video, with reasonable clarity 

        while playing back. Internet Explorer was the most widely used browser 

        (83%), followed by Netscape (17%). This necessitated the need for cross-browser 

        compatibility through careful coding of DHTML elements so that the system 

        will reach out to most of the users. </p>

      <p>Almost half of the respondents (50%) preferred textual sites with moderate 

        interactivity, while 34% supported highly interactive sites, and the remainder 

        liked text-based sites. A decision was thus taken to incorporate interactivity 

        in the form of DHTML, Java applets and digital audio and video, but exclude 

        complex animations such as Flash and Shockwave. The pervasiveness of Shockwave 

        technology can be observed in the high proportion of users familiar with 

        it (82%). Respondents, especially those with high-bandwidth Internet connections, 

        felt that the interactivity and entertainment value of Shockwave elements 

        were worthwhile in spite of long download times. For this, over half of 

        the respondents (55%) were willing to download the Shockwave browser plug-in, 

        however, 27% found that downloading the plug-in is troublesome.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><b><i>Table</i></b><i> <b>1: Media preference by the 

        respondents</b></i></p>

      <p>Of the respondents, more than half (56%) of them had not visited any 

        online exhibitions before. The respondents who had visited online exhibitions 

        before (44% of them) reported that they were seeing mainly pictures (97%), 

        videos and animation (56%) at the sites. Other media observed were maps, 

        layout plans, diagrams and virtual reality scenes. The most common form 

        of online exhibitions seen by these respondents were art galleries on 

        the web, in which static images were seen more often than animations, 

        audio and video clips. Images were considered to be most important form 

        by the respondents (83%), followed by video (70%), and then text and audio 

        (69%). Animation was felt to be slightly less important (60%), while a 

        small percentage (4%) of the respondents would also like to see online 

        help, zoom features and interactive media. </p>

      <p>The majority of the respondents (59%) preferred brief abstracts with 

        links for more detailed information, whereas 38% liked only brief abstracts 

        and 3% also expressed the need for elaborated text. This is consistent 

        with the basic design philosophy of web information systems, which is 

        to cut down the amount of information presented on each page for better 

        reading. About three-quarters of the respondents indicated that there 

        is a need for text transcripts to accompany the audio and video clips. 

        Of these, English was the most preferred language (86%), while 12% would 

        like to have multi-lingual transcripts. </p>

      <p>A large proportion of respondents (89%) indicated that important historic 

        events should be accompanied with video clips for better understanding 

        of the events. Video clips of moderate duration (between 2 to 5 minutes) 

        were considered appropriate to them. About 56% of the respondents indicated 

        that they would rather see animations than video clips, so that it would 

        help them to quickly display the movie file on the web. Nearly 72% preferred 

        Shockwave animations, followed by animated GIFs  (51%), AVI animations 

        (49%), Java applets (42%) and DHTML animations (23%). This clearly shows 

        that the majority of the users want to see shorter video clips of all 

        the important events, but they are quite flexible about the video form 

        or format. Depending upon the context, the video format can vary from 

        animated GIF to digital movie so that downloading time will be faster.</p>

      <p>A larger proportion (87%) of the respondents agreed that online exhibitions 

        have considerable educational value; however, 13% considered otherwise. 

        About 78% of the respondents expressed interest in getting more information 

        from archival organisations, so these exhibitions may be provided links 

        to other sources for getting more information. The most popular archival 

        items (80%) that the respondents were interested in were photographs, 

        particularly on historic sites, followed by audio/video recordings and 

        maps/charts (77%), public records (67%) and oral history (57%). This clearly 

        shows that the respondents were not so keen on textual information, but 

        more interested in other media resources. This means multimedia with minimum 

        textual information was popular, but links for additional information 

        should be provided.</p>

      <p>Most of the respondents (94%) felt the need for a good search engine 

        for effectively retrieving the information, online help, and selective 

        dissemination of information (SDI) through e-mail. Content accuracy was 

        vital, together with quizzes, tutorials and games to bring the educational 

        message across to the school children. Site personalisation or customisation 

        was also suggested by some of the respondents. A few also felt that different 

        information formats were needed to cater to the different modem download 

        speeds of users. Free access to all the archived materials on a topic 

        and links to other relevant materials would help them in getting the complete 

        information. There were also suggestions for more advanced user interfaces 

        and systems to cater to visually impaired users, virtual reality (VR) 

        and video on demand (VOD) applications for advanced users.</p>

      <h1>Design and Development of the Prototype Online Exhibition System</h1>

      <p>The <i>Colours In The Wind</i> online exhibition was developed with three 

        major components: the &#147;Manager&#148;, &#147;Sub-Exhibits Content&#148; 

        and &#147;Support&#148; components as shown in Figure 1. The &#147;Manager&#148; 

        component consists of a &#147;main&#148; directory that contains the administrative 

        pages, and a global stylesheet. The administrative pages comprise of an 

        &#147;About&#148; page that describes the online exhibition in general, 

        a &#147;Site Map&#148; page that briefly explains the contents of each 

        sub-exhibit, a set of &#147;Help&#148; pages, a &#147;Search&#148; page 

        and a &#147;Feedback&#148; page. Links to these pages are provided through 

        a horizontal navigation bar in a title frame at the top of each page, 

        so that they can be reached from anywhere within the online exhibition. 

        There is also a pull-down selection list of menu options, which are used 

        to select each sub-exhibit for browsing. </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="k.ramaiah_Ramaiah.Fig1.jpg" width="471" height="283"></p>

      <p>The &#147;Sub-Exhibits Content&#148; component contains the pages for 

        each of the twelve sub-exhibits, organised into seven directories. The 

        &#147;Support&#148; component consists of an &#147;audio&#148; directory 

        that contains the oral interview sound clips, a &#147;video&#148; directory 

        that holds the video clips, and an &#147;images&#148; directory that contains 

        all the pictures used in the online exhibition. The &#147;images&#148; 

        directory is further divided into sub-directories, each one containing 

        the images used in each sub-exhibit, with a &#147;gen&#148; sub-directory 

        to hold the images used by the &#147;Manager&#148; component (e.g. images 

        used in the &#147;Help&#148; pages), and a &#147;nav&#148; sub-directory 

        to store the navigation button images. In addition, there is a &#147;download&#148; 

        directory that contains the Netscape plug-in for the Windows Media Player; 

        this plug-in can be downloaded by Netscape users to view the Windows Media 

        audio and video clips used in the online exhibition.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="k.ramaiah_Ramaiah.Fig2.jpg" width="519" height="436"><br>

      </p>

      <p>Figure 2 shows the home page of the online exhibition. All the pages 

        in the site share the same general formatting using cascading stylesheets. 

        An animated flashing &#147;Visit&#148; label at the top left corner of 

        the screen draws the visitor&#146;s attention to the exhibit selector. 

        The exhibit selector was implemented using a pull-down menu with automatic 

        page re-direction, instead of a left-hand frame with links, because some 

        of the sub-exhibit titles were rather long. This helped to save screen 

        space and made the look less cluttered, to reduce the visitor&#146;s cognitive 

        overload.</p>

      <p>Each page is divided into three horizontal sections (frames). The top 

        navigation bar holds commonly accessed pages (e.g. the &#147;Help&#148; 

        pages), which can be clicked from any page since the navigation bar is 

        located in the fixed top horizontal frame. The large middle section is 

        the content area that holds the text and multimedia elements used in the 

        online exhibition. The bottom section of the page contains navigation 

        buttons and the title of the currently using section. At the bottom left 

        corner of each page, there is a navigational bar with three navigation 

        buttons. These are the standard &#147;Previous&#148;, the &#147;Next&#148;, 

        and the &#147;Back&#148; buttons used in all the web designs. The &#147;Back&#148; 

        button brings the user back to the last visited page, which is similar 

        to the function of the &#147;Back&#148; button provided by the browser.</p>

      <p>To reach a sub-exhibit quickly, a pull-down menu is provided at the top 

        left-hand corner of each page in the online exhibition. This pull-down 

        menu contains links to the starting page of each sub-exhibit. On the right 

        of the pull-down menu, there is a horizontal navigation bar containing 

        links to the &#147;About&#148; page, the &#147;Site Map&#148; page, the 

        &#147;Help&#148; page, the &#147;Search&#148; page and the &#147;Feedback&#148; 

        page.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="k.ramaiah_Ramaiah.Fig3.jpg" width="497" height="301"></p>

      <p>The original text of the physical exhibition was broken down into major 

        topics, which were further divided into sub-topics based on the general 

        flow of the original topic (see Figure 3). Due to time constraints, only 

        the video clips in English were provided with English transcripts. English 

        transcripts were provided to only the English audio clips but not for 

        the Chinese, Malay and Tamil audio clips because of translation problems. 

      </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="k.ramaiah_Ramaiah.Fig4.jpg" width="543" height="386"></p>

      <p>It was decided to embed the media player inside the web pages instead 

        of playing media clips in a standalone player, which consumes more processor 

        resources (see Figure 4). Furthermore, the standalone player would pop 

        up in a separate window above the web browser, blocking the user&#146;s 

        view of the text transcript, which would be inconvenient for the user 

        to close after the media finishes playing.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="k.ramaiah_Ramaiah.Fig5.jpg" width="368" height="284"></p>

      <p>For architectural themes, a 3-dimensional viewer has been provided via 

        a Java applet (see Figure5) that displays a slowly spinning view of selected 

        sections of the <i>Old Hill Street Police Station</i> building. This provides 

        a virtual reality interface that let the users explore parts of the building.</p>

      <p>Online help pages are also provided for users to know how to use the 

        site effectively. They present basic help information to users about the 

        organization and use of each section. Each help page comprises of short 

        text, mostly in bulleted lists for easier reading, and appropriate graphics. 

        In fact, the general design of the online exhibition has been deliberately 

        kept simple with the objective of making it intuitively easy for visitors 

        to browse the site, even without looking at the help pages before foraying 

        into the exhibit pages.</p>

      <h1>User Evaluation</h1>

      <p>An evaluation was carried out on the online exhibition through a questionnaire-based 

        survey process. Of the total number of 30 participants, half of them were 

        in their mid-twenties, with females outnumbering males by nearly two-thirds 

        (63% females versus 37% males). Most of them were students, librarians, 

        teachers and IT professionals. There was about 70% overlap in respondents 

        in the user requirements and evaluation surveys. There was a good mix 

        of professional backgrounds, particularly the students, librarians and 

        teachers, who will be potential users of such exhibitions. Students are 

        more particular about the critical design problems, while other professionals 

        provide technical inputs on improving the efficiency and effectiveness 

        of content delivery.</p>

      <p>The majority of them (74%) felt that the text size chosen (Verdana 10 

        point) was appropriate and readable, and the use of colours, buttons and 

        icons was appropriate (70%). The use of cascading stylesheets to control 

        the formatting and general appearance of the pages in the online exhibition 

        helped in the visual consistency of the pages. Stylesheets provide a powerful 

        mechanism for maintaining a consistent and (most importantly) cross-browser 

        look for all the pages. Surprisingly, though this site is simple and plain, 

        nearly half the respondents (46%) found that the site was attractive. 

        This could be traced to the fact that most of the respondents were adults 

        who were more interested in content and simple presentation over excessive 

        aesthetics to attract younger users.</p>

      <p>The online exhibition is also an information system, and as such, the 

        information must be organized in such a way as to allow the users to access 

        information easily. About 67% of the respondents found that the organization 

        of information was good. The contents were reasonably comprehensive (37%), 

        although some respondents pointed out that there was too little details 

        on certain topics at a few places. Therefore, more information along with 

        links to other resources related to those areas needs to be provided. 

        Due to the absence of a search engine, one-third of the respondents (33%) 

        were neutral when they were asked about the ease of finding information 

        within the site. Due to time and resource constraints, it was decided 

        to relegate the development of a search engine to Phase II of the project, 

        in which a proper search engine could be developed to index and search 

        not only text but also multimedia elements such as images, video and audio.</p>

      <p>Almost half of the respondents (57%) found that the exhibit selector 

        (a drop-down list) was easy to locate. This was because the selector was 

        deliberately placed at the top left-hand corner of the screen. Its presence 

        was further highlighted with a flashing &#147;Visit&#148; animation beside 

        it, and it was explained in the Help pages. However, a respondent suggested 

        that the selector may be at the center of the navigation bar for better 

        visibility. According to interface design principles, the top left-hand 

        area of the screen is the most important one in terms of its visibility, 

        so the selector menu was placed there. In general, the respondents found 

        that navigation within the site is easy; even without reading the Help 

        pages, the visitors are able to use the online exhibition. In terms of 

        speed of downloading, the respondents generally felt that the pages loaded 

        fast enough. This could be attributed to the basic design of the online 

        exhibition site, which does not require the user to download special plug-ins, 

        e.g. the Shockwave plug-in to view Shockwave movies.</p>

      <p>Most of the respondents (90%) never read the Help pages before exploring 

        the online exhibition. However, for those who did not do so, almost all 

        of them (96%) agreed that the user interface was simple for them to browse 

        without further assistance. For those who had gone through the Help pages, 

        60% of them found the details are sufficient to understand the system. 

      </p>

      <p>All of the respondents used the Windows operating system, and most of 

        them (87%) were using the Internet Explorer browser compared to the Netscape 

        browser (13%). In general, there was no problem in delivering the multimedia 

        elements through both the browsers, since the drivers for playing back 

        the clips were cross-browser compatible. Most respondents found that the 

        media clips can be viewed. However, there were a few hiccups in video 

        reception, resulting in jerky frames and the corresponding garbled audio 

        narrative. It was found that this was due to the fact that the web server 

        hosting the online exhibition was a Pentium I-based server without MMX 

        capabilities to support multimedia. </p>

      <p>On an average, 60% of the respondents felt that the window size of the 

        video player, frames rate and the playing times of the media clips were 

        acceptable. About 73% of the respondents found that the multimedia elements 

        were useful in enhancing the learning experience, and the text transcripts 

        were useful in aiding the understanding the A-V clip contents. A small 

        percentage of the respondents (20%) encountered difficulties in loading 

        the video stream, resulting in reading the text transcript without seeing 

        the video, which was admittedly not an enhanced experience.</p>

      <h1>Ongoing Studies and Future Extensions</h1>

      <p>This project formed the basis from which advanced studies could be carried 

        out in several directions. A large-scale requirements gathering study 

        is going on with a 400-user sample from a myriad of professions, extending 

        the existing study which was done solely with university students. In 

        addition, a fully developed version of the online exhibition is being 

        developed in HTML, and compared against the same exhibition with an animated 

        user interface. Content delivery models will also be examined to find 

        out the most preferred and efficient method of packaging and providing 

        online heritage information to the public, for example, over the web, 

        or delivery of information through CD-ROMs, etc. Another area under study 

        is the management of digital media centers &#150; their setup, media asset 

        management and content management. Finally, the indexing and retrieval 

        of multimedia resources using the latest programming approaches (e.g. 

        Java) are also being explored.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p>This project has demonstrated the feasibility of using online exhibition 

        systems to promote cultural heritage information in today&#146;s world, 

        based on the availability of modern powerful computers, communications 

        technology, multimedia technology, and the Internet. Details of historical 

        events can be brought alive via streaming video technology, which are 

        becoming readily available to many users. However, the user interface 

        of such systems must be kept simple so as to reach out to as many users 

        as possible. In general, it was felt that a moderate level of interactivity 

        was also needed to attract and retain the attention of the younger generation. 

        Finally, the simple and best design will attract the visitors to visit 

        the exhibitions again and again to gather more information, which requires 

        the system to become a truly dynamic information system for the promotion 

        of cultural heritage.</p>

      <p>Heritage information systems have an important role in preserving and 

        promoting the cultural information of the world, as well as help to foster 

        global cross-cultural exchanges. By knowing what has taken place in the 

        past, and appreciating the cultures of one another, the human race can 

        then build a better world tomorrow &#150; one where mutual co-operation 

        and understanding reigns over conflict for the good of all mankind. </p>
