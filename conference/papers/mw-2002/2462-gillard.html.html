      <p class=PaperTitle>Cruising Through <i>History Wired</i></p>

      <p class=Author>Patricia Gillard, User Insite Pty Ltd, Australia</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>This paper presents the results of an evaluation of 

        <i>History Wired</i> conducted at the National Museum of American History 

        (NMAH), Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, during March and April 

        200l prior to its launch in August, 2001. The methods were based on ethnographic 

        and constructivist approaches rather than heuristic or usability testing.  

        Eleven groups of visitors (31 individuals) viewed the <i>History Wired</i> 

        site which was in development at the NMAH. Visitors were asked to use 

        the site together for five to ten minutes, and then to answer some interview 

        questions. Observation of their uses of navigation, as well as choices 

        for more information and general movement around the site, were noted. 

        Their comments during the session as well as the interview were taped 

        for later analysis.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The results showed 

        that all visitors were very engaged with the site, even if they had limited 

        Web knowledge. The aims of designers, to give direct access to the user, 

        and to provide many ways of finding and enjoying objects, were well realized. 

        Visitors used the site in distinctive ways, including &#145;reading&#146; 

        from left to right, following subject interests and themes by use of the 

        keywords, and navigating through objects. The study predicted the site&#146;s 

        success with audience groups and suggested wording changes to make the 

        interface more descriptive of the actual contents. Once visitors used 

        the Web site, they were likely to want many more objects to be available 

        on-line and to make further enquiries at the Museum site. </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Keywords: evaluation, ethnography, user research, 

        audiences, interviews, interface design, usability testing </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>This paper presents a Web site evaluation with a difference. Its approach builds 

        on audience and communications research of the past fifteen years and 

        can be described in broad terms as semiotic, ethnographic and constructivist. 

        User Insite has been applying these approaches to evaluation of Web sites 

        since 1997, but the ideas on which they are based have a longer history. 

        In communications research there has been theoretical discussion of the 

        ways the contents of television and new media create and position audiences 

        and audiences negotiate these positions to construct their own meanings. 

        Examples are found in Reception research (Charlton &amp; Bachmair, 1990), 

        Cultural Studies and Audience Ethnography (Livingstone &amp; Bovill, 1999; 

        Howard, 1998; Ang, 1996; Buckingham, 1993; Moores, 1993; Lull, 1990) and 

        Naturalistic studies (Lindlof, 1987). </p>

      <p>My own research began with close descriptive studies of children viewing television 

        in the 1980s, (Palmer, 1986). Audiences have always been interactive in 

        their behavior and active in constructing meanings, but this was usually 

        downplayed by the media industries in the production process . Now we 

        have a new medium where the relationships between audience members and 

        contents must be made visible in the production process and &#145;built 

        in&#146; to the design. Research appropriate to the new Web medium seeks 

        the patterns in users&#146; engagement with Web <i>contents</i> and relates 

        this to the everyday contexts of users (sometimes referred to as audiences 

        or visitors). </p>

      <p>The Museums and the Web conference has been a leader in tracing the shape of 

        developments in Web site evaluation. We are very pleased to be presenting 

        our own work here, and continuing the discussion about evaluation research 

        to improve museum Web sites.</p>

      <h2>Aims of the project</h2>

      <p>The aims of this research were:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">to describe the variety of ways that visitors to the physical museum 

          engaged with the <i>History Wired</i> interface and its contents</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">to seek visitor suggestions for changes or improvements</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">to gauge reactions to the name</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> to discern whether the intended aims were being realized </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">to maximize the effectiveness of the program</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p><i>HistoryWired: A few of our favorite </i>things (<a href="../http://historywired.si.edu/" target="_blank">http://historywired.si.edu</a>) 

        is described as &#145;an experimental program through which you can take 

        a virtual tour of selected objects from the vast collections of the National 

        Museum of American History. Here you'll have an opportunity to look at 

        hundreds of museum artifacts, most of which are not currently on exhibit&#146;. 

        The Web site uses a &#145;tiled&#146; interface, designed by <i>Smartmoney.com,</i> 

        to give direct access to descriptions of over 400 objects. The text and 

        associated materials were especially written for the interests of broad 

        audiences who are not necessarily museum visitors. </p>

      <p>Because <i>History Wired</i> is database driven, changes could be made to the 

        site to reflect the actions and interests of audience members, as they 

        became known through their actual uses and comments.</p>

      <p>This paper describes the major patterns that emerged in a close study of thirty-one 

        participants in eleven sessions. These patterns would be expected to recur 

        in many engagements with the Web site, but there may be additional forms 

        of engagement that have not yet been observed.</p>

      <h1>Methods</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Between 12 and 19 March 

        2001, research sessions were conducted with a variety of visitor groups 

        to the NMAH. The purpose of the sessions was to observe the spontaneous 

        interests of users rather than setting predetermined tasks. This way, 

        we could discover how the Web site shaped a variety of responses, and 

        how users created their own experience from the many possibilities of 

        navigation and content. An open-ended interview was included to ask questions 

        of importance to the Web site creators, as well as to gain comment about 

        matters arising in the observation from the users&#146; perspective. </p>

      <p>Eleven interviews were conducted with naturally occurring visitor groups. This 

        included a total of 31 people. Participants were selected from those in 

        attendance at the museum at different times of day. Participants were 

        approached and asked if they would be willing to look at a new Web site 

        that was being developed for the museum. If they agreed, they were taken 

        a short distance to a conference room, the Lemelson Center, from which 

        they could still see out to the public areas. The test site was available 

        on a laptop computer, and participants made their own decisions about 

        who would use the mouse. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The two distinctive 

        methods were as follows:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">An observation session, where the researcher sat alongside visitors 

          as they explored the Web site. The observer made notes of actions by 

          participants and noted new content pages. She would answer questions 

          and show features if visitors asked or stayed &#145;stuck&#146; for 

          some time. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> An open-ended interview, when questions were asked of the visitors 

          about content, navigation, favorite objects, missing features, likely 

          audiences and responses to the name.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Sessions varied from 

        13 minutes to one hour, with larger groups taking a longer time. The average 

        session time was 25 minutes. More than half came from other states, on 

        a holiday or on a school trip. Two groups lived nearby and were on a break 

        from work.</p>

      <p>The following groups were involved in the research: </p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Father and adult son (20s), visiting to follow up father&#146;s war 

          experience</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Four friends from college, visiting during college break</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Six 8<sup>th</sup> grade students (13/14 years old) on a school excursion, 

          (2 boys, 4 girls)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A retired couple and their adult daughter, a teacher </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Mother (40s) and son, (20s) visiting from Texas</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Three 8<sup>th</sup> grade girls, friends, touring Washington (with 

          school) from Albuquerque</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> A couple, late 20s, Washington</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Family of 4 from Texas, first time in Washington. Son 15 or 16, daughter 

          11or 12.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Male college lecturer and former high school teacher, social scientist 

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Mother (30s) and daughter, 6<sup>th</sup> grade </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Two female friends, (20s), health professionals</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The observation sessions 

        and interviews were taped and later transcribed. The transcriptions and 

        observation notes together gave a full description of the session, and 

        these accounts formed the basis of an interpretive analysis. A &#145;history&#146; 

        of each session recorded the actual pages visited by each group as part 

        of the Web site browser activity, but this data has not been included 

        in the analysis.</p>

      <h1>Observations</h1>

      <h2>Initial reactions and general comments</h2>

      <p>In the observation stages, everyone began by moving the mouse across the map. 

        Only one person tested the site by himself; the others were with friends 

        or family. Perhaps as a result of this, comments and talk accompanied 

        the use of the Web site. The talk was sometimes quiet and directed and 

        other times noisy and expressive. Many unsolicited comments were made 

        about the interface during the observations. From the beginning all the 

        comments were positive, even glowing. Examples were:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>In&#146;t (sic) that 

        cool?</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>That&#146;s really neat</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>This is amazing it really 

        is- you just open it all back up again</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>This is really something. 

        Very impressive</p>

      <p>In three of the sessions, people mentioned they could spend &#145;a lot of time&#146; 

        or &#145;all day&#146; looking at the site. </p>

      <p>In most sessions, one person would read out the titles of the boxes or images, 

        or they would read them out together. When they saw an image, for example 

        &#145;Inside the Lone Ranger&#146;s Mask&#146;, or read a description, 

        there was often laughter or personal comment. For example, in response 

        to the knives displayed in a Yiddish shop sign: &#145;Wild! Don&#146;t 

        think I can handle that&#146;. </p>

      <h2>Distinctive forms of engagement with 

        the Web site</h2>

      <p>As with all communications media, <i>History 

        Wired</i> appealed to particular kinds of audiences. The creators of the 

        site wanted to present and describe objects in ways that would appeal 

        to broad and non-specialist audiences. The innovative nature of the Web 

        site interface also raised questions about how it would be put to use 

        by different audience groups.</p>

      <p>The following were the distinctive patterns 

        of use that were observed.</p>

      <h3>Using the mouse to travel left to right across the map, returning to 

        the left and reading across again. </h3>

      <p>This approach mirrored conventional &#145;reading&#146; 

        and was only observed in one session. As her cursor moved, the user read 

        pop-up labels but did not click and explore further images and information. 

        When this possibility was pointed out towards the end of the session, 

        she tried it a couple of times but mainly continued to read the map left 

        to right . The woman was visiting the museum with older parents and was 

        a grade school teacher, probably in her forties. She did not use the Internet 

        at home, only at school in connection with teaching. </p>

      <h3>Quickly exploring the dimensions of the content, both the surface geography 

        of the map and the information pages behind it</h3>

      <p>One group of six 8<sup>th</sup> grade 

        students did this with great enthusiasm and speed, with statements of 

        &#145;cool!&#146; accompanying their discoveries. The person with the 

        mouse, a girl, began by exploring in circles within the main concept groups, 

        in this case &#145;Home/clothing&#146;, then added selections of keywords 

        at the top. They discovered there were categories within categories.</p>

      <p>Once the back pages were discovered, 

        which happened after a few minutes, they combined fast exploration of 

        the map with clicking on back pages and further information pages whenever 

        various members of the group indicated an interest. This group did not 

        find the timeline or zoom features, but when they were told about them 

        late in the session, they were so excited, they began another round of 

        fast exploration.</p>

      <h3>Careful exploration of the Web site to answer particular interests. 

      </h3>

      <p>Three of the visitor groups, who were 

        with family members, including adult children, used the site in this way. 

        One example of this was a father and son who looked at the site, then 

        discussed an author, Stephen Ambrose, associated with military history. 

        They spent most time on directed activity, selecting the keyword, &#145;Military&#146; 

        as well as moving around the relevant sections. They quickly discovered 

        and used the back pages in these thematic areas. As they explored the 

        site (the adult son used the mouse), they commented to each other about 

        what they were finding and what they wanted. They didn&#146;t find specific 

        information about &#145;101<sup>st</sup> Airborne&#146;, which was what 

        they had come to the museum itself looking for that day, but they did 

        find objects of interest to them.</p>

      <p>A second family grouping who used the 

        site in a similar way was a school-aged daughter and her mother. They 

        were remarkable for the intense interest in reading every word of all 

        the information about particular subjects such as the &#145;Star-Spangled 

        Banner&#146;. They scrolled down to do this. Again, they were unhurried 

        and talked about the subject matter as they went.</p>

      <h3>Experimenting with the navigation functions</h3>

      <p>A fourth approach was guided not so much 

        by thematic content or personal interest as by selection of particular 

        functions that people found interesting to use in themselves. One adult 

        son with his mother explored the site mainly using the zoom function, 

        the topic menu on the left hand side and the enlarge function. It took 

        them some minutes at the beginning to find these and use them, but then 

        they enjoyed the interface itself, choosing back pages for familiar content 

        such as Kermit, Benny Goodman and the Gutenberg Bible. </p>

      <h3>Seeking the visual experience of objects</h3>

      <p>A fifth approach seemed to focus on inspection 

        of the variety of visual images, yielding a close engagement with the 

        objects. Two women friends in their twenties found the <i>zoom </i>and 

        <i>enlarge </i>features early and systematically viewed objects of interest 

        by reading out the titles in the zoom display, clicking for the information 

        pages, reading the first paragraph (they didn&#146;t scroll down) and 

        then enlarging the image. They talked about the objects themselves as 

        they did this.</p>

      <p>The different patterns of engagement 

        show that <i>History Wired</i> provides a variety of possibilities for 

        different audiences. Even those who have little experience with the Internet 

        can explore the site systematically, gaining pleasure from the thumbnail 

        images and the labels on the map. The intention of the designers, to provide 

        direct experience of a large number of objects and to place in the hands 

        of users many different ways of driving their own experience, has met 

        with very positive responses. Some enjoyed the driving itself while others 

        were more focused on content, or they could hop from image to image. This 

        is a feature which is not characteristic of most Web sites. While the 

        content may vary based on user selections, sites rarely provide different 

        &#145;driving experiences&#146;. </p>

      <p>Some of the functions, such as the zoom, 

        timeline and drop-down menu, were not used by many. However, they were 

        all used by some, to support their exploration of the site. Confident 

        users, experienced with scrolling and drop-down menus, had much more depth 

        of experience, and it was then their purposes or personal preferences 

        for image or written text that seemed to determine the ways they used 

        the site. </p>

      <p>The site was very flexible in providing 

        different reading experiences. There was an immediate engagement with 

        the written descriptions, though most users read the first few paragraphs 

        only. There were no difficulties with the reading, and three groups read 

        all of the text for some of the objects they chose. </p>

      <h1>Interviews</h1>

      <h2>Overall reactions</h2>

      <p>Responses to the interview question, 

        &#145;What did you like best?&#146; confirmed the very positive comments 

        made while people were exploring.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>It&#146;s like walking 

        around the museum, exactly the same way, it&#146;s also better &#145;cos 

        we&#146;re not walking around</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I enjoyed all of it</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>It&#146;s keeping up 

        with technology we have today</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>It&#146;s really informative 

        and original and it&#146;d be helpful I think</p>

      <p>One boy in 8<sup>th</sup> grade who had 

        not had a turn with the mouse made the observation:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I kind of like the way 

        it was but I guess some people would want it simpler. My mother who&#146;s 

        completely computer illiterate&#133; I think it would be hard for her.</p>

      <h2>Comparison with other Web sites</h2>

      <p><b><i>Interviewees</i></b> <b><i>liked the originality of the site 

        and the associations it made.</i></b></p>

      <p class="BlockQuote"><i><span class="normal">Father: I've never seen a 

        Web site like that. The format is different. Smaller or something.</span></i></p>

      <p class="BlockQuote"><i><span class="normal">Son: It&#146;s the first Web 

        site [I&#146;ve] seen with so much stuff and a different way of finding 

        it. Usually you just click. There&#146;s a wide variety, saves a lot of 

        time.</span></i></p>

      <h3>One person interviewed was an educator knowledgeable about Web site 

        design:</h3>

      <p class=BlockQuote>If you&#146;re doing research on a particular thing, 

        you can't search immediately. But it&#146;s like you throw a dart at a 

        dartboard, you see other avenues in trying to get a more well-rounded 

        collection of information about this particular thing. Nice.</p>

      <h3>A college student observed:</h3>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I&#146;ve never seen another site that you can actually 

        section up in little tiles like that before&#133;see it before you even 

        open up the page, see what it relates to.</p>

      <h2>Favorite features</h2>

      <p>A favorite feature mentioned in four 

        interviews was the connection between the map and the keywords along the 

        top, shown by pointer lines connecting them. Another was the timeline, 

        and the ability to access all objects at once.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Daughter: I like the 

        pictures and the timeline.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Mother: I like the multiple 

        references up at the top, especially as you cursor around, the reference 

        points back up to bar. That's pretty nifty.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I&#146;m really impressed 

        with the connectivity between choices, these lines coming down, works 

        well for me, a kind of graphic orientation. The whole idea of highlighting 

        boxes pertaining to category is very nice as well.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I like the way it&#146;s 

        set up where it&#146;s all in one place. In a lot of places, like, you 

        can still look at the site&#133;it&#146;s simpler, like it&#146;s all 

        more compact.</p>

      <h2>Favorite objects</h2>

      <p>People could name their favorite objects. 

        Their answers revealed a connection between the favorites and their own 

        interests. One grade 6 schoolgirl observed:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I liked the Log Cabin. 

        Interesting. A bit of history. I like history a lot.</p>

      <p>A nurse commented:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I liked the medicines. 

        It's my job. Anything to do with medicine and medical history I like.</p>

      <p>Pleasure in the objects was one of the 

        major satisfactions of the Web site. This was observed rather than commented 

        on in the interviews. As groups explored the front and back pages, they 

        would read titles together, respond, comment and read further with interjections 

        of &#145;cool&#146;. &#145;neat&#146;,&#146; Oh that&#146;s nice&#146;. 

        Selection of the objects was successful in providing for the diverse interests 

        of the group tested. The inclusion of some familiar objects enhanced their 

        engagement with the site.</p>

      <h2>Improvements</h2>

      <p>There were criticisms and suggestions 

        for improvement of the site. The suggestion made by the majority of visitors 

        was for the addition of a search facility. [The current version of the 

        program now has a search facility.]</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I think it would be 

        a better research tool if you had a search engine.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Search. Make it easier&#133; 

        What you are thinking might not be same as what the person who made this 

        was thinking.</p>

      <p>In three interviews, there was a request 

        for additional information about objects: whether they were available 

        to be seen; and a floor plan to show their exact locations.</p>

      <p>Other suggestions included:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> emphasize the drop-down menu </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">add categories such as &#145;furnishings&#146; and &#145;accessories&#146; 

          in smaller lettering to the Home/clothing section on the map</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">give more information about categories such as &#145;Communication&#146; 

          on the map</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">define the lines around the sub-category areas more clearly</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">change color when the box has been selected</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">connect this Web site with the Smithsonian and NMAH web environments</span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Intended audience</h2>

      <p>Groups were asked who the Web site was 

        especially made for. Half of those interviewed saw it as useful for those 

        who were planning a trip to the museum, or following up afterwards:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>You could find a bunch 

        of items that you want to see. When we came we didn&#146;t know what we 

        wanted to see&#133; we had trouble deciding what we wanted to see.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>If you were interested 

        in something here you could see if you could find some more information 

        from the Web site.</p>

      <p>They defined the following types of audiences:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">&#145;Someone that&#146;s out of town and looking to come to Washington&#146;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> &#145;Me!&#146; (a grade school girl)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> &#145;Someone who is inquisitive&#146;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> A grade 6 or junior high school student looking for a particular 

          item or time period</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Classroom teachers who are going to give assignments to their students</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Older people because of the easy access</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p>Its particular attraction for younger 

        people was described:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>There&#146;s a cause 

        and effect thing going on here. As soon as I move the cursor, a lot of 

        things are happening which would be very engaging to school and high school 

        age children.</p>

      <p><i>History Wired</i> 

        was also thought to appeal to an audience who were interested in just 

        exploring:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>If ever you&#146;re 

        not looking for something in particular it would be fun to mess around 

        with it.</p>

      <h2>The name</h2>

      <p>People were asked what they thought of 

        the name and what it meant. This is not reported in detail because the 

        original name will probably be used for future on-line exhibitions. It 

        was discovered that the original name polarized the audience . Young people 

        liked it, because it was dramatic and a bit daring. Older people rejected 

        it because it could be misunderstood as an insult. It was uncanny that 

        in one group the students thought up one of the potential names suggested 

        by curatorial staff, and rejected it.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I think it&#146;s cool 

        because a lot of the names you see, it would be like &#145;American Artifacts&#146;. 

        I think that would be really boring.</p>

      <h2>Voting</h2>

      <p>Participants could vote on how much they 

        liked the description for each object that they viewed. A question about 

        the voting option and whether participants would use it was asked in each 

        interview because very few people used the voting function during the 

        observations. Younger users seemed to like the voting option whereas those 

        beyond school age were not interested, or said they would prefer to vote 

        about something more meaningful like the quality of information.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I 

        like it. You get to have an opinion on something. When you go to vote, 

        it takes you to a screen about what percentage of people said yes and 

        no. Will it do that?</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Yes, 

        I vote on Web sites. Like the pop culture and stuff. You vote if you think 

        she's pretty or you think her dress is good. I feel like more of an individual</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I&#146;m not likely 

        to do it. At this level it&#146;s sort of a teaser&#133;I would vote on 

        the next level, the depth of information. I&#146;ve not invested much 

        time personally at this point.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Didn&#146;t see it, 

        I would vote if it referred to a description but not just if I like it.</p>

      <p>In one family, the younger daughter said 

        &#145;yes&#146; but the father said &#145;no&#146; and the adult son said 

        he &#145;didn&#146;t care&#146;.</p>

      <h2>Specific features</h2>

      <p>The interviews did not seek comments 

        about every detailed feature of the Web site. However, where comments 

        were made about specific features, they are listed below. <b></b></p>

      <h3>The map</h3>

      <p class=BlockQuote>­­First I was lost, 

        confused but after a while it was cool, once you figured out how it worked</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>The pop-up menus are 

        nice. See what you are looking at. Neat that it overlaps, gets darker</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Pretty 

        easy to understand<b></b></p>

      <h3>Regions</h3>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I 

        was confused about the black lines cos I know it&#146;s all broken into 

        categories&#133; is this all Communication?</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Home 

        and Clothing. (she demonstrates) This part is more like furnishings, such 

        as bowls, and this one&#146;s more like accessories. You have Lincoln&#146;s 

        hat then you have a charm bracelet&#133;it would be better if it said 

        what the divides mean. </p>

      <h3>Information pages</h3>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Oh, 

        these secondary screens have a nice clean look. Meaningful options. This 

        is a pretty substantive lot of information. Here is where I'm more likely 

        to go.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Once 

        I started to use the further information, I got the idea.<b></b></p>

      <h3>Zoom</h3>

      <p class=BlockQuote>That 

        is so cool&#133; It has different varieties of all the information. Moves 

        around.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I like it, it&#146;s not so busy. Like taking the map 

        and simplifying it a lot.</p>

      <h3>Drop-down menu</h3>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Headings? 

        Good because you can narrow it down to what your interest is. It makes 

        it a lot easier to use.</p>

      <h1>Audience and content development</h1>

      <p>The questions about <i>History Wired</i> 

        concerned the ways in which the Web site attracted particular kinds of 

        audiences, and the ways these audiences engaged with the site. Over time, 

        new audience relationships will be created by the site&#146;s content 

        and innovative design. </p>

      <p>The detailed study of audience/content 

        relationships suggests further strategies to develop content and extend 

        the audiences for the Web site. Because these strategies are based on 

        current interactions of audience members with the site, they are likely 

        to succeed.</p>

      <h2>Audiences</h2>

      <h3>Professionals in the image-related industries (media, publishing, architecture, 

        graphic arts, etc)</h3>

      <p>NMAH currently receives many requests 

        to librarians and curators about images of objects it possesses, to be 

        used in publications and other communication. <i>History Wired </i>is 

        likely to attract the interest of such professionals. <b></b></p>

      <h3>Genealogists and family historians</h3>

      <p>People interested in family history are 

        a very large group with strong international research links and excellent 

        Internet skills. They are usually over 45 years of age, with time to research 

        and explore. Contents on <i>History Wired</i> about particular families, 

        or about transportation connected with major immigration movements, are 

        likely to attract this audience.</p>

      <h3>International audiences and those with limited skills in reading English</h3>

      <p>The site will reward those who cannot 

        read English language text well, but who learn to navigate and find larger 

        examples of the thumbnail images. The text, written for a general audience, 

        will also be more engaging and will reward the effort of reading. This 

        site is likely to attract an international audience, especially those 

        interested in museums, historic objects, or American history who have 

        previously not accessed NMAH&#146;s on-line exhibitions because of language 

        difficulties. The site will also be welcomed by users with an intellectual 

        disability because the content is complex and interesting to adults but 

        can be accessed with the movement of a mouse. Larger images can be found 

        by responding to thumbprint images, without the need to read captions. 

        </p>

      <b><i><br clear=all>

      </i></b> 

      <h3>Children</h3>

      <p>Some children in grade school will enjoy 

        features of this site, especially the way they can drive it, fast, with 

        something happening visually in response. This evaluation included only 

        one early grade-school girl who was intensely interested in the &#145;Star 

        Spangled Banner&#146; and seemed to read every word. It would be worthwhile 

        to consider a special study of children as audiences for this site, so 

        the site&#146;s educational uses can be enhanced.</p>

      <h3>Collectors, clubs and special interest groups</h3>

      <p>A number of different groups will be 

        drawn by specialist content which is closely related to their leisure 

        or professional occupation and which opens up a resource of information 

        and images not currently available. For example, auctioneers and retailers 

        of antiques and historical objects may use <i>History Wired</i> to make 

        comparisons with their own objects for sale. </p>

      <h2>Contents</h2>

      <h3>Special collections and exhibitions </h3>

      <p>The drop-down menu function gives the 

        possibility of creating special collections as part of <i>History Wired</i>, 

        or featuring new content such as &#145;mystery objects&#146;. These items 

        would attract existing collectors and new audiences. A &#145;collectors&#146; 

        topic could be defined in the drop-down menu, then key words could be 

        used to highlight items as collectors define them; for example coins, 

        stamps, football cards. </p>

      <p>These parts of the site invite the development 

        of discussion groups or on-line &#145;donation&#146; and sharing of images 

        and information. This might also be a location for creating special exhibitions 

        or temporary collections. </p>

      <h3>Dialogue with curators and experts</h3>

      <p>With the current objects, it may be exciting 

        to make available on-line the kind of expert advice from curators and 

        collectors that visitors often seek in the physical museum. For limited 

        periods of time, curators could be available to respond to e-mail questions 

        and comments on particular museum objects. This would be highlighted on 

        the information pages for each object. The interchange between curators 

        and the public would also assist the NMAH to understand how users were 

        engaging with the Museum in new ways through this on-line medium.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p>One of the distinctive qualities of <i>History 

        Wired</i> is the provision of different means to access, view and engage 

        with the large collection of objects. At the same time, there is a consistency 

        of &#145;address&#146; to the reader; one which tries to engage interest 

        in the special stories or features associated with the object. An analysis 

        of the content would have delineated the features of the writing, language 

        , images and their interrelationship that created the possibilities for 

        engagement that were taken up so enthusiastically by audience members.</p>

      <p>Making the different audiences visible 

        in this research has confirmed the importance of the careful work by producers 

        and writers, as well as the significance of the experience that on-line 

        visitors can create from material designed for them. </p>

      <p>Research based on ethnographic approaches 

        promises to contribute more to Web site evaluation than a diagnosis of 

        the functioning of the site and a judgment about whether it is &#145;user 

        friendly&#146;. Attention is paid to the emerging relationships that audiences 

        create in their engagement with the site and its navigational and content 

        possibilities. Relating this activity to the everyday contexts of audiences 

        then suggests new developments such as extending the contents to satisfy 

        specialist interests or to effectively address audiences whose uses were 

        not originally predicted. The focus on audiences constructing meanings 

        leads to interpretation work on-line that creates more extensive use and 

        deeper understanding by Web site users.</p>
