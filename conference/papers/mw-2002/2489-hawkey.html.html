2. Scientists at work - showing what scientists actually do in the process of research. 

3. The status of scientific ideas - scientific ideas as theories or models, rather than as incontrovertible fact or the revelation of truth.

4. Doubt and debate - introducing scope for further questioning and reinterpretation of evidence. 

5. Opportunities for visitors to formulate their own opinions - reflecting the social construction of science. 



The second concentrates on science processes and practices, the methodology and operation of science:

1. Selection of research programmes - realisation that science is neither certain nor neutral means that justification for research is increasingly evident, often expressed as 'biodiversity' or as benefits to humanity

2. Collection and analysis of data - traditional and/or contemporary methods, field and laboratory techniques

3. Evaluation of evidence and its interpretation - a perception of science as unanswered questions rather than unquestioned answers 

4. Development of models, hypotheses and theories - presenting the dynamism and fluidity of science as well as an authoritative view of current understanding

5. Publication, debate and peer review - argument and discussion as key elements of the scientific process

      <p class=Author>Roy Hawkey, The Natural History Museum, London, UK</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The first natural history museum Web sites offered 

        little more than visitor information. Then they began to include more 

        of the nature and scope of both collections and exhibitions. Now, they 

        incorporate sophisticated graphic design and feature active involvement 

        by the virtual visitor, but they can also bring the museums' scientific 

        research work to a larger and more diverse audience. Far from being principally

        - a major concern of most natural history museums. Yet few Web sites explain

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>When it comes to attitudes to science, there is, it appears, no such 

        person as the &#145;average man or woman&#146;. A recent study concluded 

        from extensive sampling that, in the UK, there are indeed six types, from 

        the informed enthusiast to the &#145;not for me&#146; (Wellcome Trust 

        / OST, 2000). Yet, regardless of interest in, aptitude for or knowledge 

        of science, many museum visitors perceive science as a series of facts 

        and laws discovered in laboratories (no doubt by men in white coats) and 

        expressed in difficult technical terminology. They are likely, too, to 

        expect museums to be full of dusty objects supported by the antediluvian 

        opinions of expert curators expressed in obscure language (Hawkey, 2001a).</p>

      <p>Yet, in the Eighteenth Century, museums were central to the active creation 

        of scientific knowledge. At that time museums were centres both for generating 

        scientific understanding through research and for promulgating that understanding, 

        through science education. Resources fundamental to both areas of activity 

        could be drawn from their collections. Ensuing developments, however, 

        resulted in education becoming the province of schools, while science 

        became confined principally to laboratories. Here, experimentation could 

        take place under controlled conditions, with the consequence that museums 

        came to be regarded merely as places for the storage of existing &#150; 

        and potentially ancient &#150; knowledge (Arnold, 1996).</p>

      <p>So, what are natural history museums for? Somewhere to take the children 

        on a wet afternoon? For them to marvel at the dinosaurs? Notions such 

        as these, together with numerous other associated assumptions, are prevalent 

        among the general public, visitors and non-visitors alike. What misconceptions! 

        For, more than any other type of contemporary museum, it is the natural 

        history museums that have maintained the museums&#146; research role. 

        Indeed, unlike most other museums &#150; including, ironically, museums 

        of the physical sciences and of technology &#150; natural history museums 

        are characterized by a high degree of fundamental scientific research. 

        This research activity is reflected in statements, both intentional and 

        incidental, of the aims of natural history museums relating to using collections 

        to make fundamental scientific discoveries about the natural world. For 

        example, The Natural History Museum (UK) has a mission &#145;to maintain 

        and develop its collections and use them to promote the discovery, understanding, 

        responsible use and enjoyment of the natural world&#146; (NHM, 1996).</p>

      <p>Museums per se have such a long-established tradition &#150; the British 

        Museum will shortly celebrate its 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary &#150; 

        that it is easy to over-estimate the age of museum Web sites. Most date 

        from the mid-1990s; many are more recent; all are continuously and rapidly 

        evolving. The early content of natural history museum Web sites did include 

        something of the nature and scope of both collections and exhibitions, 

        but much was essentially visitor information &#150; about opening times, 

        entrance fees and bus routes. There have subsequently, of course, been 

        vast improvements in graphic design and in enhanced functionality, the 

        latter increasingly featuring active involvement by the virtual visitor. 

        Latterly, other developments of great significance have begun to showcase 

        the museums&#146; scientific research work, conveying fundamental ideas 

        about the life and earth sciences to a much larger and more diverse audience.</p>

      <p>A previous paper (Hawkey, 2001b) explored natural history museum Web 

        sites from the perspective of a science teacher, using an embryonic evaluation 

        strategy that, not surprisingly, put great emphasis on educational issues. 

        The present study attempts to develop further such approaches to the analysis 

        and philosophy and practice of Web sites. To some extent it is forced 

        to rely upon an &#145;expert&#146; understanding  of natural history museums 

        and issues in science communication, especially in relation to identifying 

        concepts and strategies that are merely implicit. It may at least provide 

        a foundation for the development of a more sophisticated methodology.</p>

      <p>This paper explores the representation of science on selected natural 

        history museum Web sites. What kind of science is evident? How is it presented 

        (in terms of epistemology rather than aesthetics)? What insights are provided 

        into the underlying philosophy and rationale? Are there indications of 

        the processes of investigation and enquiry or of the interpretation of 

        evidence? What view of scientific knowledge is presented? And, in particular, 

        what efforts are made to explain the contemporary relevance of the science 

        of systematics? </p>

      <h1>Making Science Explicit</h1>

      <p>What, then, do natural history museum Web sites state explicitly about 

        their science? Table 1 shows a number of useful and informative excerpts 

        from several Web sites, in North America, Europe and Australasia. Many 

        of these give great insight into research practice and, occasionally, 

        philosophy. However, the ease with which such material can be located 

        varies considerably, from those where a clear link to &#145;Science&#146; 

        or &#145;Research&#146; is evident on the home page to those who provide 

        little more than annotated lists of departmental organization. This tendency 

        for museums to present themselves as inherently divisional or departmental, 

        often with no more general explanations or evocations, was a greater limiting 

        factor in the choice of museums included in this study than was, for example, 

        language.</p>

        Table 1: Explicit statements of science research policy and practice</p>

      <p>A good example is provided by The Natural History Museum, where departmental 

        designations &#150; Botany, Entomology, Library &amp; Information, Mineralogy, 

        Palaeontology and Zoology &#150; have been augmented, if not superseded, 

        by multi-disciplinary research themes. These are presented in <i>Natural 

        Progression</i> (NHM, 2001a), the Museum&#146;s strategy for science, 

        which is readily available on-line as a downloadable .pdf file: figure 

        1.</p>

      <p>Key elements of scientific enquiry, both process and content, are clearly 

        discernible among the theme descriptors ­&#150; as illustrated in figure 

        2 ­&#150; and are summarized in Table 2). At the next (ie deeper) level, 

        individual projects are highlighted in accessible language (Table 3), 

        but with more sophisticated information and links to further work.</p>

      <h1>Science in the Balance</h1>

      <p>Recent developments in thinking about scientific literacy or the public 

        understanding of science have also given increasing emphasis to the processes 

        and practices of science (House of Lords, 2000). This remains a necessary 

        and critical shift in emphasis, despite the fact that many formal science 

        curricula, such as that in the UK (QCA, 1999), have begun include among 

        their requirements some study of the nature, methodology and operation 

        of science, in addition to an understanding of its knowledge base. </p>

      <p>All of these issues are, to a greater or lesser extent, contained within 

        the research programs of natural history museums. Potentially, at least, 

        they are accessible through the material made available on-line. There 

        are a variety of ways in which issues in this domain can be expressed 

        and annotated. Table 4 shows how King&#146;s (1996) categories compare 

        with those used by Hawkey (2001b), and indicates the synthesis that will 

        be used in what follows in this paper.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="hawkey.table4.jpg" width="450" height="150"><br>

      <h1>Science as a Human Activity</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>How was the universe created? Are birds and dinosaurs 

        related? What makes us human? What are the consequences of human activity 

        on the plants and animals living in our own back yards? These and other 

        deep questions about the natural world are what motivate our scientists 

        each waking hour. (MNH, 2000)</p>

      <p>The human dimension of science is critical in a number of ways, relating 

        not only to who scientists are and what they do but also to which questions 

        society requires them to answer. Presenting science as a social and cultural 

        activity, as a human enterprise, may facilitate enhanced access and help 

        to question the oft-supposed neutrality of science. That science is a 

        human activity (rather than merely pre-determined or abstract) can be 

        reflected to some extent by repetition of &#145;the museum&#146;s scientists&#146;, 

        but is best demonstrated by individualized and personalized narratives. 

        Some Web sites, especially those of the larger US natural history museums, 

        include scientists&#146; names, photographs, case studies and even live 

        links to the field. For example, Chicago&#146;s Field Museum site has 

        on-line exhibits on &#145;<a

href="../http://www.fmnh.org/exhibits/exhibit_sites/wis/default.htm" target="_blank">Women 

        in Science</a>&#146; and on &#145;<a

href="../http://www.fmnh.org/exhibits/exhibit_sites/stories/map/default.htm" target="_blank">Adventures 

        in the Field</a>&#146;.</p>

      <p>Members of the general public have, in recent years increasingly come 

        to question earlier notions that science is inherently beneficial and 

        worthy of support. A heightened realization that science is neither certain 

        nor neutral &#150; especially in its selection of topics for research 

        &#150; has been a significant factor in this. Rationale for research is 

        therefore expected to be explicit, even in apparently non-controversial 

        areas, and natural history museum Web sites are beginning to go some way 

        towards providing this.</p>

      <p>The most likely to be explicitly expressed, and certainly the most frequently 

        highlighted, is &#145;biodiversity&#146;. Although a term little understood 

        by non-specialists and absent from many school science curricula &#150; 

        the National Curriculum in England &amp; Wales (QCA, 1999) has recently 

        introduced &#145;sustainable development&#146;, but &#145;biodiversity&#146; 

        per se is absent - biodiversity is a theme that looms large in the realm 

        of natural history museum Web sites. Natural history museums display a 

        range of examples of biodiversity resources on their Web sites, with explanations 

        that range from the elegiac to the utilitarian, from the moralistic to 

        the homo-centric. Examples are included in table 5.</p>

      <p>Other than biodiversity, the most common rationale given for natural 

        history museum research is the benefits that it can offer to humanity: 

        predicting volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, increasing food supplies, 

        locating oil and gas reserves, maintaining and conserving natural resources. 

        Occasionally, reference is made to economic or commercial considerations 

        &#150; and even, rarely, to sources of funding &#150; but often the goal 

        is expressed simply as that of &#145;better understanding&#146;.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="hawkey.table5.jpg" width="450" height="237"><br>

        Table 5: Examples of rationales for research</p>

      <p>In ways very different from that of fictionalized drama, Web sites can 

        also redress the stereotypical notion and show &#145;that science is not 

        a list of intimidating abstractions in a textbook; it is the imaginative 

        product of personalities who rarely conform to the stereotype of an egghead 

        with a white coat&#146; (Farmelo, 1992).</p>

      <h1>Science as Enquiry</h1>

      <p>The vast majority of natural history museum Web sites include considerable 

        reference to the research activity of their scientists. This may be implicit 

        &#150; implied by terms such as discover, describe, identify, experiment, 

        analyse &#150; or, more rarely, explicit. They inform visitors that scientists 

        collect specimens from all over the world (and beyond, in the case of 

        meteorites,!) and study them using a plethora of techniques. Central to 

        this scientific process is the collection of data and its subsequent analysis, 

        and almost every site includes reference &#150; whether in outline or 

        in detail &#150; to more traditional and/or contemporary methods. Table 

        6 indicates a range of these, divided into predominantly field and laboratory 

        techniques, drawn from a variety of sites.</p>

      <p>Some sites try to give visitors an insight in the enquiry process by 

        involving in what is essentially a role-play activity. One such is QUEST 

        (NHM, 1998). Here, would-be researchers are presented with a series of 

        unidentified objects and a set of virtual tools with which they can magnify 

        the object and look at it from different angles, find out fundamental 

        features, such as mass, size and texture, and gather more sophisticated 

        data including age and an image (if any) under uv light. They then make 

        their own on-line record, with any other observations they may wish (Hawkey, 

        1998, 1999).</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><br>

        Table 6: Methods of data collection and analysis</p>

      <p>There are even examples that encourage active participation in the collection, 

        identification and mapping of organisms such as woodllice (Hawkey, 2002a): 

        figure 4.</p>

        Fig. 4: An Encouragement to go &#145;Walking with Woodlice&#146;</p>

      <h1>Science as Debate</h1>

      <p>Is science presented as unquestioned answers to unanswered questions 

        (AAAS, 1993)? Do natural history museum Web sites expect their virtual 

        visitors simply to collect knowledge or are they encouraged to engage 

        in dialogue leading to understanding? To use a sporting analogy, does 

        the site provide a season ticket or facilitate a free transfer (Hawkey, 

        2002b)?</p>

      <p>Developing visitors&#146; understanding, however simply, of the kinds 

        of questions that scientists ask about evidence &#150; and the ways in 

        which they interpret it &#150; should be a key aim of science communication. 

        However, despite some clear statements of policy, the links between data 

        collection and accepted scientific &#145;knowledge&#146; are often tenuous. 

        Presenting scientific ideas as the best model so far developed introduces 

        scope for further questioning and reinterpretation of evidence. Although 

        many sites explore the scientific research process, there is little evidence 

        of the dynamic interplay between conflicting or competing ideas. Natural 

        history museums as a sector have yet to acquire the confidence to expose 

        the less committed visitor to the issues. The days when barely tolerated, 

        ignorant visitors were expected to be grateful for whatever expert knowledge 

        a curator was prepared to share are, somewhat paradoxically, still with 

        us, at least on some sites. The more committed can, however, find excellent 

        resources, often in the form of on-line essays. With its explicit emphasis 

        on the acquisition of evidence and its subsequent, controversial interpretation, 

        what could be more enthralling than &#145;<a

href="../http://www.nhm.ac.uk/mineralogy/grady/mars.htm" target="_blank">Martian 

        Meteorites, and the search for life on Mars</a>&#146; (Grady, 1999)? </p>

      <p>There are other examples worthy of mention here. The AMNH Web site (<a href="../http://www.amnh.org/" target="_blank">www.amnh.org</a>) 

        includes many narratives about expeditions, but how telling is the admission 

        that those to central Asia in the 1920s, which became crucial to the understanding 

        of dinosaurs (Novacek, 1996), were actually intended to seek out the origins 

        of humans? The new natural history museum of the Netherlands (Naturalis, 

        2001c) includes interesting material, too, that reflects upon the need 

        to re-visit specimens collected 150 years ago, as species are not those 

        attributed at the time. Owen&#146;s original description of <i>Iguanadon</i>&#146;s 

        thumb spike as a horn is well known, as is the discovery that <i>Oviraptor</i>&#146;s 

        name was inappropriately accusatory (NHM, 1997) &#150; but at least the 

        Web sites are not sufficiently arrogant to suggest that misinterpretation 

        was a feature only of the naïve scientists of the past!</p>

      <h1>Science as Model Making</h1>

      <p>Clarifying the status of scientific ideas as theories or models &#150; 

        rather than as incontrovertible fact or the revelation of truth &#150; 

        can lead to a different view of scientific understanding. However, as 

        Durant (1992) has observed of science museums in general, much of the 

        material that is easily accessible on natural history museum Web sites 

        (ie relatively few clicks from the home page) rather gives the impression 

        that science is &#145;the sure and solid mastery of nature&#146;. It is 

        not that there are no reflective and discursive approaches, but that they 

        tend to be rather deeper in the site.</p>

      <p>Despite some attempts to indicate &#145;how we know&#146; or &#145;what 

        we do not yet understand&#146;, the majority of natural history museum 

        Web sites do present science as a fixed body of knowledge. This is, in 

        essence, little different from the perspective of their Nineteenth cCntury 

        counterparts &#150; the transmission of the curators&#146; expert knowledge 

        to an ignorant public. The challenge for museums is to present the dynamism 

        and fluidity of science as well as an authoritative view of current understanding 

        (Hawkey, 2001a). For those prepared to delve deeply, there are alternative 

        insights. In many ways parallel to the discussion of life on Mars &#150; 

        and even more difficult to find &#150; is Stringer&#146;s (1999) essay, 

        entitled &#145;<a href="../http://www.nhm.ac.uk/palaeontology/v&amp;a/cbs/ancestors.html" target="_blank">Were 

        the Neanderthals Our Ancestors?</a>&#146; Although also concerned with 

        evidence, this provides lively access to the nature and status of scientific 

        ideas.</p>

      <p>Other insights that could, given an appropriate treatment, really raise 

        visitors&#146; awareness of the changing status of scientific thinking 

        are to be found on a number of sites &#150; but often buried without further 

        interpretation in the &#145;science for scientists&#146; pages. For example, 

        the Copenhagen Zoological Museum (2001) reports its Biosystematics Centre 

        as having discovered and described two new animal phyla, re-evaluated 

        hypotheses about gradients of species richness and produced a phylogenetic 

        analysis of a new mammal species. All new ideas, overturning the old order.</p>

      <h1>Science and Society</h1>

      <p>Non-scientists &#150; and, especially, the media &#150; frequently express 

        surprise when scientists disagree. And yet, whether or not one takes a 

        Kuhnian view of paradigm shifts, argument, discussion and debate are essential 

        components of the scientific process. Given the inherently interactive 

        nature of the Web as a medium of communication, it is perhaps surprising 

        that there are few examples of facilitating dialogue on museum Web sites, 

        and certainly very few that empower visitors to formulate and contribute 

        their own opinions. However, this is an increasing practice in the science 

        centre sector &#150; although not necessarily on their Web sites &#150; 

        and this may be expected eventually to have an impact.</p>

      <p>There are rare examples of Web resources that allow visitors to share 

        findings and ideas. One such is <i>QUEST</i>, significant among whose 

        features is an on-line notebook. This provides access to this aspect of 

        science &#150; discussion and debate &#150; that is all too often absent 

        from conventional science resources, and certainly is rarely included 

        as a significant component of formal education (Hawkey, 2000). Certainly, 

        if the museums of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century are to be places for exploration 

        and learning through discovery where &#150; rather than provide all the 

        answers &#150; exhibits should be interactive and stimulate the visitor 

        to ask questions (Abungu, 1999), then how much more should this be true 

        of museum Web sites.</p>

      <h1>Systematically Speaking: The Science of Systematics</h1>

      <p>Science has a limited number of classical and iconic representations, 

        paramount among which are the Bunsen burner and the test-tube, while people&#146;s 

        awareness of science is often limited to the kind of practical, experimental 

        work undertaken in laboratories. Although many apparently traditional 

        laboratories may indeed be found in natural history museums, undertaking 

        work of this type (especially in microbiology and in earth sciences), 

        there are many other important aspects of science for which such a popular 

        caricature is quite inappropriate. Principal among these is systematics, 

        a major concern &#150; indeed, the <i>raison d&#146;être</i> &#150; of 

        most natural history museums: &#147;In the progress of naming organisms 

        and studying their relationships, systematists collect many specimens. 

        Therefore, natural history museum collections as we know them came into 

        being along with the science of systematics.&#148; (California Academy 

        of Sciences, 2000).Fig. 5: An invitation to the Pritzker laboratory</p>

      <p>An excellent example of a contemporary natural history museum laboratory 

        is provided by the <u><a

href="../http://www.fieldmuseum.org/research_collections/pritzker_lab/pritzker/index.html" target="_blank">Pritzker</a></u> 

        laboratory at Chicago&#146;s Field Museum, a &#145;core facility dedicated 

        to genetic analysis and preservation of the world&#146;s biodiversity&#146; 

        (Field Museum, 2000a). The Field Museum&#146;s Pritzker Laboratory is 

        a non-departmental multi-user core facility dedicated to genetic analysis 

        and preservation of the world&#146;s biodiversity. It is shared by Field 

        Museum curators, staff members and associated outside collaborators who 

        constitute together one of the most diverse groups of evolutionary biologists 

        and systematists in the world. The lab provides researchers with state-of-the-art 

        equipment in molecular biology, enabling them to pursue the study of genetic 

        diversity throughout the tree of life and at all taxonomic levels, from 

        relationships among populations to classes and phyla of organisms. </p>

      <p>Systematics is the science involved in the discovery, description, naming 

        and classification of living and fossil organisms and the elucidation 

        of their evolutionary relationships. It therefore encompasses taxonomy, 

        the naming and classification of fossil and living species, although the 

        two terms are often used as if they were synonyms (UK Systematics Forum, 

        1998). Although it constitutes a fundamental area of study in all natural 

        history museum research, relatively few Web sites make it explicit &#150; 

        and even fewer explain systematics in detail or underline its significance. 

        Those that do, however, give valuable insights into the nature of the 

        scientific study of the natural world. As has been mentioned earlier, 

        The Natural History Museum&#146;s Web site identifies &#145;systematics 

        and evolution&#146; as one of its key research themes.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="hawkey.table7.jpg" width="450" height="136"><br>

href="../http://www.fieldmuseum.org/research_collections/zoology/zoo_sites/peet" target="_blank">Partnerships 

        for Enhancing Expertise in Taxonomy</a>&#146; &#150; features not only 

        the nature and value of the scientific work, but also the impending shortage 

        of suitably skilled scientists (Field Museum, 2000b):</p>

      <p class=Blockquote>The accelerating loss of biological diversity in the 

        world, through habitat destruction, pollution, and ecosystem fragmentation, 

        has been accompanied by a loss of taxonomic experts who are trained to 

        discover, identify, describe, and classify the world&#146;s organismal 

        diversity. Retirement of taxonomic specialists, shifts in academic recruitment 

        and staffing, and reductions in graduate training have conjoined to impede 

        biodiversity research and conservation, particularly on large but poorly 

        known groups such as bacteria, fungi, protists, and numerous marine and 

        terrestrial invertebrates. Vast numbers of species in understudied &#147;invisible&#148; 

        groups constitute critical elements of food chains and ecosystems, both 

        aquatic and terrestrial, but the high proportion of unrecognized species 

        in these groups limits research and progress in many areas of biology 

        and conservation. </p>

      <p>This impending difficulty was also highlighted by an earlier UK parliamentary 

        study (House of Lords, 1992) that bemoaned the absence of systematics 

        from formal education courses. Recent discussions (QCA, 2002) have indicated 

        that this omission is being addressed, although it will be several years 

        before any changes can take effect.</p>

      <h1>Summary</h1>

      <p>Despite a number of exceptions such as those exemplified in this paper, 

        the majority of natural history museum Web sites have yet to realize the 

        opportunity to bring their approaches to science and science communication 

        into the modern age. All too often science is presented only as &#145;revealed 

        truth&#146; and communication as a one-directional transmission. The potential 

        of the Internet for museums to truly share their passion for science, 

        especially the less fashionable areas such as systematics, is clear. That 

        such an opportunity coincides with changes in views about the public understanding 

        of science and about the role of museums (both already evident) makes 

        it an opportunity not be missed. Natural history museum Web sites already 

        provide an extensive resource, but many have some way to go before they 

        are likely to go beyond informing the previously informed or enthusing 

        the already enthusiastic. Most of all, they need to put less emphasis 

        on their own internal organization and rather more on exploring the fundamental 

        principles of science. </p>
