Originally developed by Xerox Corporation as a compression scheme to efficiently combine different compression requirements for text and image content in scanned digital documents, MRC is for the first time being deployed to the compression of non-compound documents.

Used in conjunction with the new JPEG 2000 compression standard, MRC enables not only image compression but also the accurate discrimination of printed intaglio lines from finishing work in colored prints, paving the way for separate processing of each.  Whereas other compression models treat the formal content of an image as invariant, MRC is sensitive to the heterogeneous character of the pictorial composition as a whole.  By treating printed (engraved and/or etched) lines separately from colored image layers, MRC minimizes image degradation and the inevitable loss of information.  The result is superior raster imagery: digital facsimiles that show exceptional fidelity to their prototypes, as a comparison between an original scan of one of Blake's commercial print illustrations and its MRC reconstruction makes evident.  Because applied segmentation can essentially lift the color overlay of an impression, it additionally provides the student of Blake the unique opportunity to recreate the underlying copperplate image and model the artist's coloring process.

      <p class=PaperTitle><b>Digital Representation and Compression of William 

        Blake&#146;s Hand-Colored Engravings</b></p>

      <p class=Author><b>Vladimir Misic, Kari Kraus<sup>, </sup>University of 

        Rochester, NY, USA</b></p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle><b>Abstract</b></p>

      <p class=AbstractText>This paper demonstrates and discusses the application 

        of Mixed Raster Content (MRC) compression scheme to digital reproductions 

        of William Blake&#146;s hand-colored etchings and engravings.  Although 

        Blake is our focus, much of what we have to say and show can be extrapolated 

        to cover the graphic arts more generally.  MRC, for example, has the potential 

        to transform the way we study and represent different states of an engraved 

        plate, and consequently could help retool the genre of the catalogue raisonne 

        for the digital age.  More broadly, it is our feeling that the image processing 

        advances presented here will be of interest to humanists working in a 

        variety of image-intensive areas and disciplines, ranging from art history 

        to conservation science to editorial theory.  Although we want to underscore 

        the versatility of the technology, the paper takes a case study approach, 

        considering the achievement of MRC within the history of Blake reproduction 

        and editing. </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Keywords: image representation, Mixed Raster Content, 

        William Blake, colored engravings</p>

      <h1><b>Historical Background and Editorial Significance</b></h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Like other etchings and engravings of his day, many 

        of Blake&#146;s commercial and artistic prints are analyzable into discrete 

        media, each of which corresponds to a different stage of the production 

        process.  An impression from an early copy of <i><span>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</span></i>, for example, has its 

        genesis in a copperplate; assuming we are looking at an original, the 

        image we encounter on paper comprises lines printed from the relief-etched 

        metal, overlaid by tints and pen-and-ink work.  Because we tend to view 

        the end result as an artistic and indissoluble whole, these different 

        layers of codes&#151;mixed-method etched and engraved lines, large tonal 

        areas, and ink applied with pen or brush to reinforce the composition 

        or add detail&#151;can often be difficult for the naked eye to detect, 

        especially if one is consulting a photomechanical reproduction.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>In the context of a thumbnail typology of Blake reproductions, 

        MRC may be described as an algorithmic solution to analyzing, compressing, 

        and representing the formal layers of Blake&#146;s etchings and engravings.  

        The complex problem of accurately segmenting the image&#151;until now 

        a technological challenge confronted primarily by hand facsimilists of 

        Blake&#151;is for the first time being taken up by digital facsimilists, 

        pointing to shared goals and a new convergence of interests among those 

        working with competing models of reproduction.   </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The achievement of MRC can be evaluated to some extent 

        by considering the lengths previous Blake editors have had to go to reconstruct 

        the artist&#146;s graphic experiments on metal.  Most of Blake&#146;s 

        copperplates are now untraceable, said to have been sold as scrap metal 

        in the second half of the nineteenth century by a servant of an unnamed 

        gentleman&#151;this according to scuttlebutt.  Among the etched illuminated 

        books, only a small copper fragment from <i><span>America</span></i> (1793) has survived.  Some of the 

        commercial engravings have fared slightly better: the single large plate 

        for <i><span>The Canterbury Pilgrims</span></i> (1810) is extant, 

        as are the 22 plates for the <i><span>Illustrations of the Book of Job</span></i> (c. 1825) 

        and the seven unfinished plates for Dante&#146;s <i><span>Inferno</span></i> (1827). </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Lacking the opportunity to pull posthumous impressions 

        from Blake&#146;s original copperplates, modern editors have sought to 

        conjecturally restore the underlying image, sometimes relying on scientifically 

        sound methods to do so, other times putting their faith in smoke and mirrors. 

        These conjectures are nothing if not the product of great industry; over 

        time they&#146;ve involved the creation of monochrome washes to speculatively 

        define form; monochrome printing from photographs of colored impressions; 

        consultation of uncolored copies of Blake&#146;s etchings; examination 

        of embossed impressions, whose raised designs are a function of the relief-etched 

        plate having been subjected to unusual printing pressure; and the use 

        of electrotypes of an older set made from Blake&#146;s original plates 

        prior to their historical vanishing act.  There is a striking editorial 

        tale lurking in the diversity of this list, which encapsulates more than 

        a century&#146;s worth of efforts to restore Blake&#146;s copplerplate 

        outlines.  Into this imaginative mix arrives MRC, bringing the latest 

        signal processing advances to bear on a historical endeavor.</p>

      <h1><b>How MRC Works </b></h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Documents in the WBA capture Blake&#146;s combination 

        of engraving/etching and coloring of picture and text.  In the technical 

        idiom these documents would be described as compound images, a common 

        form of document representation.  Because compound images contain both 

        text and continuous-tone images, they are difficult to compress efficiently 

        (the human visual system works differently for text and pictures) by any 

        of the common compression methods.  For that reason, MRC uses a multi-layered 

        imaging model and applies multiple compression algorithms to compress 

        these layers.  Compared to traditional compression schemes (JPEG, GIF, 

        TIFF, etc.), MRC enables more flexibility in adjusting to the given document 

        type, resulting in better quality of the reproduced images and text&#151;measured 

        as document distortion after decompression.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Without hard mathematics, MRC can be described as: 

        Image = BackgroundLayer * ForegroundLayer, where the symbol * denotes 

        inter-layer interaction.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Applied to the WBA&#146;s documents (see Fig. 1), MRC, 

        as previously stated, entails the separation not of image and text, but 

        of etched (Fig. 2) and colored (Fig. 3) parts of the image and the individual 

        compression of each.  The image is then recreated using the MRC imaging 

        model (Fig. 4).  You might say that MRC mimics the sequence of the original 

        imaging process: printing the etched lines first, Blake or someone else 

        later painted the colored layer over them.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>One can see the dramatic difference when comparing 

        the quality of compression achieved by MRC against that of other standard 

        compression formats, at the enlarged scale (zoomed image).  The JPEG compressed 

        images show blocking effects (smearing and discoloring) while both JPEG 

        and JPEG2000 compressed images completely drop engraved lines in some 

        areas.  At the same time modified MRC preserves (but somewhat smears) 

        the lines in the same image areas where other algorithms fail (Fig. 5).<br>

      <h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Originally developed by Xerox Corporation as a compression 

        scheme to efficiently combine different compression requirements for text 

        and image content in scanned digital documents, MRC is for the first time 

        being deployed to the compression of non-compound documents.  Unlike the 

        first installment of the technology, which was a response to composite 

        text and image data, the version of MRC being presented here is designed 

        with the inherent compositeness of colored prints and other graphic media 

        in mind.  The documents we are dealing with, then, are still &#147;compound&#148; 

        in the broader, non-technical sense of the term, but the semiological 

        analysis is performed entirely at the level of the image, exclusive of 

        a consideration of text.  </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Used in conjunction with the new JPEG 2000 compression 

        standard, MRC enables not only image compression but also the accurate 

        discrimination of printed intaglio lines from finishing work in colored 

        prints, paving the way for separate processing of each.  Whereas other 

        compression models treat the formal content of an image as invariant, 

        MRC is sensitive to the heterogeneous character of the pictorial composition 

        as a whole.  By treating printed (engraved and/or etched) lines separately 

        from colored image layers, MRC minimizes image degradation and the inevitable 

        loss of information.  The result is superior raster imagery: digital facsimiles 

        that show exceptional fidelity to their prototypes, as a comparison between 

        an original scan of one of Blake&#146;s commercial print illustrations 

        and its MRC reconstruction makes evident.  Because applied segmentation 

        can essentially lift the color overlay of an impression, it additionally 

        provides the student of Blake the unique opportunity to recreate the underlying 

        copperplate image and model the artist&#146;s coloring process.  </p>

      <h1><b>Workshop presentation preview</b></h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>From a visual standpoint, the presentation will unfold 

        with (first) a brief look at pre-digital efforts to split Blake&#146;s 

        tones/colors from his edges/lines.  Using a detail from a plate engraved 

        by Blake after a design by John Stedman for the latter&#146;s Narrative 

        of a Five Years&#146; Expedition, Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam 

        (1806), we will then compare the quality of compression achieved by MRC 

        against that of other standard compression formats.  The examples will 

        show the advantages of MRC when used cooperatively with wavelet compression.  

        We will close with some speculations about what a next-generation version 

        of MRC might be able to do: an ambitious agenda would include extending 

        the ability of MRC to automatically or semi-automatically distinguish 

        etched from engraved lines or detect intaglio lines in an impression that 

        has been color-printed from the plate&#146;s surfaces. </p>
