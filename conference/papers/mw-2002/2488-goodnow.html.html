      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The Iziko museums in Cape Town, South Africa in collaboration 

        with the International Museums Studies Programme at the University of 

        Bergen, Norway, have jointly developed a web-based concept that combines 

        oral storytelling with new technology to connect schools in the South 

        and North. Awaiting funding, this project will be trail tested later this 

        year.</p>

      <h1>The Iziko Project</h1>

      <p>In 2001 and 2002 the Iziko Museums of Cape Town and the International 

        Museums Program in Bergen, Norway developed and trial tested a web-based 

        museums project which draws on the skills and narrative structures of 

        South African traditional storytelling. This paper, in addition to describing 

        the particular strategies that have been chosen for this township project, 

        offers also a background to the need for new forms of representation in 

        South African museums and new relationships between museums, townships 

        and a more diverse audience. The project involves the use of a mobile 

        van in collaboration with community centres and satellite museums in outer 

        urban and rural centres. Stories by children as well as adults are collected 

        through digital video and disseminated through handheld devices (PDA&#146;s) 

        as well as through the web to computers in collaborating schools, museums 

        and community groups within South Africa and overseas.</p>

      <p>The paper begins with a brief history of museums, representation and 

        segregation in Cape Town - a necessary background to understand the need 

        to create new stories and reach new audiences also through the use of 

        new technologies.</p>

      <h2>A short history of the museum</h2>

      <p>In Cape Town, before 1962, the major museum - The South African Museum 

        - housed both the natural history and the cultural history collections. 

        It lies in the centre of town in what was, and in many ways still remains, 

        a white area due to economic segregation that includes institutions such 

        as the National Gallery, The National Library and Provincial Government 

        parliament buildings, institutions that only recently were open to black 

        and mixed audiences as the majority of these facilities were designated 

        for whites only under South Africa&#146;s apartheid system. </p>

      <p>The Museum of South Africa was, as such - an exception amongst these 

        institutions. However, the placement of the museum in the city centre 

        ensured that the museum remained a white-only entity. This vision of the 

        museum as a segregated space remains as one of the major challenges facing 

        South African museums. The geographical placement of the museums are also 

        compounded by the fact that the representations of black and white history 

        have changed little since the apartheid system was abolished in the 1990&#146;s. 

        The reasons for this are partly economic - with major funding going to 

        challenges within health, welfare and housing - and partly related to 

        a lack of new curatorial staff to force through major changes. Returning 

        to history, black and white cultural history were further segregated in 

        1962 when a decision was made to move the cultural history collections 

        to a separate building while natural history including ethnography, and 

        therefore black cultural history, remained at the initial site. This split 

        was reinforced by a political decision to place the cultural history collections 

        under the governance of &quot;white own affairs&quot; (Davidson, 2001) 

        .</p>

      <p>The layout of the cultural history collections were further reinforced 

        this split been white and black history. The exhibition was increasingly 

        organised such that the viewer would walk through the collections in a 

        seemingly &#145;natural&#146; pattern - from the Ancient civilisations 

        of Greece and Egypt through to Europe, particularly Northern Europe, and 

        finally to colonised CapeTown. This organisation, through default, meant 

        that African history, with the exception of colonial history, did not 

        play a part in the formation of modern day Cape Town. In the original 

        museum, today&#146;s South African Museum, a predominantly natural history 

        museum, the ethnographic collections were organised around the dual desires 

        of classification of material cultures, tribes, types of weapons etc. 

        - and that of documenting an authentic African rural life before it became 

        tainted by industrial developments.</p>

      <p>Representations of black culture were, and in many ways still are, in 

        line with European ideas of the noble but primitive tribesman. Many of 

        the images of the natives were timeless and idyllic. Plaster casts were 

        made of tribal people carrying out traditional activities. These casts 

        were then often placed in agricultural settings. They suggested produce 

        and activity rather than hardship or effort. Family groupings, often mother-child 

        compositions portrayed the notion of social cohesion. These were images 

        that supported the arguments of those who sought a solution for South 

        African in racial segregation (Goodby, 2001). Left alone, the black population 

        was a proud and self-contained nation.</p>

      <p>Other images, and plaster-casts, were oriented towards titillating a 

        white audience. Plaster-casts were made of hunters, reinforcing the image 

        and stereotype of the savage. These plaster-casts were placed in a diorama 

        which initially could be seen only through peep-holes. This experience 

        allowed the white viewer close contact with the &#145;dangers&#146; of 

        black Africa but ensured a safe distance behind the glass and with only 

        one way viewing. This diorama was closed down in the year 2000 to the 

        outrage of local audiences and tour operators. Tour operators, in fact, 

        threatened to stop bringing tourists, who in the current economic climate 

        were vital to the museums income, unless the rest of the ethnographic 

        section remained as it was with its offerings of &#145;real&#146; tribesmen 

        (Lohman, 2001).</p>

      <p>The reality of life amongst tribal groups during the time of the collecting 

        of this material was in fact largely different. Traditional tribal land 

        and the Reserves, where much of the anthropological material was gathered, 

        were heavily effected by integration and urban change - not the least 

        through the movement of labour, predominantly male, to mining camps and 

        urban centres where labour was needed. This form of social history was 

        not portrayed in the museum context, and the current collections and exhibitions 

        are still heavily influenced by the attempts of capturing &#145;authentic&#146; 

        black history. </p>

      <p>For the anthropologists at the museum this need to &#145;capture&#146; 

        black cultural history before it changed was understandable and similar 

        activities have been made elsewhere. The problem here was the lack of 

        inclusion of more contemporary social history such as the effect of mining 

        and segregation. Like many post-colonial societies, professional and amateur 

        anthropologists and missionaries were often the only groups in a position 

        to gather and document these material cultures and histories in a manner 

        that was acceptable and understandable for broader audiences. As such 

        these collections have value. However, the stories they tell do not fully 

        encompass the histories of the people they represent.</p>

      <p>One problem facing museums today is that little alternative documentation 

        has been collected. Historians can easily find documents and artefacts 

        of officers and industrialists, but few voices or images remain from early 

        or mid-colonisation. However, many cultures, including indigenous Australians 

        and African cultures, argue quite rightly, that their histories, if not 

        material cultures, have been preserved through other manners of documentation 

        - through for example oral cultures including ceremonies, song, dance 

        and storytelling. These stories, and this manner of documenting history, 

        remain problematic within traditional concepts of history and science 

        and the need for historical certainty.</p>

      <p>A number of situations have arisen in post-colonial societies in which 

        the value of these stories have had to be reviewed. Land Rights claims 

        have led to an introduction of storytelling within the legal apparatus. 

        Museums also are increasingly including storytelling not simply as a manifestation 

        of cultural output but as a possible source for historic fact. This desire 

        to reconsider the role of storytelling has led to a number of changes 

        in the museums of Cape Town. One manifestation of this is in the change 

        of name of the Cape Townian museums to the Iziko Museums of Cape Town. 

        Iziko means the hearth around which stories are told. Another manifestation 

        is in the desire to consider how various forms of storytelling can be 

        incorporated into the museum environment and be disseminated to a wider 

        audience - such as in the storytelling and the Web project to be described 

        here.</p>

      <h2>Centre-periphery relations</h2>

      <p>A further piece of background needs to be added before entering the specifics 

        of the storytelling project. To understand the need to move both the collection 

        of material and the dissemination of the stories and exhibitions, the 

        geographical lay-out into which the project is placed needs to be understood. 

        Again there is a need to provide some historical background. </p>

      <p>Cape Town today is geographically effected by the apartheid system of 

        the 20th century which was reinforced through Western concepts of urban 

        planning. Urban planners in South Africa were particularly interested 

        in Corbusier&#146;s ideas of the modern city and, as was the case in many 

        colonies, European intellectual ideas often found a greater foothold there 

        than in their home countries. This foothold was supported both by a lack 

        of contestation as well as political might to carry through the changes. 

        For Cape Town urban renewal in the height of apartheid meant the creation 

        of the &#145;white&#146; city centre through the demolition of inner-city 

        suburbs and forced removal of the inhabitants. This &#145;planning&#146; 

        or demolition effected particularly inner-city suburbs that were deemed 

        racially mixed - such as District Six. The inhabitants of these districts 

        were moved to the outer-lying Cape flats according to their designated 

        colour. The apartheid system included 15 different categories of colour 

        and race of which only one was white.</p>

      <p>The townships of Cape Town surrounding the economic centre, grew in part 

        through this forced removal, and in part through the arrival of rural 

        populations for work purposes. The townships are only a 20-minute drive 

        from the centre of town however there is comparatively little traffic 

        between the two sites. For many white South Africans, many of the townships 

        are deemed too dangerous, and for the large majority of township inhabitants 

        the journey to the centre of town, is too costly and therefore seldom 

        made, unless employment is there - such as the case of many domestic helps. 

        Trips for purely entertainment reasons or education such as a museum visit, 

        would be highly unusual for many township inhabitants. It is important 

        to note, however, that the different townships include a diversity of 

        inhabitants, with some townships populated by emerging middle-class social 

        groups. The most populated townships include predominantly economically 

        disadvantaged groups and it is to these that references are being made.</p>

      <p>One of the major questions then for the Iziko Museums is how to reach 

        out to these audiences. One, fairly traditional way of ensuring a broader 

        visitor segment, is through bussing of school groups to the centre of 

        town and Iziko has a relatively active educational program including transport 

        solutions. This fills a stop-gap need however more long-term solutions 

        need to be sought.</p>

      <h2>New audiences and new museum structures</h2>

      <p>A variety of ways of serving these communities have been considered including 

        mobile museums, collaboration with newly established community centres, 

        and the construction of permanent satellite museums. Each type of entity 

        raises a particular set of issues to be worked out before even considering 

        the inclusion and use of new technologies.</p>

      <p>For politicians and local government satellite museums are seen as continuing 

        the role museums have traditionally had i.e. educating the populace particularly 

        in the areas of science - an area which local teachers have little resources 

        to do properly. The driving thought here, in the South African scenario, 

        is that the museum experience will encourage local youth to remain in 

        school. Within this perspective the museum is seen as serving local audiences. 

        However, in the current economic climate in South Africa, museums are 

        expected to be self-sustaining and local audiences are not financially 

        situated to cover these costs. Therefore the museums must also reach out 

        to the tourist market as well. Local science education at a primary level 

        and promoting tourism sit together uncomfortably but is part of the mandate 

        as seen by a particularly important set of gatekeepers and one that needs 

        to be addressed in any proposed project. New technology in this scenario 

        would then be divided - in part covering local education needs and in 

        part disseminating information to visitors and tourists.</p>

      <p>Community groups themselves are divided over the issue of the role of 

        satellite or community-based museums. For some the community centre or 

        satellite museum should ensure local employment and support local industry 

        in a variety of ways including the sale of local produce, attracting tourism, 

        and employment within the museum/centre. This leads to a view of the foreigner 

        as the primary audience for the museum rather than the local population 

        with the content of the museum being a representation of local culture 

        for the enjoyment or education of others. In this scenario new technology 

        will primarily have the role of broadcasting local culture to others.</p>

      <p>For other sections of the local community, and for museum staff, cultural 

        heritage is primary. The collection of material culture is seen, by museum 

        staff, as a continuation of core work. Cultural heritage involves both 

        presentation of local materials to the tourist market as has been done 

        previously at the original museum, both within limited exhibitions and 

        through the museum shop, but it is also seen as the instillation of pride 

        in local history and material culture amongst local audiences.</p>

      <p>This goal is approached not only through the presentation of local cultures 

        and social history but also through participation in the creation of the 

        centre. This is not a new approach. Indigenous participation has been 

        discussed by many museums particularly since the 1978 UNESCO seminar<i> 

        Preserving Indigenous Cultures: A New Role for Museums</i>. Participation 

        has moved from simple consultation in the preparation of exhibitions by 

        settler curators to active training of indigenous curators, inclusion 

        on administrative boards and clear guidelines regarding consultation at 

        all stages of exhibition planning. New technology in this scenario should 

        then be used not only in the gathering and dissemination of local information 

        by traditional museum staff but also involve local communities on a variety 

        of levels including the creation of exhibition materials.</p>

      <h1>Iziko stories</h1>

      <p>With this variety of gatekeepers (and sponsors have not been included 

        though they have a set of criteria of their own), the project in focus, 

        Iziko stories, chose a route that involved cultural heritage and speaking 

        to both local and foreign audiences. Education was met through children 

        and community groups use of new media as well as through oral histories. 

        More on this below. Local participation was also primary both through 

        consultation as well as  &#145;curating&#146; the project itself. The 

        project was developed both for use within a satellite museum or community 

        centre as well as within a mobile museum framework. </p>

      <p>The major question arising out of the mobile museum framework was the 

        extent to which continuity could be maintained. Local community groups 

        asked, quite rightly, what a mobile museum would leave behind. Continuity 

        after the mobile museum left became then another variable to be addressed 

        through the use of new technology.</p>

      <p>Networking was a further issue. Traditional museums and simple satellite 

        museum structures were likely to continue centre-periphery structures. 

        An argument was made that rural connectivity was as important as that 

        of centre-periphery contact. This is a similar argument as that made for 

        the development of community media and the use of satellites to connect 

        rural areas to each other rather than simply disseminate information from 

        the centre to outlying rural areas (Molnar and Meadows, 2001).</p>

      <h2>Storytelling</h2>

      <p>The audience for the project became similar local audiences, centre audiences 

        as well as foreign audiences. To find a universal element amongst these 

        groups and to ensure interaction and equivalent input, a decision was 

        made that a common element to all these groups was that of stories. Storytelling 

        had the further advantage of being a central part in the culture of the 

        local groups participating in the project. </p>

      <p>Oral transmission of history was well developed in Africa over centuries. 

        In part this is due to a lack of written record-keeping as, with the exception 

        of Egypt, Ethiopia and the Buman, Vai and Akan peoples, there were few 

        written cultures developed on the African continent (Ukadike, 1993). Information, 

        history and cultural mores were passed on primarily through song and spoken 

        word through a variety of ceremonies, family gatherings, royal courts, 

        festivals and rites of passage. A rich cultural history was developed 

        in this manner. Social history was furthermore recorded and kept alive 

        through this manner. </p>

      <p>The arrival of colonisers threatened the survival of this oral tradition 

        as Frank Ukadike argues:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Under colonial domination, new values initiated by Western 

        ideologies were introduced into African life, and under neo-colonialism, 

        Africa struggled - and is still struggling - to develop distinct national 

        cultures. ... The European presence brought with it an onslaught of alien 

        influences from industrial nations, that is, the &#145;western way of 

        life&#146;, yet this and endemic natural disasters such as drought, famine, 

        and disease never entirely destroyed the tenacity of the old order. <i><br>

        <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Ukadike, 1993, p.22)</span></i></p>

      <p>Using traditional oral structures does not mean that one is essentialising 

        local populations. It is simply offering a framework that is understood 

        both by local and overseas audiences. Using a high level of audio-visual 

        material, and drawing on traditional storytelling forms, also meant that 

        it would be well received by a variety of local audiences. Keyan Tomaselli, 

        a South African filmmaker, argues that this strategy is also used by African 

        filmmakers:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Africa is still comprised of people who exhibit varying 

        cultures of orality, semi-literacy and total literacy. As such, African 

        directors often find themselves interfacing between oral and literate 

        worlds. ... Orality helps explain their episodic, often disjointed, lateral 

        narratives, which break with Hollywood linear conventions of beginning, 

        middle and end. <i><br>

        <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Siyolwe, 2002)</span></i></p>

      <p>This disjointedness also worked well within the hypertext structures 

        of interactive narratives on the web or CD-rom. Both here and in traditional 

        African storytelling situations, storytellers can, and are, often interrupted 

        in the telling of the tale. Unlike conventional Western narratives, African 

        stories can take divergent paths depending on the audiences reaction and 

        interaction. While computer games and the Internet have promoted amongst 

        youth, used to these forms of technologies, an acceptance of interactive 

        narrative - one that would be less expected and accepted if it were disseminated 

        through video or television. Like current interactive narratives, however, 

        the paths to be taken are not unlimited, the storyteller - the griot - 

        still decides the limitations of the possible paths. This was important 

        also as the stories were to appeal to a wider audience and in as much 

        as they were to carry an important message of rewriting learnt history 

        and readdressing previously ingrained stereotypes of African people.</p>

      <p>The storytellers approached in the project involved both elders who could 

        pass on particular views of history and stories that are not included 

        in the mainstream educational curriculum, as well as youth who would be 

        encouraged to create new stories from their own experiences. Ideally the 

        storytelling process is an exchange between children in South Africa and 

        children overseas and in the initial development children in the Nordic 

        countries, particularly Norway, have been targeted. The goal here was 

        to enable children to promote and exchange cultural traditions through 

        storytelling, encouraging both exploration of their own cultural identities 

        formed by urbanisation and cross-cultural influences as well as traditional 

        practices. Promoting storytelling also met the need of motivation for 

        learning and communicating through new media. </p>

      <h1>Workshops and PHAKAMA</h1>

      <p>New media would be a tool to be used in conjunction with workshops in 

        which children would develop skills in, and knowledge of, storytelling. 

        The workshops facilitate processes in which children learn, through a 

        variety of media, to develop critical and investigative skills. </p>

      <p>The project drew on the skills of an established community group that 

        ran storytelling workshops - PHAKAMA. PHAKAMA is an organisation working 

        already with cross-cultural theatre and storytelling projects in Great 

        Britain, India and South Africa. PHAKAMA has broad experience bringing 

        together from the Black, Asian, Cape Coloured and Afrikaans communities 

        in Cape Town with communities in Britain - however not as yet through 

        the use of new media. PHAKAMA uses local craftsmen and women across media 

        to assist in running the workshops so as to enable a continuity of practice 

        after the workshop is held and the initial organisers have moved on. These 

        local craftsmen and women are often attached to local community groups 

        or to schools. The Iziko Stories draws on these experiences and organisation.  

      </p>

      <p>The storytelling workshops are organised around everyday, iconic images 

        available across cultures - such as a shoe. These images give the children, 

        in groups or individually, a starting point they can relate to for their 

        stories. The children are then encouraged to create fictional characters 

        with a relationship to the image so as to allow for a necessary distance 

        to reality. At the same time, however, the choice of everyday items meant 

        that the stories reflected, most often, their intimate personal experiences 

        as they are written within their sphere of knowledge. Through stories 

        and the objects, the children communicate who they are and what occupies 

        their daily life. The choice of a common icon facilitates the communication 

        process and identification of children across borders. The children are 

        taught how to act out these stories within traditional African storytelling 

        forms - including performance, dance, music and painting. The stories 

        are also written in a branching mode to allow for later viewer interaction.</p>

      <p>A mobile unit complete with trained professionals arrive at the site 

        at the end of the week of the workshops. These professionals have a set 

        of digital equipment to record the children&#146;s stories and performances. 

        Children are shown how the recording and editing of their stories takes 

        place. The children also receive and view stories from other parts of 

        South Africa and from overseas through a map exhibition.</p>

      <h2>Map exhibition</h2>

      <p>An integral part of the project is a large walk-on map exhibition that 

        gives the students a sense of place. One map is that of South Africa building 

        national understanding, a second is a more regional map to encourage networking 

        and local connectivity. In addition maps of collaborating countries may 

        be included.</p>

      <p>The chosen map is rolled out onto the floor of the community centre or 

        school. On a variety of sites at which stories have been collected a set 

        of pedestals are placed. These pedestals include PDA&#146;s through which 

        the children can receive and send their stories. The PDA&#146;s are sturdy 

        and battery-operated and include an integrated cell phone so that there 

        are no moveable parts that can be damaged. The PDA&#146;s are collapsible 

        and stackable so as not to take up too much room in the van itself. The 

        children can walk through the map and the pedestals. They can press the 

        screens and view a selection of taped stories created by other children 

        or elders. They can interact with the stories with a limited number of 

        optional branches. These stories are ideally subtitled (or dubbed if necessary) 

        in the primary language that is used at the school. </p>

      <p>In South Africa today English is compulsory while Afrikaans has become 

        optional for students with a non-Afrikaans background. Local languages 

        are varied with six primary languages in use throughout the country. English 

        then becomes a possible common language for broader communication while 

        it is important to include and encourage at least a version of the stories 

        in local languages to build up local networking and reinforce local identity.</p>

      <p>The children may also send SMS messages, through an SMS portal, to the 

        narrators with comments about the stories and shared similar experiences. 

        This active participation of the children is necessary to ensure that 

        they understand the processes of the communication that are happening. 

        Finally the children upload their stories into the pedestals through a 

        simple visual guide. Thus the child is participating in creating the exhibition 

        itself, thereby developing an understanding of how the exhibition is built 

        and how new technology can be utilised for communication purposes.</p>

      <p>Addressing the issue of continuity, the project involves leaving one 

        cell-phone per school/community group for SMS-messaging contact as well 

        as copies of at least some of the videoed stories for schools which would 

        be able to view this material (i.e. that have electricity, a VHS player 

        and a TV monitor). One obvious advantage of the cell-phone is that electricity 

        is not necessarily a requirement.</p>

      <h2>WWW</h2>

      <p>A further feature of the project involves the use of a website which 

        those schools with access to computers and the net can continue to access. 

        This requires a stable satellite up-link present in large parts of South 

        Africa. Mobile coverage is also good along most highways and in urban 

        and semi-urban centres. Where satellite coverage is not sufficient, drop-points 

        may be used to up- and download the stories. This leads to a greater time 

        delay in feedback.</p>

      <p>The website involves an intuitive interface and a simple basic structure 

        and is therefore easy to use both by children under guidance as well as 

        the general public. Through the website children and students can access 

        from the home page a web-version of the map exhibition in which they can 

        change languages. They may select different countries on the world map, 

        they can choose particular objects which have inspired stories, and they 

        can continue to send SMS and emailed messages to other children through 

        the SMS portal. In addition, through the web, they can pick up a webcam 

        exhibition showing where the van is and receive updates on the journey 

        of the van and the issues that are predominant in that particular region. 

        As such this is similar other webbed journey stories carried out in other 

        regions of the world. </p>

      <p>The secondary function of the website is to provide an easy to use interface 

        for maintaining and updating the content of the web site. The web Back 

        Office fulfils this function. It enables people with basic computer training 

        to upload the stories that have been recorded to the Internet. They do 

        this by typing in necessary information about the digital recording and 

        adding links to the recording. Afterwards all the information is automatically 

        uploaded and stored. It will then instantly become a part of the Map Exhibition 

        and the Webcam Map. The Back Office is also used to upload translations 

        and subtitles to the stories. </p>

      <p>The stories are complemented, through the Back Office, with information 

        on regional differences through which the van travels - questions such 

        as population density, environmental issues, history etc. which may be 

        of use for teachers. As the database grows it will contain a large amount 

        of material relevant to understanding the storyteller&#146;s daily life. 

        The Back Office ensures also that the search function which offers criteria 

        such as themes, location, languages and age of storyteller, functions 

        so that it may be of use both for museum staff but also for researchers 

        and teachers who which to use the portal in teaching social studies. Finally, 

        the Back Office provides an element of training of local staff.</p>

      <h1>Summary</h1>

      <p>The Iziko Stories project addresses many of the issues raised in this 

        paper. It is concerned with networking within regions rather than only 

        working on a centre-periphery axis. It is concerned with active participation 

        of children and local communities. It works towards deepening cultural 

        heritage not in a manner that essentialises local communities but one 

        that allows for expression of interrelatedness. It addresses the issue 

        of learning through access and utilisation of new technologies but also 

        giving the children a sense of space and geography. Through stories it 

        assures universal interest as well as expression of local perspectives, 

        local desires and local needs. </p>

      <p>Obviously it is not sufficient on its own to redress the unbalanced representations 

        that have developed within South African museums during the colonial and 

        apartheid periods. For this to happen a fundamental transformation of 

        curatorial practices needs to take place. Other voices, other stories 

        need to move into the established museum spaces as well as the virtual 

        spaces. The Iziko Stories project does, however, offer a start that allows 

        people with diverging backgrounds to participate in both the transformation 

        of museums as well as transformations in communication practices through 

        new technologies.</p>

      <p>The project is still seeking both collaborative overseas partners and 

        further sponsors.</p>
