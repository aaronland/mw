      <p class=PaperTitle>Integrating a Traveling Exhibit, Catalog and Educational 

        Web Site</p>

        Interactive Knowledge, Inc., USA</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The National Endowment for the Humanities along with 

        NEA and the Rockefeller Foundation awarded funding to the Mint Museum 

        of Art in Charlotte, North Carolina, to develop an integrated project 

        that could become the definitive work related to one of the most pervasive 

        but little understood aspects of pre-Columbian cultures - the ballgame. 

        The idea was to organize a traveling exhibition that was supplemented 

        not only by a catalogue, but also by a large scale and comprehensive educational 

        Web site. This approach produced an outcome that is more than the sum 

        of the three individual parts. The traveling exhibition is the result 

        of years of international negotiations and research. It represents the 

        first time that many of the most valued artifacts related to the ballgame 

        have appeared in one place. The catalogue includes eleven articles written 

        by leading scholars in this field and over 150 pages of color photographs. 

        It is the most definitive work to date on the history of the ballgame 

        and its relevance to modern society. The educational Web site is a comprehensive 

        treatment of the subject that is accessible to school children and scholars 

        alike. It presents an educational context for understanding the exhibition 

        and catalogue that greatly enhances both the museum and catalogue experience.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>Museum exhibitions are a unique way of presenting scholarly material 

        to a general audience. An exhibition permits teams of academic and technical 

        specialists the opportunity to present new findings and test innovative 

        methods for presenting and interpreting the material. Thus, by the time 

        the exhibition is finally viewed by visitors, a rather lengthy and complex 

        process has culminated. Major exhibitions in their current manifestations 

        are collaborative and multi-disciplinary, exploring a variety of interpretative 

        strategies from wall and case text, audio guides, catalogues, and the 

        increasingly rare human guide. Multimedia technology has opened exciting 

        new vistas in interpretation because it offers the possibility for creating 

        a very engaging and interactive context for learning about the art and 

        culture being explored in the exhibition. </p>

      <p>In 1998, the Mint Museum of Art began planning a major exhibition of 

        ancient Mesoamerican art, titled, <i>The Sport of Life and Death: The 

        Mesoamerican Ballgame</i>. The unifying theme of this exhibition was a 

        ritual game played throughout Mesoamerica&#151;the modern region of Mexico, 

        Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras, from around 1800 B.C. until the Spanish 

        Conquest in the early 1500s. The &#147;ballgame,&#148; as this ceremonial 

        sport is commonly known, was played with a rubber ball in specially constructed 

        masonry courts&#151;much like modern sports arenas. The game was played 

        between teams; indeed, as the exhibit touts, it was the first team sport 

        in human history. It was, however, more than mere sport; the ballgame 

        was layered with mythic symbolism and ritual pageantry. The ballgame inspired 

        the creation of thousands of works of art, and these surviving narratives 

        form the basis of our interpretation of this ancient phenomenon. Moreover, 

        modern versions of the ancient games are still played in various regions 

        of Mexico, studies of which have aided scholars in their interpretation 

        of the ritual sports played thousands of years earlier.</p>

      <p>From the onset, an integrated project approach was the model developed 

        for the various components of <i>The Sport of Life and Death: The Mesoamerican 

        Ballgame</i>. The exhibition itself would form the project&#146;s foundation. 

        To the exhibition, thirty institutional lenders from the United States 

        and Mexico lent 180 works of pre-Columbian art. </p>

        Figure 1: Olmec figurine 1250-700 B.C. </p>

      <p>Once this object checklist was secure, production on the exhibition catalogue 

        began. The catalogue, with its eleven scholarly essays, became the research 

        base from which information was gleaned for didactic material in the galleries, 

        such as object labels and text panels, public programs, and the educational 

        Web site (Whittington 2001).</p>

      <h1>Timeline</h1>

      <p>The integration of the exhibition, catalogue, and educational Web site 

        was a by-product of a series of planning symposia organized by the exhibition 

        curator. The first of these, held in October 1998, brought together a 

        core group of pre-Columbian scholars. Three distinguished Mesoamerican 

        specialists: John F. Scott (University of Florida), Jane Stevenson Day 

        (Denver Museum of Nature and Science), and Gillett Griffin (Princeton 

        Art Museum), formed this initial group, together with the exhibition curator, 

        E. Michael Whittington. This team created the themes around which the 

        exhibition would be developed, identified major collections from which 

        to secure loans, suggested essay topics for the catalogue, and discussed 

        the applications for which interactive technology would be ideally suited. 

        Their findings were incorporated into a planning grant proposal submitted 

        to the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in February, 1999. 

        The NEH awarded the Mint Museum of Art a $40,000.00 planning grant in 

        September, 1999. </p>

      <p>The planning proposal narrative expressed a desire to use interactive 

        technologies not only to teach the fundamental aspects of the Mesoamerican 

        ballgame, but also to share essential information on the culture, history, 

        and art of ancient American civilizations. The project consultants - now 

        broadened to a team of interdisciplinary humanities scholars and technology 

        professionals - commented that the interactive format of a Web site was 

        the ideal medium to present this type of information, since it would permit 

        users educational opportunities not available in traditional exhibition 

        formats. Among the ideas presented in the planning proposal discussion 

        were a virtual tour of a Mesoamerica ballcourt and an interactive ballgame 

        in which users dressed their teams in elaborate ceremonial equipment - 

        similar to the objects on display in the exhibition. Notably, both of 

        these concepts were carried to full fruition in the final product. </p>

      <p>The planning proposal documented the contributions of the Mint Museum 

        of Art in this emerging field. For example, the Museum has an impressive 

        history with such technologies for object interpretation. For school-age 

        audiences, fifth graders access objects from the pre-Columbian collection 

        and answer riddles, find clues, and discover facts from special software 

        installed in their schools with the Mint&#146;s <i>D.I.G.S.</i> program. 

        A complimentary programs &#147;<i>D.I.G.S. II</i>&#148; entitled <i>Crafting 

        North Carolina </i>is used for fourth graders studying state history. 

        It uses objects from the Mint&#146;s North Carolina pottery collection, 

        and includes history games and puzzles to aid learning. A partnership 

        made possible by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services 

        permitted the Mint Museum of Art and the Public Library of Charlotte &amp; 

        Mecklenburg County to create a Web site for families based on the craft 

        collection. Entitled <i>Weaving a Tale</i> <i>of Craft,</i> it featured 

        interactive activities designed to introduce important concepts and traditions 

        related to pottery, basketry and weaving. </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="whittingtonfig2.jpg" width="400" height="299"><br>

        Figure 2: The Home Page for Weaving a Tale of Craft</p>

      <p>Early Mint projects utilizing interactive technology included two CD-ROM 

        catalogues for exhibitions highlighting parts of the permanent collection: 

        ancient and Spanish Colonial Andean art, and North Carolina pottery. For 

        the Mint-organized, nationally-traveling exhibition <i>Michael Lucero 

        Sculpture 1976-1995</i>, a Web site was created offering glimpses of the 

        artist&#146;s extraordinary and colorful ceramic sculpture. An interactive 

        children&#146;s page allowed site visitors to construct their own sculpture 

        in the manner of the artist.</p>

      <p>The NEH-funded planning process generated several significant results: 

        (1) travel to museums in the US, Mexico, and Europe to identify collections 

        and negotiate loans; (2) expansion of the advisory team of humanities 

        scholars to include prospective catalogue essayists and technology professionals; 

        and (3) preparation of Implementation grant proposals submitted to the 

        National Endowment for the Humanities, National Endowment for the Arts, 

        and the Rockefeller Foundation. The expanded advisory team included the 

        original members with the additions of Eric Taladoire (University of Paris, 

        France); Laura Filloy Nadal (Museo Nacional de Antropología, Mexico); 

        Ted Leyenaar (Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, Netherlands); Douglas Bradley 

        (Snite Museum, University of Notre Dame); Mary Miller (Yale University); 

        Eduardo Matos Moctezuma (Museo del Templo Mayor, Mexico); Maria Teresa 

        Uriarte (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México); and Michael Tarkanian 

        and Dorothy Hosler (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Tim Songer 

        and Chuck Barger of Interactive Knowledge, Inc., were selected as the 

        technology advisors and developers of the educational Web site. </p>

      <p>In November 1999, a second planning symposium was held at the Mint Museum 

        of Art and facilitated by the exhibition curator. Attending were Mint 

        staff, the scholarly advisory team and the staff of Interactive Knowledge. 

        This meeting marked the culmination of the NEH-funded planning period, 

        and the agenda was designed to refine the scope of the exhibition, discuss 

        proposed catalogue essays, and facilitate the exchange of ideas between 

        the technology professionals and Mesoamerican scholars.</p>

      <p>While some of the project&#146;s humanities scholars were technologically 

        savvy, others were traditional academics accustomed to presenting information 

        within the confines of discipline-based conferences and journals. Thus 

        were the goals of the <i>Sport of Life and Death: The Mesoamerican Ballgame</i> 

        project crystallized&#151;the selection of an exhibition topic of profound 

        scholarly merit, yet with broad popular appeal which could be disseminated 

        to a world-wide audience through the use of traditional media and emerging 

        technologies. The project&#146;s interpretive strategy&#151;heretofore 

        constantly evolving&#151;was further refined to create an integrated approach 

        for all three components of the project, the catalogue, the exhibition 

        and the educational Web site:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Catalogue - The print catalogue, 

          with its definitive essays and individual object entries, including 

          hundreds of full color photographs&#151;would serve as the benchmark 

          for all interpretive components of the project. <br>

          <br>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Exhibition &#150; The traveling 

          exhibition, the first time many of these extremely important artifacts 

          of the Mesoamerican world have ever been displayed together&#151;would 

          offer visitors a powerful visual and spatial experience&#151;the only 

          opportunity to truly comprehend the size, weight and texture of the 

          featured art.<br>

          <br>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Educational Web site - The Web 

          site, featuring a wide variety of interactive, multimedia activities 

          using photographs, animation, QTVR, audio and video &#150; would create 

          an engaging context for understanding the ballgame and the ancient cultures 

          that invented and continued this ritual event for over three thousand 

          years.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>Planning and Production</h1>

      <p>The Web site team immediately began planning the site using the projected 

        information in the catalogue skillfully adapted to the middle school target 

        age for the site. In concert with the exhibition curator, Interactive 

        Knowledge, Inc., developed a prototype of the Web site for submission 

        with each of these proposals. Sample pages of the prototype were submitted 

        in hard copy but, importantly, the proposals encouraged viewing the site 

        on-line.</p>

      <p>This access permitted the grant reviewers to understand the significance 

        of multimedia technology as an interpretive tool for ancient Mesoamerican 

        art and culture. The prototype stressed the following factors: the middle 

        school target audience; the integration of the exhibition components, 

        Web site and classroom activities; and interactive technology&#146;s capacity 

        for teaching ancient art by including virtual tours of archaeological 

        sites, classroom and other activities. As with the first planning symposium, 

        the efforts of the teams of advisors, museum staff, and technology professionals 

        were incorporated into implementation grant proposals submitted to the 

        National Endowment for the Humanities, National Endowment for the Art, 

        and the Rockefeller Foundation. All three proposals were funded, resulting 

        in $300,000.00 (NEH), $95,000.00 (NEA), and $75,000.00 (Rockefeller) in 

        support to create the exhibition catalogue, and Web site, and pay installation 

        and transportation costs. </p>

      <p>Production of <i>The Sport of Life and Death: The Mesoamerican Ballgame 

        </i>project&#146;s multiple components followed a strict timetable. The 

        exhibition was scheduled to open to the general public at 22 September 

        2001. The first phase to go into production was the print catalogue, submitted 

        to the publisher, Thames &amp; Hudson, in January 2001 (Whittington 2001). 

        Produced in both soft- and hard-cover editions, the catalogue is 288 pages, 

        with 160 color illustrations. Shortly after the catalogue went into production, 

        Web site production meetings between the exhibition curator and the staff 

        of Interactive Knowledge began in earnest. These first series of meetings 

        re-established the goals and objectives of the educational Web site and 

        created flowcharts establishing specific duties and production deadlines. 

        Design and production() began in January, 2001 and was completed in August, 

        2001.</p>

        Figure 4: Home page for The Sport of Life and Death: The Mesoamerican 

        Ballgame</p>

      <p>The Web site design team at Interactive Knowledge, consisting of two 

        instructional designers, an art director and two Flash programmers, worked 

        with the exhibit curator to develop goals for the site. The most important 

        was to create an engaging context for a wide audience to understand the 

        culture and art of the Mesoamerican world. Though the focus for most activities 

        was to reach a 5<sup>th</sup> -7<sup>th</sup> grade student population, 

        the design needed to be appropriate for adults as well. Another significant 

        goal was to present the action of the ballgame in such a way that visitors 

        to the site could feel they had experienced the game. The use of interactivity 

        and multimedia, features available through the Internet but not within 

        the catalogue or at the exhibition, became a critical component for presenting 

        a virtual ballgame experience. After considering a number of ways to try 

        to capture the experience of the game, the Web team ultimately devised 

        three unique approaches:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Video re-enactment - In the mid-1990s, 

          National Geographic Society produced a documentary on the Mayan civilization 

          titled, &quot;Lost Kingdoms of the Maya.&#148; A re-enactment of the 

          ballgame was staged using modern day players of a contemporary version 

          of the game. The footage was deemed appropriate for use in this site 

          because the players were dressed in 15<sup>th</sup> century costumes 

          and the game was being played in the famous ballcourt at Copan - a restored 

          archeological site in Honduras. National Geographic Society received 

          credit for the footage and a fee for the rights to use it in on the 

          site. The video clip provides a genuine experience through close-ups 

          of the players faces, the ball and wide angle shots of the impressive 

          location and ballcourt structure. <br>

          <br>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Viewing the Game - One of the 

          rarest and most valuable works of art featured in the exhibit is a clay 

          model of a ballcourt complete with players, referees and spectators. 

          Part of the Yale University Art Gallery's collection, it was created 

          by an artist living in Western Mexico sometime between 200 BC and 250 

          AD. The Web site team planned to feature this work from the earliest 

          discussions of the project. A number of ideas were considered, but one 

          of the problems in finalizing any plans was the lack of access to the 

          art until only a few weeks before the site was to be completed. After 

          contacting Yale to discuss the possibility of arranging an earlier shipment 

          of the model to Charlotte, the team learned that the Yale Art Gallery 

          was undertaking a large scale documentation project that included producing 

          high resolution QTVR files of many important works of art. The ballcourt 

          model was scheduled to be part of this process. After a few discussions 

          with the Yale University Art Gallery Digital Imaging Department, the 

          schedule for photographing the ballcourt model was moved up to accommodate 

          the Web design team's needs. The extremely high resolution photos and 

          QTVR files were used to create a virtual tour of the model that includes 

          an audio track featuring the exhibit's curator describing details of 

          the work. <br>

          <br>

          </span><span class="MsoCaption"><img src="whittingtonfigure5.jpg" width="380" height="571" class="MsoCaption"> <br>

          Figure 5: Close up photograph from the Yale ballcourt model</span><span class="normal"><br>

          <br>

          The model is presented in a series of rotating images and extreme close 

          ups. The audio track, with narration and music, creates an intimate 

          experience that could only be replicated if one were standing in front 

          of the actual ballcourt model, discussing it with the curator himself.<br>

          <br>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Playing the Game - The Mint Museum staff as well 

          as the Web design team were committed from the outset of this project 

          to providing visitors to the site with an opportunity to play the game. 

          How to create that experience became a source of much discussion. The 

          budget did not allow for the development of a 3-D version of the game 

          complete with Sega-style competition and gory ritual sacrifice of the 

          losers. Something as simple as a &quot;Pong&quot; type game was too 

          childish and would not suit the subject matter of the exhibit. After 

          much experimentation, an animated quiz was designed in Flash that provides 

          action, interactivity, sound effects and consequences for correct and 

          incorrect answers. The quiz quickly became one of the most popular features 

          of the site. It includes a bank of thirty questions about the ballgame 

          (all of the answers can be found in the site) that are randomly generated 

          during each new game. Two animated teams are represented on an illustrated 

          ballcourt. The Web site visitor answers questions for the home team 

          and watches the ball bounce between players before and after every response. 

          The correct answer causes the visiting team to miss-hit the ball and 

          gives the home team a point. Incorrect answers have the opposite effect. 

          The first team to accrue five points is honored with music and flowers.</span></li>

      <h1>Purposes</h1>

      <h2>The Catalogue</h2>

      <p>As stated previously, the three main components of <i>The Sport of Life 

        and Death: The Mesoamerican Ballgame </i>project (catalogue, exhibit, 

        Web site) were intended to be distinct, yet complimentary. The catalogue 

        was conceived as the permanent record of the exhibition, its goal to be 

        a definitive source of scholarly information on the topic. As such, its 

        target audiences were specialists in the field, non-specialists interested 

        in ancient Mesoamerican art, and adult museum visitors. Great care was 

        taken by the exhibition curator, who also served as volume editor, to 

        have this publication make a significant scholarly contribution, yet still 

        be accessible to a general audience&#151;factors are not necessarily in 

        competition. Importantly, the catalogue&#146;s contributors fully supported 

        these goals. Essays were edited to ensure reading consistency and to eliminate 

        academic jargon, while at the same time attempting to preserve the author&#146;s 

        voice. Principal among the goals of this project was a large and diverse 

        audience. Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd (London/New York) was selected as the 

        publisher of <i>The Sport of Life and Death: The Mesoamerican Ballgame</i> 

        because of its world-wide distribution network, in addition to its prestigious 

        reputation as one of the foremost publishers of art and archaeology books. 

      </p>

      <h2>Exhibition</h2>

      <p>The topic of the Mesoamerican ballgame has provoked serious inquiry for 

        generations. Yet the majority of these finding have been confined to academic 

        journals, scholarly symposia, and publications of rather limited distribution. 

        At the same time, general knowledge of ancient Mesoamerican culture and 

        art has risen as a result of popular magazines, such as <i>National Geographic</i> 

        and <i>Archaeology</i>, and an increasing number of widely broadcast documentaries. 

        While several exhibitions had included the ballgame as a theme, no singular 

        traveling exhibition on this topic had ever been organized in the United 

        States (Schele and Miller 1986; Leyenaar 1988). The exhibition format 

        was particularly well-suited to the topic of the ancient Mesoamerican 

        games since thousands of works of art depicting the games, the players 

        and architectural elements from ballcourts exist in museum collections 

        throughout the United States, Mexico, and Europe. It is this primacy of 

        experience - in which the visitor comes face-to-face with the tangible, 

        creative efforts of humanity - that is at the heart of the museum experience 

        and that the exhibition curator sought to convey.</p>

      <h2>Educational Web site</h2>

      <p>The nature and complexity of the themes and contents explored in <b><i>The 

        Sport of Life and Death</i></b> made it a unique opportunity to use interactive 

        technologies. It was the exhibition curator&#146;s desire to teach the 

        fundamental aspects of the Mesoamerican ballgame, as well as share essential 

        information on the culture, history, and art of ancient American civilizations. 

        The interactive format of a Web site made it the ideal medium to present 

        this information, as it permitted users educational opportunities not 

        available in traditional exhibition formats. There were two goals that 

        the design of <b><i>The Sport of Life and Death</i></b> Web site sought 

        to address. First, the art objects included in the exhibition should be 

        placed in a meaningful context to give Web site visitors an experience 

        that is different than a museum visit, but still rewarding. Second, the 

        Web site should introduce the pre-Columbian cultures that gave rise to 

        the art objects featured in the exhibition, provide an understanding of 

        the geography and natural history of the region, as well as present aspects 

        of the exhibition itself. While it was recognized that virtual visits 

        on the Web would be quite different from a trip to the art museum, a well 

        designed Web site would create an effective and memorable experience and 

        appeal to those who might not choose to or be able to visit a museum.</p>

      <p>The Web site was intended to allow the public to prepare for a visit 

        and to enrich understanding afterward, and it was seen as a powerful tool 

        for communicating the exhibition&#146;s themes to those unable to visit 

        the museum (schools, homes and libraries). The Mint Museum of Art also 

        provided access to the Web site via terminals stationed in the Educational 

        Resource Center at the beginning of the exhibition (each of the venues 

        on the exhibition tour have been encouraged to do the same). <b><i>The 

        Sport of Life and Death</i></b> site was also to integrate well with the 

        Mint&#146;s Web site to enable users to learn of related programming and 

        explore the museum&#146;s other collections. The exhibition curator and 

        Web designers felt strongly that animation, audio and video should be 

        used throughout to heighten the encounter with works of art and archaeological 

        sites. </p>

      <p>The Web site structure is divided into four sections:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Explore the Mesoamerican World 

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Explore the Mesoamerican Ballgame 

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Experience the Ballgame </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Experience the Exhibit </span></li>

      </ul>

      <h3>1.Explore the Mesoamerican World </h3>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="whittingtonfigure7.jpg" width="380" height="214"><br>

        Figure 7: Opening screen for the Explore the Mesoamerican World section</p>

      <p>This section provides a compelling introduction to Mesoamerica and the 

        ancient cultures that thrived there. Here, visitors can view a series 

        of interactive maps and timelines designed to create a geographical and 

        historical context. The maps include ancient and modern geo-political 

        information and background. Visitors to the site see an overview of areas 

        where the ballgame was played and a representative sample of the different 

        types of art that were produced in various Mesoamerican regions. The most 

        compelling reason for developing this timeline was to visually demonstrate 

        the incredible duration of the ballgame across four millennia.</p>

      <h3>2.Explore the Mesoamerican Ballgame</h3>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="whittingtonfigure8.jpg" width="380" height="210"><br>

        Figure 8: Opening screen for the Explore the Mesoamerican Ballgame section 

      </p>

      <p>Section 2 includes distinct subsections: The Ball, The Uniform, The Court, 

        The Ballgame. Visitors to the site learn about the ball, how rubber used 

        to make the ball was processed, and the reaction of Spanish conquistadors 

        when they saw a rubber ball for the first time. The ballplayers&#146; 

        uniforms, with both the ritual and the practical adornments, are explored 

        in depth. An interactive activity allows visitors to dress players, choosing 

        from a variety of options, and print their results. <b><i>The Sport of 

        Life and Death</i> </b>site also includes a virtual tour of the Mesoamerican 

        ballcourt at Copán, Honduras, presented in seamless, 360-degree format 

        (QTVR). This section also examines the ballgame from a variety of perspectives, 

        including a description of the rules and their variations across the years 

        as well as a description by Spanish invaders of a game played several 

        hundred years ago. The art created to document and celebrate the ballgame 

        is explored via several series of pop-up windows that label and describe 

        the artifacts in great detail.</p>

      <h3>3. Experience the Ballgame </h3>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="whittingtonfigure9.jpg" width="380" height="213"><br>

        Figure 9: Opening screen to the Experience the Ballgame section</p>

      <p>Section 3 includes two interactive methods, called View the Game and 

        Play the Game, for experiencing the game described earlier in this paper. 

        Visitors to the site can View the Game by choosing to hear the exhibit 

        curator describe the significance of an ancient ballcourt model while 

        high resolution images of the object appear and rotate on the screen. 

        A low bandwidth version of this experience is also available. Play the 

        Game is an interactive, animated quiz that allows visitors to the site 

        an opportunity to prove their knowledge of the ballgame by answering a 

        series of questions. Correct or incorrect responses cause the illustrated 

        players in the field to hit or miss the next volley of the rubber ball. 

        Both of these features have proven to be extremely popular and effective 

        with visitors to the site.</p>

      <h3>4.Experience the Exhibit</h3>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="whittingtonfigure10.jpg" width="380" height="213"><br>

        Figure 10: Opening screen to the Experience the Exhibit section </p>

      <p>Section 4features an in-depth look at the schedule and special events 

        at each of the venues that will host the exhibition. This section was 

        created as a database that each of the four museums included in the tour 

        has access to. Special, easy-to-use input screens were developed for each 

        of the museums to use in typing their schedules, press releases and special 

        event information. Each of the museums was encouraged to create a link 

        from its web site to the ballgame site. </p>

      <p>The Mint Museum of Art recognized the importance of registering the domain 

        <a

href="../http://www.ballgame.org/" target="_blank">http://www.ballgame.org</a>.This 

        URL was prominently disseminated in all advertising media. The Web team 

        from Interactive Knowledge launched the splash page of the site several 

        months prior to the exhibition opening. This page had the appearance of 

        a movie trailer, complete with &#147;Coming in September&#148; banners 

        (Figure 10). Thus, the site was conceived as a marketing tool for the 

        exhibition itself.</p>

      <h1>Power of an Integrated Approach</h1>

      <p>As <i>The Sport of Life and Death: The Mesoamerican Ballgame</i> exhibition 

        travels around the country throughout 2002, host museums and their patrons 

        will greatly benefit from the integrated approach taken in producing this 

        project. The catalogue includes some of the most current and scholarly 

        writing on the ballgame culture. The book includes stunning photography 

        of hundreds of works of art and is published by Thames &amp; Hudson, one 

        of the world's most highly regarded publishers in the field or art and 

        archeology. Visiting the exhibit offers a rich and dramatic experience. 

        The art of the ballgame provides a glimpse of over three thousand years 

        of ancient cultures and includes art ranging in size from monumental to 

        miniature. The texture and shapes of the various palmas, yokes, hachas 

        and reliefs offer an intriguing storyline about the importance of this 

        ritual game in the lives of countless generations of Mesoamericans. As 

        with most major traveling exhibitions, thousands of ardent patrons will 

        visit the exhibit &#150; perhaps more than once - purchase the catalogue, 

        and expand their understanding of this topic by reading the essays and 

        reviewing the photographs of the art. But those who are fortunate enough 

        to be able to experience the exhibit in person and bring home a catalogue 

        represent only a small fraction of the potential audience for this project. 

        By including a large scale, well designed educational Web site, the reach 

        of this project is increased exponentially.</p>

      <p>From the opening of the exhibition in Charlotte, North Carolina, in September, 

        2001 through the end of January, 2002, nearly 1.5 million hits were recorded 

        at the Web site. The Mint Museum of Art as well as all the museums featuring 

        this exhibit heavily promoted the Web site with all their marketing and 

        promotional materials. The schools that were able to schedule field trips 

        for their students benefited greatly from the engaging online activities 

        &#150; suitable for most grades-- as well as from the creative lesson 

        plans available on the site. The lesson plans are also designed for use 

        in a variety of classrooms and do not require Internet access to complete. 

        By offering an engaging context for learning about the ballgame and the 

        cultures who played it, the Web site prepared anyone who visited the site 

        before seeing the exhibition with a wealth of background knowledge and 

        a sense of the significance of this art. The Web site provides a great 

        resource for those who see the exhibit, but it also creates a tremendous 

        opportunity for the project to reach hundreds of thousands of other interested 

        children and adults who will never see the exhibit or the catalogue.</p>

      <p>The ballgame Web site, like the exhibit, has enjoyed a great deal of 

        national attention. To date, the site has been recognized with awards 

        and citations from major Internet players including Yahoo!, Macromedia, 

        Exploratorium and Omni, and it has been entered in a number of design 

        competitions. In addition, the site has received positive reviews in several 

        national newspapers and periodicals, including the Washington Times, Christian 

        Science Monitor and Archeology Today. This publicity, combined with careful 

        attention to maximizing the site's profile on the major search engines 

        and critical listservs, has produced a steady stream of visitors to the 

        ballgame Web site. While visits to the site fell off in the months after 

        the opening of the exhibition in Charlotte, the number of hits has increased 

        almost to their highest levels again now that the exhibition is opening 

        in New Orleans. The potential for maintaining a steady stream of visitors 

        to the site is very high as the exhibit travels around the country in 

        2002.</p>

      <p>The goals for educating and entertaining broad audiences with <i>The 

        Sport of Life and Death: The Mesoamerican Ballgame </i>catalogue, exhibition 

        and Web site are being achieved. The lessons learned from integrating 

        the efforts of the Exhibition Curator, the advisory group of Mesoamerican 

        scholars, and the educational Web site design team will be applied to 

        all future projects undertaken by the Mint Museum of Art and Interactive 

        Knowledge.</p>
