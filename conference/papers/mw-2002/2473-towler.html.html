The website currently consists of a single English language site sitting on an NT server at WebCentral, an Australian ISP. The Duyfken Foundation wants to translate the entire site into Dutch.

      <p class=PaperTitle>Here and There: Managing Multiply-Purposed Digital Assets 

        on the Duyfken Web site</p>

      <p class=Author>Marjolein Towler, CONSULTAS Pty Ltd., Valerie Hobbs and 

        Diarmuid Pigott<sup>,  </sup>Murdoch University, Australia</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>In this paper we describe a model for managing a dynamic 

        Web site with multiple concurrent versions. The voyage of the Duyfken 

        replica from Australia to the Netherlands has generated great interest 

        in its associated Web  site, and it is now planned to extend the original 

        site to mirror sites in both Australia and the Netherlands, each completely 

        bilingual, resulting in four different &#145;virtual&#146; Web sites. 

        However, the &#145;look and feel&#146; of the Web site needs to be the 

        same across all the virtual sites, and the media resource used will be 

        the same. We propose a solution based on multiple sets of concurrent metadata, 

        and discuss some general implications of this approach for metadata harvesting 

        and resource discovery. We describe our prototype, which is based on a 

        database that handles parallel sets of metadata, together with the process 

        for accession and annotation of media artefacts, and the dynamic generation 

        of the Web pages from the database. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>The Duyfken Web site is the on-line exhibition of the Duyfken Replica. 

        It serves to tell the story of the conception, construction and embarkation 

        of the replica, and thereafter to recount its voyages around the world, 

        much as the broadsheets informed the citizens of Haarlem and Amsterdam 

        of the progress of the original voyage in the 17<sup>th</sup> Century. 

        The Web site is the only exhibition available when the ship is between 

        ports, and is currently charting the progress of the VOC2002 Voyagie. 

        It is now planned to extend the original site to mirror sites in both 

        Australia and the Netherlands, each completely bilingual, resulting in 

        four different &#145;virtual&#146; Web sites.</p>

      <p>In this paper we describe the remodeling of the Duyfken Web site to accommodate 

        multiple concurrent versions, of different languages and locations, dynamically 

        delivered to the Web pages from a database and a media repository. The 

        case of the Duyfken Web site provides us with a rare instance where we 

        can examine the theoretical issues involved in multiple concurrency of 

        semantic roles of media artefacts within the context of a practical example 

        with real life pressures and constraints. </p>

      <p>We first present a description of the Duyfken Replica project and the 

        parallel development of the Web site. This demonstrates what the situation 

        we are now facing is and how it came to be that way. We then describe 

        the proposed remodelling of the site database and the revised procedures 

        required to create it, drawing on the analysis of patterns in semantic 

        usage and repurposing of media artefacts, and on the ways metadata is 

        used to focus a resource to a goal-driven functionality.</p>

      <h2>The 1606 Duyfken Replica</h2>

      <p>In 1606 <i>Duyfken</i>, owned by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and 

        stationed in the East Indies, made a voyage of exploration looking for 

        &#145;east and south lands&#146; which took it on the first historically 

        recorded voyage to Australia. As part of bringing Australian history to 

        life, the <i>Duyfken</i> replica was built at the Lotteries <i>Duyfken</i> 

        Village Shipyard in front of the Maritime Museum in Fremantle, Western 

        Australia. Duyfken was built &#145;plank first&#146;, a method developed 

        by Dutch shipwrights of the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> Centuries. 

        No original plans of any ship from the Age of Discovery exist because 

        shipwrights did not use plans drawn on paper or parchment. The only plans 

        were in the master-shipwright's head, and the ships themselves were built 

        by eye. Although replicas or reconstructions of several Age of Discovery 

        ships have been built in recent times, few of them seem to be able to 

        sail anything like as well as the original ships, proving how little we 

        understand of how these ships were built originally. </p>

      <p>One of the stated objectives of the <i>Duyfken</i> Replica Project has 

        been to produce a reconstruction that sails well enough to emulate the 

        achievements of the original <i>Duyfken </i>(see <a

href="../http://www.duyfken.com/replica/experimental.html" target="_blank">http://www.duyfken.com/replica/experimental.html</a>). 

        So since she was launched, the finished Duyfken replica undertook the 

        re-enactment expedition from Banda, Indonesia, to the Pennefather River 

        in North Queensland, Australia, in 2000 (<a href="../http://www.duyfken.com/expedition/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.duyfken.com/expedition/index.html</a>).  

        She is indeed one of the few square rig replicas of that era capable of 

        making an extended voyage under sail and, according to the known records, 

        lives up to the performance of the original ship.  She is currently sailing 

        the original Spice Route in the wake of her 17<sup>th</sup> Century predecessor 

        on her way to The Netherlands for the 2002 400 year VOC Celebrations (<a href="../http://www.duyfken.com/voyagie/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.duyfken.com/voyagie/index.html</a>). 

      </p>

      <h2>Duyfken Web site - original</h2>

      <p>The Web site <a

href="../http://www.duyfken.com/" target="_blank">www.duyfken.com</a>, built by Marjolein 

        Towler and her team from Consultas Pty Ltd, is the on-line exhibition 

        of the Duyfken Replica. It was initially developed to set the record straight. 

        Four Duyfken Web sites had sprung up over a period of 6 months after the 

        laying of the keel. None of these were under the control of the Replica 

        Foundation and in some cases were simply factually inaccurate. The Web 

        site was built to make correct information available about the original 

        ship and its historical significance. Collaboration between developer 

        (understanding technology and communication through digital media) and 

        content expert (understanding on a deep level what is relevant to the 

        topic)is crucial to any interactive media (Web) development, and Nick 

        Burningham, maritime historian and the principal researcher and designer 

        of the Duyfken replica, contributed his research and wrote all the original 

        content. </p>

      <p>The Web site also kept Web visitors informed of the building progress 

        of the replica. The shipyard was open to visitors, so the physical building 

        process was on exhibit; however, the Web site provided a central point 

        of access to a wider audience, albeit only those with on-line access. 

        The site was also used for Western Australian school curriculum activities, 

        and it built a solid audience of followers from around the world. </p>

      <p align="center"><a name="fig1"></a><a href="towlerfig1.html"><img src="towlersfig1.jpg" width="400" height="289" border="0"></a><br>

        <span class="MsoCaption">Figure 1 : Original Duyfken Web  site homepage 

        -1997<br>

        (<a href="towlerfig1.html">detailed image</a>)<br>

        </span></p>

      <p>The initial Web design was of a simple static HTML page nature. The structure 

        took into account the kind of audiences we thought at the time would be 

        interested in the topic: tall ship aficionados, primary school children, 

        the Dutch and Dutch Australians, fellow maritime archaeologists, the Friends 

        of the Duyfken association, historians, people interested in (model) ship 

        building and ships in general, history, and wood working.  This was a 

        very broad audience to please, so although the information structure took 

        the ship as its focal point, we tried to incorporate enough interest for 

        any of the specific audience groups we identified. </p>

      <p>The original Web site had two major topics: <i>Original</i> <i>Duyfken 

        </i>and <i>Replica</i> <i>Duyfken</i>, which each expanded to a number 

        of relevant subtopics (see Appendix). In addition there were general topics 

        available such as Seafarers Links and a Sponsors page. Any visitor arriving 

        at the homepage was presented with an introductory paragraph and could 

        then traverse to either topic or all subtopics from every page.  </p>

      <p>To accommodate the different learning styles of users, we incorporated 

        iconographic as well as text links.  The screen layout was designed to 

        fit on a 640x480pixel screen display and we limited the colour use to 

        accommodate 256 colour displays. No moving images were added, since from 

        a technology perspective we needed to accommodate low-end receivers and 

        slow modem connections.  We even limited the use of frames, because older 

        Web browsers did not support them. The site was designed to look identical 

        on both major browsers of the day (1997): Netscape and Internet Explorer, 

        and we recommended version 3.0 or higher for both.</p>

      <p>The only additions that were made to the Web site content in that time 

        were the photographs of the replica building progress and after much agonizing 

        - because it required a plug-in - QuickTime VR panoramas of the same topic. 

        These were produced by Geoff Jagoe and Barb de la Hunty from Mastery Multimedia 

        who offered their expertise. Collectively we argued that being able to 

        see the ship through the panoramas did significantly add to the experience 

        of the Web visitor, enough to justify the wait for the plug-in download, 

        anyway.  For those users who did not want to go through with that, there 

        were enough static images readily available.</p>

      <p>Content changes and additions had to be made by the Web developers, because 

        it required HTML editing. This was limited to once a month.<b> </b></p>

      <h2>duyfken.com &#150; Chevron 2000 Re-enactment Expedition</h2>

      <p>After her launch, the ship took off on the Chevron 2000 Expedition. This 

        re-enactment journey took her from Fremantle, Western Australia, to Jakarta, 

        Indonesia. From there she traveled the original journey to the Pennefather 

        River in North Queensland via the Spice Islands (<a href="../http://www.duyfken.com/expedition/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.duyfken.com/expedition/index.html</a>).

      <p>This dramatically changed the requirement for the Web site, because the 

        ship cannot be a physical exhibit when between ports. It thus became clear 

        that the Web site is the <i>only</i> exhibit when the ship is at sea, 

        and the only means of communicating her whereabouts to an audience. The 

        kind of audiences interested in such a Web site expanded too. Adventure 

        seekers, armchair travelers, sailing aficionados were added to the list. 

        The site underwent a major overhaul in its layout and interface, partly 

        to accommodate the Expedition section and partly to signify change, so 

        regular visitors would realise that there was additional material. </p>

      <p>The primary focus became the Expedition; the original content remained 

        but became ancillary material. The navigation changed to reflect the different 

        choices available and the Expedition section of the site was designed 

        to look significantly different to indicate its separate status. However, 

        we did make the clear choice to maintain the overall Web site homepage, 

        and not make the Expedition homepage the main entry into the site. Our 

        arguments were that the site was still the Duyfken Foundation Web site, 

        not just the Expedition&#146;s, and that new visitors would not know of 

        the entire topic choice if all they were presented with was the Expedition 

        homepage. </p>

      <p>We also made a concession to technology developments: the screen size 

        grew to 800x600pixels and the colour settings to 16bit. After 3 years, 

        nearly an eternity in technology terms, we felt that we would not leave 

        too many users behind by doing this.</p>

      <p>The content needs changed dramatically too. The project director Graeme 

        Cocks wanted to explore the idea of incorporating the Captain&#146;s Log 

        on the Web site with the potential to update it daily.  This was the basis 

        on which the dynamic database model was brought in.  The captain of the 

        ship at the time, Peter Manthorpe, e-mailed his logs via satellite to 

        the land station, the Duyfken Foundation office in Fremantle. Anybody 

        at hand there could and would go simply on-line to a secure URL and upload 

        the logs into the database. Photo images of the journey were sent intermittently 

        either when a reliable phone connection could be made, or when exposed 

        film could be sent to Fremantle for development and scanning. Once digitized 

        the images were uploaded in the database using the same procedure. This 

        also happened to the QuickTime VR panoramas that Nick Burningham produced 

        during the Expedition. </p>

      <p>A bulletin board was added to the site to allow site visitors to leave 

        messages. This system was set up to be moderated, but that was never explained 

        well by the programmers, so it did not prove very successful. The project 

        director used it a number of times for uploading press releases.</p>

      <p>The database was built to receive the messages, but it was rather unyielding. 

        The more Log messages were loaded, the longer it took to upload. In the 

        end it was so slow the programmers of the system had to come in to change 

        the &#145;time out&#146; settings on the server. It was not user friendly 

        to ordinary modem use, let alone slow connections in faraway places. </p>

      <p>From a design perspective, there were limitations too. The database structure 

        required page templates to be developed. Additional sections were not 

        so easily incorporated, especially not if they required dynamic access, 

        which needed specialist programming. It also required an ISP that allowed 

        client software to be placed on their servers, and that limited the choice 

        of ISPs available. </p>

      <p>The advantage was that anybody could upload text and image material through 

        the administration console; it did not required any specialist knowledge 

        of HTML or FTP. This was very important for the Foundation, since as a 

        non-profit organization it was largely dependent on volunteers. </p>

      <p>All the dynamic content in the Expedition database was transported to 

        a static HTML format. This made that content more stable (although it 

        increased the size of the Web site to around 600 pages).  It also cleared 

        the way to set up the new Voyagie section with a database connected through 

        ASP, which can be edited dynamically through an HTML administration console 

        on a secure URL. </p>

      <p>The Voyagie section has five dynamic sections: Captain&#146;s Log, News 

        &amp; Events, Image Galleries, What&#146;s New and the Dutch version of 

        the Captain&#146;s Log (&#145;Scheepsjournaal&#146;). Again, as with the 

        Expedition section, the administrator can upload any data (text, images, 

        QuickTime VR panoramas) through this console to those sections, including 

        the daily logs the current captain, Glenn Williams, emails via satellite. 

      </p>

      <p>The database underwent a redesign from the original Expedition one. It 

        was set up to allow for smaller monthly sections to be made. This limits 

        the data entries to no more than 31 (the maximum days in a month), thus 

        limiting the &#145;slowdown&#146; effect too much data had on the upload 

        procedure. It also not only has a secure URL, but now also requires password 

        access to avoid any accidental or malicious access by unauthorized users.<br>

      <p>The interface of the dynamic data pages also changed due to feedback 

        from users. The Captain&#146;s Log pages of the Expedition were on a dark 

        background, which was very dramatic and aesthetically pleasing as well 

        as easy to read from the screen. However, most visitors wanted to print 

        the logs out for keeping, or reading on paper, and we accommodated that 

        by developing a light background for the Captain&#146;s Logs in the Voyagie 

        section. </p>

      <p>The VOC2002 Voyagie brought an even greater significance than was already 

        there to the Dutch connection, and there was an extensive debate about 

        making the site available in Dutch. At the moment the only Dutch part 

        on the site is the &#145;Scheepsjournaal&#146;, the Dutch translation 

        of the Captain&#146;s Log. The Duyfken is sailing to the Netherlands and 

        will be traveling to all old VOC ports when she is there. There are great 

        VOC celebrations planned in the Netherlands throughout the coming year 

        to commemorate the start of the VOC four hundred years ago. All this has 

        posed some problems around control over the database, protocols of access 

        to the database and the way the information is displayed to the individual 

        Web visitor.</p>

      <h2>The Current Site and its Challenges</h2>

      <p>The Web site now contains of a mixture of archival, relatively static 

        material retained from the original site, and the extremely dynamic Voyagie 

        section that charts the progress of the replica day-by-day, providing 

        an ongoing narrative of the expedition. Following the great interest generated 

        in the voyage, the Duyfken Foundation wants to translate the entire site 

        into Dutch, and in addition, for speed of access reasons, to create a 

        mirror site of the entire development in the Netherlands.</p>

      <p> The site currently consists of a single English language site sitting 

        on an NT server at Web Central, an Australian ISP. The proposed changes 

        effectively mean doubling the site and having both Dutch and English versions 

        sitting side-by-side at Web Central, and a mirror of the site (Dutch/English) 

        on an NT Server at an ISP in the Netherlands. The language issue dictates 

        that there would be more than one person with access and in more than 

        one location (Australia/Netherlands), and there could well be a need to 

        have slightly differing information, especially in &#145;News &amp; Events&#146; 

        once the Duyfken has arrived in the Netherlands. Thus, instead of a single 

        site, we are looking at having four different &#145;virtual&#146; sites, 

        each potentially with differing content: English language in Australia, 

        Dutch language in Australia, English language in the Netherlands, and 

        Dutch language in the Netherlands. </p>

      <p>All this has serious ramifications for the dynamic uploading of data 

        through the administration console. With the division of the single site 

        into four concurrent virtual sites, there is the potential for problems 

        with control of content and media: it is essential that there be some 

        sort of process control to ensure that one site does not lag behind the 

        others, and that one site cannot be updated without the others, both in 

        terms of copy (textual content) and media content (still images, movies, 

        logs and so on). </p>

      <p>This type of problem is normally addressed in software engineering by 

        a version-control system, and for the Duyfken Web site we require a site-versioning 

        system that permits multiple concurrency. What is needed is a system that 

        not only enables the recording of files and their provenance and physical 

        usage but also manages and preserves their contextuality and their semantic 

        usage. </p>

      <h1>The problem of Multiply-purposed Media</h1>

      <p>While the revised Web site has at its core a transfer to a fully data-driven 

        solution, its defining feature is that it is a metadata-driven solution. 

        If a Website is to fit into the general milieu of RDF in the CIMI schema, 

        the appropriate designation of semantic metadata to the media resource 

        is essential (Dunn, 2000 ; Perkins, 2001) . On a static Web site, the 

        metadata is assigned to the entire page, even if the significance of the 

        metadata is the denoting of particular media resources within that page. 

        In the context of dynamic delivery from a database and a media repository, 

        such as we have here, the metadata must be preserved and distributed at 

        artefact level, if individual items are not to be bibliographically lost. 

      </p>

      <p>The critical moment in the life of a media artefact is when it is semantically 

        bound, either directly to a purpose or by proxy to a purpose through a 

        document such as a Web    page. This is the only point at which intelligence 

        is applied in the form of the skill and judgement of the curator. As media 

        artefacts are at best only minimally self-referential, it is this act 

        of binding that enables automatic sorting, selection and retrieval of 

        sets of artefacts within the repository. The metadata derived from the 

        use then stands for and represents the artefact within the system.</p>

      <p>And yet, paradoxically, this act of representation is also necessarily 

        a &#145;lens of distortion&#146; (Lagoze, 2000) , and properly so - this 

        is how we can focus on salient details at the expense of details of generalities.  

        But this act of distortion means that in repurposing, the specific semantic 

        role metadata cannot be reused, because there is no logical reason for 

        assuming that this beneficial distorting of reality will be equally beneficial 

        to the role anticipated in the repurposing. In other words, although the 

        usages are themselves pertaining to the same artefact, they represent 

        different aspects of reality.</p>

      <p>Moreover, every subsequent reuse modifies the net effect of the pre-existing 

        usages. We have argued elsewhere that there must be a set of protocols 

        established in repurposing to ensure that meanings stored in multimedia 

        databases do not &#145;drift&#146; (Pigott, Hobbs, &amp; Gammack, 2001) 

        . </p>

      <p>There are two aspects of multimedia repositories that have implications 

        for metadata practice and artefact repurposing. At system level, we can 

        see that the repository has a telos, or purpose, and intended audience, 

        within its overall theme: adult and child versions of a museum site, or 

        subscriber and free versions of a digital library; or here, the four virtual 

        sites of the Duyfken project. At artefact level, we can consider the usage 

        pattern that the artefact follows throughout its life, through use, repurposing 

        and archiving, which has implications for the extent to which usage is 

        generic or specific, or lying at some stage in between. </p>

      <p>These twin dimensions require that we have two aspects to the metadata 

        also: the <i>teleological</i> to target the intended audience, and the 

        <i>abstractive</i> to ensure the correct level of specificity is used. 

      </p>

      <p>When we consider the teleological aspect, we can see that for each instance 

        of metadata usage, there must be a prescribed context of metadata usage, 

        which gives explicit instructions on what constraints are being used, 

        and how these rules are to be applied. This we can term the <i>metadata 

        frame of reference</i>, as that is what gives a meaning to the individual 

        usage. A proper program of metadata usage therefore involves the objects 

        for annotation, the instances of annotation, and the rules and keyword 

        sets (the authority set) to use for that annotation.</p>

      <p>When we consider the usage pattern aspect, we see that when a media artefact 

        first comes into contact with the repository, it is the decision of the 

        curator that determines its usage pattern, and hence the specific or general 

        nature of the metadata required. There are three main patterns:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <span class=msoIns><ins

datetime="2002-03-17T20:25"></ins></span>The <i>immediate permanent use</i> pattern 

          is where an artefact arrives and is immediately put to use. In this 

          case, it must be catalogued with metadata specific to that use. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The <i>immediate archive </i>pattern is where there is no immediate 

          use for the artefact, but it still has the potential for some later, 

          unspecified usage. Here the metadata needs to be general to enable the 

          artefact to be retrieved for a variety of purposes, none of which is 

          known at the moment of accession.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <span class=msoIns><ins

datetime="2002-03-17T20:25"></ins></span>The <i>immediate transitory use </i>pattern 

          is where the artefact is to be used for some short-term specific purpose 

          and then archived. Here the curator needs to strike a balance between 

          the short-term specific and long-term generic metadata.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p>There is a special case of usage pattern that we meet in the Duyfken 

        project: the <i>immediate concurrent use </i>pattern, where an artefact 

        has more than one semantic purpose <i>at the moment of accession</i> (permanent 

        or transitory). These parallel meanings will remain linked through at 

        least the initial part of the artefact&#146;s life. Here we need to have 

        multiple sets of specific terms, one for each purpose, and to be able 

        to manage and exploit that relatedness within the overall systematic of 

        organization and retrieval. </p>

      <p>When we superimpose the usage pattern of the artefact on top of its teleological 

        aspect, we meet with the problem of continuity and change described in 

        Pigott et al. (2001) , where we discussed the survival of authorial intent; 

        and in Gammack, Pigott, &amp; Hobbs (2001) . If early binding to a specific 

        use requires specific metadata, any later repurposing to another specific 

        use will require metadata specific to that use, a situation which is at 

        least potentially conflicting.  If the artefacts have been catalogued 

        with generic metadata, however, a later specific use can be accommodated. 

        This is exactly the problem that we must manage in establishing the systematics 

        of the virtual sites of the Duyfken Web site. </p>

      <h1>Parallel Metadata: a Prototype for the Revised Duyfken Web site</h1>

      <p>Our solution is built on a database that lets us represent concurrent 

        use in the Web site, in the form of parallel metadata for media artefacts 

        stored and maintained for the four virtual sites, so that the correct 

        version is available to be called upon for a particular site and language. 

        Over and above this base requirement, we need to ensure that we represent 

        the components in such a way that the site of which they are a part can 

        preserve its narrative structure, in order that we may call on those resources 

        in the correct context.</p>

      <p>We therefore have several clear objectives for the prototype:</p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">It must retain the existing style of the site, and permit it to expand 

          to four separate, yet parallel, sites.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">To accomplish this, it must permit separate sets of metadata for each 

          of the four concurrent usages (English language&#150;Australian site, 

          English&#150;NL, Dutch&#150;Australia, Dutch&#150;NL).</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">This metadata should fit into the industry standard practices of defining 

          and exploiting metadata in order that the local expenditure of effort 

          have a universal return.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <span class=msoIns><ins datetime="2002-03-17T20:25"></ins></span>There 

          should be a naturalistic process for the accession/cataloguing of media, 

          to permit an unobtrusive capturing of the metadata and its storage for 

          the appropriate virtual site.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">There should be a process for generating the Web pages in context 

          that gives rise to the dynamic delivery of the four separate virtual 

          sites, a process which should also ensure the &#145;narrative&#146; 

          of the particular site is preserved.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <p>When we modeled the database, we identified four main entities of interest: 

        Event, Setting, Place and Agent. The data model centres on the concept 

        of an EVENT. Events are things that happen; on the voyage, or before or 

        after it &#150; stages in building the replica, the departure and arrival 

        of the ship, individual passages and stays at ports, and the news and 

        events, including captain&#146;s log, that are mailed regularly to the 

        Web site.  Events are linked with other events through a recursive relationship, 

        as an event such as a stay at a port is also part of the larger event 

        of the relevant passage, which itself is part of the entire voyage. We 

        also note that since the Web site is itself part of the events of the 

        voyage, charting as it does its chronology and narrrative, the construction 

        of each Web page will also be recorded in the database as an event, and 

        the Web pages themselves stored as artefacts.</p>

      <p>Events occur at Places, such as ports or unnamed locations of latitude/longitude; 

        and in a particular Setting, which could be on the ship, a particular 

        part of the ship, or onshore. Events have Agents associated with them. 

        Agents can be individual people, crew positions, or collective groups 

        such as crew or land staff. Again, each of these entities is in a recursive 

        relationship with itself, as each place or setting may be a part of a 

        larger whole, and individual agents may be part of a group.</p>

      <p>The relationships identified among the entities enable the narrative 

        structure of the Voyagie site to be represented, as well as the more static 

        information present in the original site. Since all the main entities 

        are in recursive relationships, the inherent hierarchies in the Duyfken 

        voyage can be modeled. This allows us to extract more complex combinations 

        of information, for example getting connections between legs of the journey 

        and members of crew, via ports of call, and the watches of the night.</p>

      <p>In the Duyfken Web site, we have four virtual sites, consisting of the 

        combinations of two languages and two countries. So, for each physical 

        media artefact playing its particular role in the narrative, we need to 

        consider four sets of metadata. We can identify several possibilities 

        resulting from this:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The language is different, but the site makes no difference to the 

          metadata that is used. This occurs with the technical metadata, where 

          there is no interpretation involved, and also with the conventional 

          data in the Event, Place, Setting and Agent tables. This situation can 

          be accommodated by having dual language fields within the same record. 

          (Although this is a &#145;hard coding&#146; solution it is simplest 

          to manage and is justifiable here as it is unlikely that any other languages 

          will be required for the site.)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The site at which the artefact is used may impose a different interpretation 

          on it. For example, the same image could be captioned differently in 

          the Netherlands and in Australia. This involves not just language translation, 

          but a different set of semantic metadata. For this situation, we use 

          four parallel metadata records. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> If the interpretation or translation required for a site involves 

          editing or copying the artefact, we end up with multiple physical artefacts: 

          for example, each entry in the Captain&#146;s Log/Scheepsjournal is 

          stored as two separate documents. Each document, being a separate artefact, 

          would then require dual language fields for the technical metadata and 

          four parallel records for the semantic metadata, as described above.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Process for Accessioning</h2>

      <p>The Web site, and therefore the database which underpins it, is a live 

        chronicle of events. The selection of media for a section of the narrative 

        is done by a series of page wizards, permitting searching for material 

        either generally or specifically, and from the perspective of an entity 

        or from a unified set based on the metadata. An interesting challenge 

        here is to present multiple possibilities for keyword or character/place 

        referencing without losing the flow of the selection process. </p>

      <p>The Web pages are designed to have zones of placement, as close to the 

        current Duyfken site as possible. Use of a cascading style sheet in conjunction 

        with the stored text permits a set of different semantically purposed 

        page regions, each with content that is apposite and current. The use 

        of summary textual metadata permits &#145;headlines&#146; to be created, 

        and serve as keyholes to the pages where the information is given in full, 

        and also from each section to a set of previous entries for that section. 

        This fits in nicely with the image of the site as a narrative chronology, 

        similar to that in old Amsterdam. There is a strong publishing feel to 

        the site, which enhances its feeling of vitality and immediacy.</p>

      <p>The new Web site will have curators in each country whose responsibility 

        it is to add the media and data to the database. Although there need to 

        be four &#145;virtual curators&#146;, one for each site, the roles could 

        be filled by anything from one to four or more individuals; thus in the 

        following discussion, &#145;curator&#146; refers to the appropriate virtual 

        curator. The secure access of the existing site will be continued, and 

        curators will be required to log in with passwords. </p>

      <p>Media artefacts and notification of events will arrive regularly, as 

        the voyage progresses, and the database, media repository and Web pages 

        will be updated at the same time, in the context of the ongoing narrative.  

        Figure 13 illustrates the logical process of accession of media and data 

        and the delivery of Web pages. </p>

      <p><a name="fig13"></a><a href="towlerfig13.html"><img src="towlerFig13.jpg" height="458" border="0" alt="Process for accessioning" width="401"></a></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 13: Process for accessioning<br>

        (<a href="towlerfig13.html">detailed image</a>)</p>

      <p>The new site is &#145;event driven&#146;, and there are three different 

        kinds of stimulus from the world that the curator must respond to:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> The arrival of new media artefacts, such as images or an e-mail of 

          the Captain&#146;s Log. These artefacts will always be part of the context 

          of an event, whether new or previous.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> An event happening, such as arrival at a port (which may or may not 

          have accompanying media).</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> A general need for updating the site.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p>Each of these stimuli is a trigger that causes the curator to be notified, 

        using internal messaging, that the system requires  attention. We will 

        now describe each of these processes in turn. </p>

      <p>When new media artefacts arrive, there is likely to be a surplus of artefacts, 

        and the first judgement of the curator will be one of appropriateness 

        of the artefact (be it still image, recording, e-mail, movie) to the immediate 

        site narrative. In some instances (the Captain&#146;s Log is the main 

        one) the artefact is immediately needed for all locations (and in the 

        case of the log, it must be translated and a separate document created). 

        With a set of volunteer images of a stay at a port, on the other hand, 

        it may be that only three images out of 20 would be used. </p>

      <p>The next question arises as to the usage status and the metadata requirements 

        of the remainder. As discussed previously, there will be a tradeoff between 

        very specific metadata for immediate use, and more general metadata for 

        archival use.  The artefacts that are immediately archived are often going 

        to be very similar to the ones selected for immediate use, and a level 

        of description and keywording will be aimed for to permit a general location, 

        but perhaps not the detailed analysis of action and character of an artefact 

        designated for immediate use.</p>

      <p>It is essential that every artefact receive its full complement of parallel 

        metadata, and that this process be managed. A system of locking will ensure 

        that it is impossible for more than one curator simultaneously to access 

        and catalogue the same artefact, and a set of pages inserted after the 

        initial accession pages present in the original facilitates the addition 

        of the metadata. The metadata will be drawn from best practice technical 

        metadata requirement and the selected semantic role metadata sets. </p>

      <p>The first curator to respond to the message would be the one to add metadata 

        from an agreed set, with &#145;place-holding&#146; metadata put in the 

        system for subsequent curators. The place-holding metadata will be generic 

        rather than specific, and will be in the appropriate language for the 

        usage, drawn from key-paired thesaurus and similar wordsets, wherein every 

        entry in the thesaurus will have a Dutch as well as an English term. The 

        titles, descriptions and other free text will have to be left with a translator, 

        or team of translators, who will be delegated the individual tasks automatically 

        by internal messaging.  The next point in the chain is a form of &#145;copying-on&#146;, 

        whereby the archived (not immediately used) artefacts are given some of 

        the used, generic, metadata automatically (Figure 14).</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><a name="fig14"></a><a href="towlerfig14.html"><img src="towlerFig14.jpg" width="402" height="662" border="0" alt="Curatorial workflow."></a><br>

        Figure 14. Curatorial workflow.<br>

        (<a href="towlerfig14.html">detailed image</a>)</p>

      <p>The second curator on the scene follows the same process of selecting 

        from the artefact set and accepting or amending the default metadata, 

        and if necessary adding specific metadata. It may also be that the second 

        curator finds an alternative artefact in the batch to suit their purposes 

        better, in which case, the two sites will not have identical media artefact 

        usage.</p>

      <p>The artefacts are all placed into a media repository, which is automatically 

        mirrored, and updated daily. This ensures that there are no bandwidth 

        constraints in the delivery of media for analysis.</p>

      <p>As the media artefacts will always added be in a context &#150; the context 

        of an event, agent, place or setting &#150; the possibility of adding 

        a new record to the database tables at the same time has to be taken into 

        account. Again, the first curator would enter the information, and the 

        other language version would be delegated to the translators.</p>

      <p>The second case that the curator must respond to is when events occur 

        and trigger an update to the database but without accompanying media. 

        In this case, the curator may need to search through the existing media 

        repository to locate suitable media artefacts for illustration. </p>

      <p>Finally, there is always the need for the Web site to be fresh and interesting 

        for visitors, so in the absence of any new media or events to be recorded, 

        it may be necessary for the curator to write copy on more general themes. 

        This could be prompted on a time or calendar basis. Here the curator may 

        need to search the database for suitable media and perhaps also for &#145;stories&#146; 

        from the records of events. </p>

      <p>After the completion of each update of a Web page at a virtual site, 

        the creation of the page is itself recorded as an event and the Web page 

        is stored as part of the media repository. An interesting side-effect 

        of the Web site creating dynamic pages as a chronicle is that the contents, 

        while dynamic, are representative of their period of currency, and so 

        themselves become the subject of harvesting and storage. It is interesting 

        to consider whether the individual pages will require the direct attention 

        of the editor for adding metadata &#150; presumably the requirement for 

        internal monitoring of the site could well have this as a clear benefit, 

        with the response of the site to certain events being indicated with candour 

        for internal purposes where they would not have been evident  from the 

        site itself.</p>

      <p>What distinguishes the Duyfken project is the need for the parallel versions 

        to remain concurrent in time throughout the constantly dynamic process 

        of updating the narrative. Ideally, updates to the four virtual sites 

        would be handled as a single transaction, so that no version lags behind 

        the others. In practice, however, it may be necessary to set a timeout 

        period so that if for any reason a curator fails to respond to a message 

        by posting an update, the remaining sites are not held up indefinitely.</p>

      <h2>Implementation</h2>

      <p>The Web site is currently on a Windows NT server using ASP, with a perl/mysql 

        backend delivering media as required. There is a hybrid ECMAScript (JavaScript) 

        and ASP development environment, showing the different stages of the project 

        development, as described in the introduction. The initial prototype, 

        replacing the Voyagie/ship's journal section, was done with the Pasigraphy 

        scripting environment (developed by D. Pigott) and had the data in Microsoft 

        Access tables under IIS5. </p>

      <p>The next stage, the pilot project, makes use of a straightforward ASP/ADO 

        format, designed and managed through Microsoft FrontPage. The interoperability 

        of IIS 5 with FrontPage and the relative ease of use for the non-technical 

        user will make it possible for the curators to experiment with alternative 

        features in relative safety, due to the componentisation of the design. 

        The choice of this platform was made partly for reasons of continuity, 

        and partly with a view to making a generalisable solution that would be 

        usable elsewhere. The tables are currently in a SQLServer7 backend, but 

        upgrading to SQLServer 2000 presents no challenges at all. </p>

      <p>The movement of files is done via HTTP Upload to avoid any potential 

        confusion associated with standard UNIX ftp. The exchange of metadata 

        and the new entities is done automatically by time-triggered stored procedures, 

        while the inter-curatorial communication is done by an internal, project-style, 

        messaging system. It is hoped that by designing the system to be scalable, 

        there will be no barrier to repurposing the system itself.</p>

      <p>The design of the database was done using the entity-media modeling methodology 

        (Hobbs &amp; Pigott, 2002) and the process of designing for concurrency 

        is described in Hobbs, Pigott &amp; Towler (in prep). An unusual feature 

        of the design is the recursive nature of the four principal entities involved, 

        which has led to an unusually adaptable system for querying and producing 

        network reports. The parallel metadata as required for the virtual sites 

        is stored using dual language fields for technical metadata and conventional 

        data, and separate records for semantic metadata. Keyword sets with linked 

        terms are used to accommodate the complex nature of bilingual synonymy.</p>

      <p>In terms of the choice of media artefact formats, although the Duyfken 

        project is to a large degree archival, there has had to be a trade-off 

        between the needs of archiving material (long term, guaranteed readability, 

        multiple store, etc) and the needs of the site, which is to be maximally 

        viewable, with an optimum download. Certainly the Duyfken voyage is of 

        interest to places where it calls on its way, and there is a responsibility 

        of the site to permit easy viewing for those on the other side of the 

        digital divide. Moreover, there has been no way of guaranteeing a single 

        standard for quality where some of the digital material is volunteered, 

        and already arrives in a digital format. The choice to date has been to 

        opt for high quality JPEG formats, QuickTime VR and HTML4 compliant text. 

        With the transition to the new site, the needs of longevity are probably 

        better served by continuity, due to the massive task of retroconversion. 

        Certainly, embracing formats such as fractal compression or wavelet compression 

        ahead of their general availability in browsers would go against the Web  

        site&#146;s principle of universality of access.</p>

      <h1>The Duyfken Web Site and Resource Discovery</h1>

      <p>The late-binding use of media and text resources in the revised Web site 

        not only makes for timeliness and accuracy, but also makes it possible 

        to have an inventory of the entire media resource pool, and the benefits 

        that entails. Not only are there savings in time and money through the 

        reuse of media artefacts, but we are also moving towards an environment 

        of repurposing and media discovery, and the increased semantic richness 

        that arrives with that discovery.  It is the intention that (though the 

        pages are dynamically created) the Duyfken Web site be a source for Dublin 

        Core compliant harvesting, to permit discovery by other museum and historical 

        presences on the Internet. But in facing up to the challenges this presents, 

        some problems are immediately apparent. </p>

      <p>The IFLA FRBR common logical method for metadata presents the information 

        resource in one of four states: Work, Expression, Manifestation and Item 

        (Bearman, Miller, Rust, Trant, &amp; Weibel, 1999) . It s not straightforward 

        to fit the work of the Duyfken Web site into this paradigm, however, for 

        several reasons. </p>

      <p>The fundamental nature of the DC paradigm is of works of cultural significance 

        being described and accessed, reflecting its bookish and artistic heritage. 

        This is not readily applicable to our situation. The artefacts are not 

        necessarily of worth in themselves, and there is a documentary rather 

        than an artistic presence on the Web site (this is not to deny the aesthetic 

        worth, but rather to describe its direction). There is no real creator 

        or authorship of importance, but rather the <i>story</i> itself is the 

        main bearer. The sailors themselves are telling the story through their 

        actions, and that is the authorial component that should be stressed. 

      </p>

      <p>Neither is there any manifestation of importance. The presence of the 

        media artefacts here are all of an illustrative nature: here we are concerned 

        with trying to represent events, and artefacts are chosen for their ability 

        to represent that narrative, rather than for any significance in themselves.</p>

      <p>That said, what can we gain from the insight of the OAG and the DC? Certainly 

        the paradigm of interoperability is crucial here: permitting the discovery 

        of information through judicious use of RDF, and through the appropriate 

        access to properly accessioned media artefacts in a repository, is the 

        responsibility of the conscientious cultural store point-of-presence &#150; 

        so what can be asked of the site itself in this paradigm? Here we find 

        resource discovery not so much between the harvester and the site components, 

        but as part of the harvesting of the site itself as a resource; so metadata 

        practice should have as its first priority harvesting of the site as a 

        narrative rather than individual points of access to the site. </p>

      <p>Perhaps it would be more appropriate to consider the types of requests 

        that might be made of the repository in actual use. Here questions would 

        be asked of the site as of an expert on Dutch maritime history, so the 

        resources could be exposed and harvested in the form of specific rather 

        than general queries. Not so much &#145;what media have you available&#146; 

        as &#145;what can you tell me about this subject in particular?&#146; 

        This goes back to our earlier discussion of how metadata information should 

        be prepared for early and late binding use.</p>
