      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Information about current projects, events and developments 

        taking place at the interface of media art and technology can be found 

        anywhere on the Internet. Since existing information channels simply concentrate 

        on specific user groups,  virtually no cross-speciality, interdisciplinary 

        exchange takes place.  The aim of netzspannung.org is to establish an 

        on-line centre of expertise for media art, design and technology to promote 

        an interdisciplinary exchange between art and technology. This in turn 

        will make advanced media technology available as a highly productive resource 

        for the world of art, and equally will make artistic strategies accessible 

        for the development of media technology.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Keywords: netzspannung.org, interdisciplinary exchange, 

        interface, media technology, media art.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>In order to reach this goal, netzspannung.org is establishing a collaborative 

        knowledge space for media art and technology, and is developing an infrastructure 

        for networked productions. In specific terms, this means the establishment 

        of a distributed, modularly-arranged infrastructure aimed at facilitating 

        collaboration, the development of a knowledge map system as an innovative 

        strategy for generating knowledge, and the provision of on-line workspaces 

        for netzspannung.org&#146;s users. The aim of this article is to introduce 

        these modules. </p>

      <p>In addition, netzspannung.org offers an open channel known as the netzkollektor. 

        With time, this will develop into a showcase for contemporary media culture 

        where artists, theorists, informaticians and curators can present their 

        own current projects. Users can present &quot;professional profiles&quot; 

        and, in doing so, contribute to building up a database of experts. These 

        modules, which function as a producers&#146; gallery or producers&#146; 

        agency, form a comprehensive pool of information and expertise in conjunction 

        with netzspannung.org&#146;s curator-based areas. </p>

      <p>The modules aimed at facilitating networked production include eMUSE 

        (the Electronic Multi-User Stage Environment), i2TV (the interactive Internet 

        TV) and a mobile streaming laboratory. A software platform for theatre 

        and dance productions, eMuse converts real and virtual space into a shared 

        action space, thus providing a basis for trying out experimental media 

        spaces.  The interactive Internet TV is a tool for implementing a conference 

        format that includes on-line and on-site conference participants with 

        equal involvement in the conference happenings. The streaming laboratory 

        forms the basis for being able to use eMUSE and i2TV anywhere and for 

        linking to the Internet platform. The modular structure of netzspannung.org&#146;s 

        system architecture also provides a basis for networked productions. Therefore, 

        netzspannung.org is working on creating a collaborative knowledge space 

        on the Internet, and linking this virtual knowledge space with real-time 

        events. In this context, the streaming laboratory represents a facility 

        for integrating new content into the knowledge space, while i2TV offers 

        both the special Internet participation facilities for conference members 

        and a truly special form of event documentation.</p>

      <h1>The Collaborative Knowledge Space</h1>

      <p>For netzspannung.org, the term &#145;collaborative knowledge space&#146; 

        is a multi-layered concept involving the productive interplay of previously 

        discrete areas. The platform combines the production and presentation 

        of artistic projects, editorial and open information modules, artistic 

        approaches and technological research &#150; all aimed at developing new 

        forms of knowledge and new ways of presenting and discovering knowledge. 

        One key question in all this is how existing archive and information pools 

        can be merged to form a single, extended knowledge space. </p>

      <p>To link the knowledge space set up by netzspannung.org with existing 

        media-cultural archives, a technological solution has to be developed 

        &#150; an archive adapter &#150; which will interlink various archives. 

        Then comes the task of developing visualization models which will establish 

        relationships among the various pieces of information and make them explorable. 

        In this way distributed archives can be searched from a single point. 

        To demonstrate this capability, netzspannung.org and the archive of the 

        International Media Art Award (organized by SWR and ZKM) are currently 

        connected.</p>

      <p>By networking cultural institutions it is possible jointly to build up 

        comprehensive information pools on artists and their work and to present 

        the combineddata to the public. Information pools of this type essentially 

        have an open structure which permits contributions to be made from outside 

        and facilitates links with other disciplines. The extent of such archive 

        networks requires new strategies  to make content more intuitive to explore 

        and to provide users with points of orientation, possibilities for interaction 

        and customized memory or &quot;work&quot; spaces. On-line archives and 

        exhibitions on the Net should therefore be thought of as action spaces 

        for users. </p>

      <p>To link the various activities and projects in the fields of media art, 

        media culture and media technology and create innovative strategies for 

        forming knowledge spaces, a structure that can be expanded with other 

        servers and databases is also needed. Instead of a centralized database 

        structure, netzspannung.org is developing a distributed system. Its modular 

        structure consists of a data level, an applications level and an interface 

        level, meaning that netzspannung.org users are able to produce and participate 

        on different levels &#150; namely at the applications, interface or content 

        level. </p>

      <p>Below, the knowledge map system is described first. This is an innovative 

        strategy aimed at creating links among content items. Two interfaces which 

        use different principles to represent knowledge spaces and make them intuitively 

        navigable are then introduced.</p>

      <h1>The Knowledge Map System</h1>

      <p>The interdisciplinary orientation of netzspannung.org makes it necessary 

        to contextualize heterogeneous content from art and technology. The process 

        of linking media-cultural archives also means it is necessary to systematize 

        and visualize content outside of customized database structures. To manage 

        the immense volume of information which arises when archives are linked 

        together, a transparent and explorable visualization process, designed 

        with growth in mind, has been developed.</p>

      <p>In order to implement a system capable of meeting these requirements, 

        netzspannung.org has incorporated the very latest research in knowledge 

        management and knowledge discovery and has developed the Knowledge Map 

        System. The technologies of the Semantic Web are used to automatically 

        communicate between heterogeneous contents and the systematics of different 

        archives.  Instead of firmly defined categories, a neural network generates 

        clusters of related content based on the semantic analysis of texts. The 

        objective is to identify and visualize inherent semantic structures in 

        different texts and types of text (research reports, descriptions of art 

        projects, theoretical texts).  As part of the multi-stage text analysis, 

        the Knowledge Map System initially evaluates the relative frequency of 

        individual words and translates these into vectors which are characteristic 

        for each text. A neural network then determines the similarities among 

        the vectors and provides a basis for graphic representation in a Kohonen 

        Map. This representation forms the basis of the graphical user interfaces 

        that open up and explore the underlying information pool. System-generated 

        contextualization of content provides the basis for an open &#150; i.e. 

        augmentable &#150; cartography which, in some cases, can reveal hidden 

        relationships in an intuitive structure. </p>

      <p>There are a number of factors that are crucial for building up a digital 

        knowledge space.  These include the organization and structuring of knowledge 

        and its implementation in a media-appropriate form. In developing interfaces 

        for exploring collaborative knowledge space and identifying new relationships, 

        it was important to incorporate the users&#146; cognitive level, the  

        recipients' emotional involvement level, and the visual communication 

        level. The interface must make users curious and provide models that can 

        be used to simplify complexity. After all, interaction is not just part 

        of the reading process, but also part of the process of constructing meaning. 

        Key importance therefore attaches to &quot;staging&quot; aspects when 

        new knowledge forms are to be generated in non-linear structures. Thus 

        netzspannung.org has developed two interfaces which support intuitive 

        exploration of the cooperative knowledge space:  the Semantic Map and 

        netzspannung.org/timeline.</p>

      <h1>The Semantic Map </h1>

      <p>The Semantic Map is a multi-stage interface which combines system-generated 

        contextualization with traditional methods of systemization. The first 

        application for the Semantic Map visualized all the media art, media culture 

        and media research projects selected at the cast01//Living in Mixed Realities 

        conference (<a href="../http://netzspannung.org/cast01/semantic-map/index.html">http://netzspannung.org/cast01/semantic-map/index.html</a>).</p>

      <p>The overview of the Semantic Map derives from the Kohonen Map.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> 

        </span> These maps are self-organizing neural  networks (Kohonen, 2001).<sup> 

        </sup> All the texts recorded by the system are presented in full view. 

        This means that all texts are linked to all other texts and are grouped 

        into clusters depending on their similarity. The contents of the clusters 

        are outlined by displaying the most dominant keywords. When a keyword 

        is selected, all the projects this keyword is assigned to are displayed, 

        thereby allowing targeted navigation along individual terms.</p>

      <p>The second navigation level places the individual project or the selected 

        text at the heart of the representation. This &quot;zoom view&quot; displays 

        contents related to the selected project, their relative distance from 

        the project reflecting the semantic relationship discovered by the system. 

        This is visualized in graphic form. A short distance on the graphic interface 

        indicates a close semantic connection between the texts. This second navigational 

        level also offers an entry point for users wishing to negotiate projects 

        presented in the semantic map by starting with a project with which they 

        are familiar in order to first get to know the environment of this specific 

        project. The keywords assigned to the projects represent system-generated 

        terms and terms which were given specific assignments at the input stage. 

        Colour coding of the two keyword systems makes it possible to compare 

        user-defined keywords with those generated by the Knowledge Map System. 

      </p>

      <p>The &quot;zoom view&quot; leads on to the third information level which 

        provides more detailed accounts of the projects. At the current time, 

        it distinguishes between brief information, content description, technical 

        description and context, where the term 'context' covers exhibitions, 

        research contexts, bibliographical references and references to related 

        projects. It would also be possible, however, to output the data fields 

        in a completely different interface and, for example, to focus on the 

        presentation of audio and video files.  </p>

      <p>In order to provide users with a means of orientation, navigation is 

        maintained by the Semantic Map for the duration of a session and is documented 

        as a trace in the overview. Projects once focused are thus highlighted 

        and can be located with ease. </p>

      <h1>The Timeline Interface</h1>

      <p>The possibilities opened up by electronic media &#150; in the form of 

        hypertext and interaction &#150; require the development of new concepts 

        for timelines as graphic displays of historical developments along a time 

        axis. An initial demonstrator of the timeline interface of netzspannung.org 

        presented the contributions at the cast01 / Living in Mixed Realities 

        conference, and was used as an interactive conference program guide. (<a

href="../http://netzspannung.org/cast01/timeline">http://netzspannung.org/cast01/timeline</a>)</p>

      <p>In contrast to the relationship with the Knowledge Map System, the y-axis 

        categories of the netzspannung.org timeline interface are not system-defined, 

        but are defined instead by the moderator and form the main framework for 

        presenting a selection of projects. The juxtaposition of different themes 

        creates a picture of the issues that are relevant at a given time. Navigation 

        and scalability enable users to define their own points of focus when 

        exploring a large data space. This need to establish an unambiguous assignment 

        of projects to y-axis categories results in clearly structured content, 

        but also represents the problematic nature of the interface. Unambiguous 

        assignments are often difficult to achieve. </p>

      <p>Flexible systemization of content is therefore provided on the second 

        navigation level. Taking a selected project, it is possible for each specified 

        keyword to generate a separate timeline which depicts in chronological 

        order all projects  assigned the selected password. The netzspannung.org/timeline 

        therefore contains a potentially unlimited number of time axes. The rigid 

        systematization on the first information level is extended by flexible 

        contextualization on the second navigation level.</p>

      <p>The netzspannung.org/timeline is also the second interface of the Knowledge 

        Map System. The clusters replace firmly defined categories, and the contents 

        of the system-generated clusters are depicted in the chronological sequence 

        in which they were generated. </p>

      <h1>On-line Workspaces</h1>

      <p>The concept of a collaborative knowledge space doesn&#146;t just describe 

        an innovative strategy for combining and contextualizing knowledge and 

        making it explorable. To give artists, curators and interested users the 

        opportunity to get actively involved in the process of generating knowledge 

        and finding logical relationships, personal on-line spaces are provided. 

      </p>

      <p>In the initial phase, these offer users various facilities for modifying 

        and extending their own contributions in the netzkollektor or in the database 

        of experts. In a second phase, it becomes possible to set up a private 

        information pool. Finally, the functions of the knowledge discovery interface 

        &#150; i.e. the visualization and contextualization of heterogeneous information, 

        along with the ability to permanently integrate new data automatically 

        &#150; can also be applied to the private information pool. The knowledge 

        discovery interfaces become tools in personal workspaces. </p>

      <p>As a workspace tool, the semantic map will offer a facility for creating 

        personal knowledge maps. The system-generated contextualization of content 

        provides the user with an alternative view of the contributions he has 

        collected. In specific terms, this means putting his ideas or selected 

        projects in a new context and checking which links the knowledge map system 

        reveals compared to the conventional perspective. </p>

      <p>If the user does not agree with the assignment of one project to a specific 

        cluster, he can assign the project to another cluster by moving the icon 

        into another cluster or by generating a new one. This means that any users 

        can extend the clustering found by the system  by including their own 

        knowledge of relationships. This gives rise to personal knowledge maps 

        which represent their creators&#146; points of view and knowledge. The 

        system learns the changes made by users. If other projects are integrated 

        into the semantic map, the system takes account of the users&#146; changes 

        when a new project is being assigned to a specific cluster. The personal 

        knowledge maps then become tools. With these knowledge maps, it becomes 

        possible to navigate an unknown information pool by displaying the unknown 

        content automatically in the user&#146;s personal knowledge map. The knowledge 

        map serves as a type of semantic structuring model which is applied to 

        an unknown data pool and visualizes it automatically in user-specific 

        structuring. </p>

      <p>The combination of media-cultural knowledge space with personal on-line 

        workspaces also provides a basis for developing new on-line exhibition 

        concepts which link presentation space with personalised memory space 

        when users create their own references or make comments. </p>

      <h1>Prospects</h1>

      <p>On the one hand, the concept of collaborative knowledge space means linking 

        existing media-cultural archives in a single information space and making 

        the new construct searchable at one specific point. On the other, netzspannung.org 

        is working in conjunction with media technology researchers and art-based 

        strategies to develop new systems that automatically structure comprehensive 

        information pools and make them navigable through intuitive interfaces. 

        This represents a key approach for giving users the opportunity to enjoy 

        active use of knowledge in on-line workspaces. </p>

      <p>The described collaborative knowledge space model in conjunction with 

        the i2TV system for connecting on-site and Internet participants, and 

        the mobile streaming laboratory, provide a basis for new strategies of 

        culture communication in networked spaces.</p>
