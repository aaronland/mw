      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>Two Minnesota art museums have developed a statewide network for training 

        teachers to integrate ArtsConnectEd, an internet-based educational resource, 

        into traditional classrooms and teaching techniques.  This paper will 

        examine the design and implementation of a train-the-trainer program designed 

        to promote the use of <a href="../http://www.artsconnected.org/">www.artsconnected.org</a> 

        (a Web site developed jointly by The Minneapolis Institute of Arts and 

        Walker Art Center) in classrooms across the state of Minnesota.</p>

      <h1>The Evolving Partnership</h1>

      <p>The partnership between the Education Departments of The Minneapolis 

        Institute of Arts (MIA) and the Walker Art Center began in 1995 when each 

        museum designed catalogues of educational resources for teachers and mailed 

        them together in one envelope.  The joint mailing required that the museums 

        collaborate on design so that the catalogues would visually represent 

        the different institutions and fit together at the same time. The mailing 

        also required that the museums pool their mailing lists and share mailing 

        costs.  The response from the K-12 teaching community in Minnesota was 

        very positive. Teachers expressed the sentiment that finally the two largest 

        art museums in the state had quit competing with each other and had focused 

        together on serving teachers.</p>

      <p>As the Web emerged, each museum also made its catalogues available electronically 

        through its Web site. Simultaneously, some of the material listed in the 

        catalogues was being converted for on-line delivery. For example, World 

        Mythologies, a slide set available to rent through the MIA&#146;s Classroom 

        Materials Office, was converted for on-line distribution in 1995 (<a href="../http://www.artsmia.org/mythology">http://www.artsmia.org/mythology</a>).  

        Originally the on-line catalogues and other electronic teaching resources 

        were straight HTML.  As interest in these resources grew, so did the desire 

        to make the material searchable. In addition, both museums began to digitize 

        their art collections to participate as founding members of the Art Museum 

        Image Consortium (<a href="../http://www.amico.org/" target="_blank">http://www.amico.org</a>). 

        In 1997, the Minnesota Office of Technology began offering funding to 

        encourage the development of on-line resources. During this year, technology 

        staff from the MIA and Walker met to explore on-line project ideas that 

        might overlap, address State funding requirements, and further bolster 

        each museum&#146;s commitment to on-line resources. The Integrated Art 

        Information Access Program, later renamed ArtsConnectEd, was the product 

        of these meetings. Thus the partnership that began with educational resource 

        catalogues was leveraged to create a resource that would eventually provide 

        full educational access to collections and resources of both museums through 

        one Web site.</p>

      <h1>Technical Grassroots</h1>

      <p>ArtsConnectEd grew to become a portal to the combined digital resources 

        of the MIA and Walker, including works of art, educational resources, 

        audio, video and text archives and library catalogues. The educational 

        resource catalogues that were the birth of the partnership and funding 

        opportunities offered by the Minnesota Department of Education (now called 

        the Department of Children, Families and Learning), MCI Worldcom&#153; 

        and the Institute of Museum and Library Services motivated the technologists 

        to consider K-12 educators a primary audience. In 1997, the Minnesota 

        Department of Children, Families and Learning awarded ArtsConnected $1 

        million to continue its work putting the collections of both museums online.</p>

      <p>Both the Walker and the MIA were struggling to address growing demands 

        to put traditional print-based educational resources into the hands of 

        educators, and ArtsConnectEd was designed to provide an unlimited 24/7 

        means of addressing those demands. By design, ArtsConnectEd was presenting 

        educational material in a new way, and in order to make use of these new 

        on-line resources, the museums quickly realized that they would have to 

        make an investment in helping teachers gain greater confidence and competency 

        in using technology and the Internet.  Wiring of schools in Minnesota 

        and nationwide was moving quickly, and ArtsConnectEd developers assumed 

        that access would increase as quickly as new resources were generated. 

        Furthermore, providing rich educational resources on-line would encourage 

        teachers to gain the economic resources, skills, and tools to access them.  

        ArtsConnectEd was able to make a case as an investment in technology and 

        education, and in 1999 ArtsConnectEd received an additional grant of $2 

        million to continue its work for and with teachers. </p>

      <h2>Interface Design</h2>

      <p>ArtsConnectEd began with the idea that using query, similar to Google 

        as the primary interface for searching the collections of both museums, 

        would best serve the audience of K-12 teachers. The wisdom of this design 

        strategy was investigated in 1998 when the usability of an early version 

        of ArtsConnectEd was formally tested. Findings from the usability lab 

        indicated that the search engine interface was problematic for teachers 

        for two primary reasons. First, ArtsConnectEd returned too many disparate 

        results for teachers to make sense of; and second, in 1998 most teachers 

        didn&#146;t possess the skills to perform sophisticated searches. Following 

        usabilty testing, technologists began prototyping new interfaces designed 

        to better suit teachers&#146; needs, and enlisted the help of usability 

        experts and the museum educators at both institutions to determine components 

        of the interface. The resulting interface, publicly released in the fall 

        of 1999, incorporated resource-specific queries, wizard/assistants and 

        menus to better meet the needs and requirements of the K-12 educational 

        audience.</p>

      <h2>Management by Committee</h2>

      <p>As the usage, care and feeding of ArtsConnectEd began to grow, a more 

        formal team structure was needed to set and obtain long-term project goals. 

        Four committees composed of representatives from both the MIA and the 

        Walker were established to achieve these ends: Steering Committee, Technology 

        Committee, Education Committee and Marketing Committee. The Education 

        Committee faced two immediate challenges. First, the Committee was responsible 

        for defining new content and resources to be made available on ArtsConnectEd. 

        Second, strategies were needed to persuade the K-12 teaching community 

        to embrace ArtsConnectEd as a new centralized on-line resource. Recognizing 

        that it wasn&#146;t good enough to simply provide the resource, the Education 

        Committee began to explore strategies of training teachers to use ArtsConnectEd.</p>

      <h1>A State-wide Training Strategy</h1>

      <h2>Equitable distribution</h2>

      <p>The state of Minnesota is 84,068 square miles and contains 341 school 

        districts to serve a population of 4,610,000. The MIA and Walker are located 

        in the most densely populated urban area of Minneapolis.  Both museums 

        distribute educational resources such as slide sets, posters and videos 

        in five regional centers around the state, but the majority of Minnesota 

        educators outside the Twin City area were grossly under-served. The need 

        to address the inequities between the Twin Cities and the rest of the 

        state was of primary importance for the ArtsConnectEd Education Committee, 

        as well as the state legislature who wanted their investment in ArtsConnectEd 

        to reach all of Minnesota.  In order to secure additional funding from 

        the state, the museums needed to design their teacher training program 

        to impact all of the state of Minnesota.</p>

      <h2>Part Marketing, Part Training</h2>

      <p>The ArtsConnectEd Education Committee identified two initial goals for 

        developing a state-wide teacher training program.  First, to promote the 

        use of ArtsConnectEd in classrooms around Minnesota, awareness of ArtsConnectEd 

        had to increase. A training strategy that would simply market knowledge 

        of ArtsConnectEd to the largest number of people possible was desirable. 

        Second, the ArtsConnectEd Education Committee acknowledged that teachers 

        would benefit from coaching and support to learn to use ArtsConnectEd. 

        Previous experiences with teachers in advisory groups and workshops for 

        teachers had convinced the Education Committee that teachers find it hard 

        to create time in their regular classroom schedule to learn to use a new 

        resource. Providing teachers time to learn to use ArtsConnectEd in a workshop 

        setting might help address the problems teachers have finding time on 

        their own for such professional development.  Teachers also frequently 

        told museum staff that they aren&#146;t given adequate support in school 

        buildings or school districts to learn new skills or to learn to use new 

        equipment. ArtsConnectEd teacher training could supply the support that 

        teachers need in their use of technology and relieve school districts 

        of some staff development pressures felt around technology in the classroom.</p>

      <h2>The Train-the-Trainer Model</h2>

      <p>The ArtsConnectEd Education Committee began its design of a state-wide 

        teacher training program by considering a traveling resource model such 

        as Plains Rolling Art Gallery (<a href="../http://www.plainsart.org/education/rpag.shtml">http://www.plainsart.org/education/rpag.shtml</a>) 

        or Experience Music&#146;s Electric Bus (<a href="../http://www.emplive.com/visit/electricbus/index.asp">http://www.emplive.com/visit/electricbus/index.asp</a>). 

        This approach required that a trainer travel the state providing workshops 

        for teachers in their own communities. However, this strategy had a &#147;here 

        and gone&#148; impact without lasting support, and one trainer could reach 

        only a small number of teachers.  The alternative approach of a train-the-trainer 

        model was conceived, using a pyramid system to reach as many teachers 

        as possible throughout Minnesota. </p>

      <p>The train-the-trainer model is based on one lead trainer developing a 

        highly skilled core group of teachers from around the state, who would 

        in turn conduct workshops in their regions. After consulting lobbyists 

        and administrators of both museums, the Education Committee chose to recruit 

        a core group of 24 teachers, 18 from around the state and six from the 

        Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area. Members of this core group would contract 

        to teach at least four workshops of 15 teachers each after they were trained, 

        so 24 trainers would workshop 60 teachers each, resulting in a grand total 

        of 1440 Minnesota teachers trained to use ArtsConnectEd in their classrooms 

        during the 2001-2002 school year. Theorizing that each teacher is responsible 

        for at least 30 students during a school year, the Education Committee 

        estimated that students using ArtsConnectEd could reach 43, 200 during 

        2001-2002. </p>

      <h2>Project Budget<u></u></h2>

      <p>ArtsConnectEd money was dedicated to three primary areas: 1) the continued 

        digitization and conversion of works of art and archives, 2) the development 

        of new content in the form of on-line educational resources, and 3) the 

        statewide teacher-training program. </p>

      <p>While the Education Committee conceived the strategies of the overall 

        training program, its design was facilitated through external contractors. 

        Staffing in the figures below is non-museum staffing. Materials for training 

        are included in the cost per trainer.<u></u></p>

      <h1>ArtsConnectEd Training Plan</h1>

      <p class="normal">Once the model for the training program was determined, 

        the Education Committee examined its resources and decided that each trainer 

        would receive a Macintosh G3 Powerbook computer in order to ensure equal 

        access to standardized equipment and software. The computer would serve 

        as both a tool as well as an incentive when formally awarded to the trainers 

        once they had successfully completed the program. Each trainer would also 

        receive reimbursement for lodging and mileage and a $200 stipend to travel 

        to Minneapolis for three training sessions in 2001.  In return, the trainers 

        would commit to use ArtsConnectEd with their students in the classroom, 

        as well as plan and deliver four ArtsConnectEd workshops in their regions 

        during the 2001-2002 school year. Trainers would receive a $200 stipend 

        for each workshop they conducted and an overall expense account of $500. 

        During the two-year training period the trainers would also participate 

        in an on-line threaded discussion list with the lead trainer and each 

        other, as well as participate in an evaluation of the program.</p>

      <h2>Lead Trainer</h2>

      <p class="normal">In the summer of 2000, the Education Committee set about 

        crafting a job description and began the search for an ArtsConnectEd Lead 

        Trainer. The job description required the lead trainer to design and deliver 

        a training program that would instruct and support 24 teachers from all 

        parts of the state in conducting ArtsConnectEd workshops for their colleagues 

        in their home regions. The Lead Trainer would be responsible for developing 

        both print and electronic training materials and classroom assessment 

        models, and would moderate the threaded discussion list with the 24 trainers 

        using <i>WebBoard </i>software. To simplify the potentially complex reporting 

        structure, it was decided that the Lead Trainer would report to the Director 

        of Education at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, and attend meetings 

        of the ArtsConnectEd Education Committee.  Once the 24 trainers were fully 

        trained, the Lead Trainer would observe the workshops they provided for 

        their peers and work with a contracted evaluator to study the effectiveness 

        of the training program.</p>

      <p class="normal">The Education Committee identified the following qualifications 

        for the Lead Trainer: 1) a licensed art educator experienced in teaching 

        with technology and in developing online teacher resources; 2) previous 

        experience working with art museums; 3) knowledge of the Minnesota community 

        of educators; and 4) willing to travel to various parts of Minnesota to 

        observe each of the 24 trainers in action. A former MIA Education staff 

        member who was also a licensed art educator was hired. The selected Lead 

        Trainer had previously worked with both museums on ArtsNetMN (<a href="../http://www.artsconnected.org/artsnetmn" target="_BLANK">www.artsconnected.org/artsnetmn</a>), 

        a joint project involving K-12 education resources delivered over the 

        Internet, and had served as Minnesota&#146;s Museum Education Representative 

        on the governing board of the state&#146;s professional organization, 

        Art Educators Minnesota, for K-12 art educators. In addition, the selected 

        Lead Trainer had demonstrated experience developing Performance Packages, 

        Minnesota&#146;s method for assessing students&#146; fulfillment of the 

        Minnesota High School Graduation Standards.</p>

      <p class="normal">Because the Lead Trainer was a temporary contract position, 

        the Lead Trainer&#146;s relationship to permanent museum staff would need 

        to be a transitional one. The Education Committee recognized the importance 

        of developing a continuing relationship between the 24 teachers and the 

        two supporting museums once the funded training program was completed.  

        To accommodate this transition, each museum selected a member of its education 

        staff to attend all training workshops and work closely with the Lead 

        Trainer to ensure continuity.  The Lead Trainer was given a museum e-mail 

        address (acetrainer@artsmia.org) to enable a seamless transition between 

        the temporary Lead Trainer and permanent education staff after training 

        was over. An assistant trainer was identified on staff at the MIA to serve 

        as a liaison between the Lead Trainer and in-house museum services and 

        procedures.</p>

      <h2>Trainer Recruitment Strategy and Application Process</h2>

      <p class="normal">Once contracted, the Lead Trainer worked with the ArtsConnectEd 

        Education Committee to develop the application procedure for teachers 

        interested in becoming one of the 24 trainers. The Committee decided to 

        target art teachers in their recruitment strategies in order to promote 

        the art education profession in Minnesota.  As in other areas of the country, 

        art education is often the first to be cut in times of tight budgets. 

        In Minnesota, many elementary schools go without art specialists, leaving 

        classroom generalists with little training to fill the bill. The Education 

        Committee reasoned that recruiting art specialists to become ArtsConnectEd 

        experts would be a statement of support for the profession and a leg up 

        for art specialists who were often shut out of access to technology in 

        favor of more &#147;technical&#148; subject areas like business or science.</p>

      <p class="normal">Another consideration for the Education Committee was 

        whether to target teachers who needed education in technology and inspiration 

        to use technology in the art classroom, or to target those teachers who 

        were already technology savvy and had demonstrated leadership in the field. 

        Although the pros and cons for each recruitment strategy made sense, in 

        the end the Education Committee chose to recruit leaders in the field, 

        hoping to inspire others through the examples set by the trainers.</p>

      <p class="normal">The Education Committee wanted to develop an application 

        package that would fully inform applicants of all aspects of the program, 

        and at the same time wanted to avoid handing out packages that would be 

        discarded by teachers who didn&#146;t qualify or weren&#146;t interested 

        once they realized the necessary commitment. To address this concern, 

        a two-step application process was developed in which an applicant formally 

        requested an application package, and then completed the application. 

        The following advertisement was placed in folders handed out at the fall 

        conference for Art Educators of Minnesota. It was also sent to the state&#146;s 

        mailing list of art educators and the state&#146;s Best Practices Network, 

        a group of 50 arts teachers assembled from all over the state who are 

        knowledgeable about the research on best practices for effective teaching 

        and learning in the arts.</p>

      <div> 

        <p class="BlockQuote">Wanted: ArtsConnectEd Trainers</p>

        <p class="BlockQuote">Creative and experienced teachers are wanted to 

          train colleagues to use the online art resources found in ArtsConnectEd 

          in classrooms throughout Minnesota. ArtsConnectEd is a partnership between 

          The Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Walker Art Center that provides 

          Internet access to the rich collections and educational resources of 

          both institutions through one shared Web site.  Using the power of the 

          Internet to stimulate new approaches to learning, the goal of ArtsConnectEd 

          is to help make arts education timely, engaging, interactive, and pertinent 

          for both teachers and students of all ages.  The goal of this project 

          is to create a community of teachers and learners who are able to use 

          web-based arts resources creatively and effectively.</p>

        <p class="BlockQuote">ArtsConnectEd trainers commit two years to this 

          training project, agreeing to complete 3 one and one-half day training 

          sessions in the Twin Cities during the first year (travel stipend provided).  

          Year two requires trainers to organize and teach a minimum of 4 three-hour 

          workshops to teachers in greater Minnesota.  12 qualified teachers who 

          represent diverse Minnesota regions will receive Macintosh G3 Powerbook 

          laptop computers, $600 stipends for year one and $200 stipends for each 

          workshop taught during year two, plus a $500 materials budget.</p>

        <p class="BlockQuote">Applicants must have demonstrated experience teaching 

          art in a classroom setting (grades 4 -12) and demonstrated experience 

          with computers and Internet technology including access to an Internet 

          Service Provider.  Evidence of professional leadership and a letter 

          of support from school administrators is also required.  <u>For application 

          materials, contact:&#133;</u></p>

        <p class="BlockQuote"><i>The Minnesota Department of Children, Families 

          &amp; Learning through an appropriation by the Minnesota State Legislature 

          is a major funder for many of the resources that have been developed 

          for ArtsConnectEd.</i></p>

      </div>

      <p class="normal">The application packet (see Appendix A) consisted of a 

        letter detailing the commitment a trainer would need to make if selected 

        and the application procedure.  In order to ensure that applicants had 

        the blessing of their school administrator, a letter of support was also 

        required with the completed application. School support was considered 

        crucial, since selected teachers would require substitutes on days when 

        they were teaching workshops in other parts of their communities. The 

        application form required applicants to specify which grades they taught.  

        The Education Committee had determined that trainers would be chosen from 

        those teaching grades 4-12 since ArtsConnectEd wasn&#146;t designed for 

        use by preschool children or the very young grades K-3.  Thus an art teacher 

        responsible for grades K-6 in a large elementary school fit the target 

        applicant profile more than a teacher responsible for grades K-4 in a 

        smaller school.</p>

      <p class="normal">In order to gauge an applicant&#146;s familiarity with 

        art museums and the resources they provide for teachers, a question was 

        included on the application regarding the teacher&#146;s prior experience 

        with museum educational materials. The applicant&#146;s demonstrated leadership 

        history was required in terms of memberships in professional organizations 

        and awards or honors, as well as a short essay outlining their philosophy 

        in regard to the integration of technology in classrooms. A series of 

        questions was included about how often the applicant used the Internet 

        to determine the applicant&#146;s comfort and familiarity with Internet 

        resources. Finally, each applicant was also required to sign a statement 

        saying that they read and understood the job description, to avoid having 

        applicants who later withdrew over misunderstandings regarding what was 

        required.</p>

      <p class="normal">150 requests for applications were received by the December 

        1, 2000 deadline, and 89 completed applications were received by the December 

        15, 2000 deadline. Each application went through an initial screening 

        process in which applicants who didn&#146;t fit the recruitment criteria 

        of teaching in grades 4-12, and applicants who indicated that they never 

        used museum resources or never used the Internet, were eliminated. The 

        geographic &#147;home&#148; of the remaining applicants was plotted on 

        a map of Minnesota. The Education Committee met and reviewed the remaining 

        applications, choosing 24 based on the criteria of geographic location, 

        qualities of leadership, experience training teachers, and on the essays 

        regarding the use of technology in the classroom. As a final check, at 

        least one of the two references listed on each of the 24 finalists&#146; 

        applications was contacted. The applicants who were not selected were 

        sent &#147;thank you&#148; letters and a gift of catalogues of the MIA&#146;s 

        collection and the Walker Sculpture Garden.</p>

      <p class="normal">The 24 trainers selected hailed from all over the state 

        of Minnesota with the exception of the very southwest corner (a trainer 

        later moved to this area in a job change that began in the 2001-2002 school 

        year). 18 trainers represented non-metro areas and 6 trainers represented 

        the Twin Cities and surrounding suburbs.  Among the ranks was the president 

        of the state&#146;s professional organization for art teachers and an 

        art history teacher from the Perpich Center for Arts Education, an arts 

        high school serving 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> grade students 

        from all over Minnesota.  The group represented a distribution of elementary, 

        middle and high school art teachers. All were informed at their first 

        training meeting in February 2001 that they would be required to sign 

        a contract with ArtsConnectEd (see Appendix B) for their work over two 

        years.</p>

                    who represented herself as an art teacher was, in fact, a 

                    social studies teacher. Despite these potential setbacks,

      <p class="normal">A marketing firm was hired to develop a marketing plan 

        and materials for ArtsConnectEd teacher-training during year two when 

        the trainers were in the field teaching their workshops. An ArtsConnectEd 

        poster and three-ring-binder were developed before the 2001-2002 school 

        year began, enabling trainers to use posters to market workshops and binders 

        to be filled with customized material for each workshop.  A media kit 

        was developed and the marketing firm tracked the workshops as they were 

        scheduled on the threaded discussion list.  As each workshop was scheduled, 

        the marketing firm sent a media kit to the host community&#146;s press.

      <h2>Program Goals</h2>

      <p class="normal">Once the 24 trainers were selected the Education Committee 

        interviewed and contracted an evaluator specializing in outcome-based 

        evaluation to design an evaluation of the train-the-trainer program as 

        well as one for the workshops the trainers would teach in year two.  The 

        evaluator helped the Education Committee and the Lead Trainer identify 

        the following overall goals for the training program: 1) create a collaborative 

        laboratory for exploring meaningful classroom applications of on-line 

        teacher resources; 2) create a community that will sustain the use of 

        on-line teacher resources throughout Minnesota; 3) build bridges between 

        the cultures of the classroom and the art museum; 4) increase the sophistication 

        of teachers&#146; use of on-line teacher resources; and 5) expand teachers&#146; 

        use of technology in general.</p>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Reinforce the trainers&#146; 

          commitment to use ArtsConnectEd with their students.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <p class="normal">In February of 2001the trainers arrived at the MIA for 

        their first one-and-a-half-day training session.  The group of 24 had 

        been split into two groups of 12 to allow for more individual contact 

        time with the Lead Trainer.  Each group of 12 would remain together throughout 

        the training in an effort to build community among the trainers. To promote 

        a professional attitude, business cards were made for each trainer and 

        were placed at their seats along with the agenda for the session and the 

        contracts they were required to sign (Appendix B).  The following trainers&#146; 

        version of the goals for ArtsConnectEd teacher training was reviewed with 

        the group:</p>

      <p class="normal">After completing three training sessions in 2001 ArtsConnectEd 

        Trainers will:</p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">create an ongoing collaborative 

          laboratory in which criteria for effective classroom use of ArtsConnectEd 

          is discovered, developed, discussed and tested.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> work as a team to create and 

          evaluate 24 classroom tasks that demonstrate effective classroom use 

          of ArtsConnectEd.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">increase technological proficiency 

          and aptitude to advocate for increased access to art resources and technology 

          in K-12 classrooms.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> develop skills that provide leadership 

          in arts education in Minnesota.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <p class="normal">In addition, trainers were informed that over the course 

        of their training they would work with the Lead Trainer to build a &#147;tool 

        kit&#148; containing skills, materials and resources that they could later 

        draw upon to create effective, high quality workshops for their peers 

        in year two. Once the &#147;house-keeping&#148; was out of the way, the 

        computers were distributed and the rest of the day focused on a series 

        of activities aimed at building overall computer confidence and increasing 

        trainers&#146; familiarity with the specifics of their new tool. One of 

        these exercises included the installation of additional memory, previously 

        purchased for each computer but left for the trainers to install. Each 

        trainer was taught to remove the laptop&#146;s keyboard and install the 

        new memory in the machine.  This &#147;under the hood&#148; experience 

        proved a powerful icebreaker, and anyone who was intimidated by the new 

        computer before this experience felt a much greater sense of technical 

        confidence.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Fig.5: Trainers install memory in their new computers</p>

      <p class="normal">Day two began with breakfast and a question and answer 

        session at the Walker Art Center. Mid-morning, the trainers moved back 

        to the MIA to learn how to configure their computers to access the Internet 

        via both network and dial-up connections.  Development of on an on-line 

        ArtsConnectEd tutorial had begun prior to the first training session and 

        the trainers were asked to beta test the program while simultaneously 

        learning about ArtsConnectEd.  After lunch the trainers were provided 

        with a field trip behind the scenes at the museum where they followed 

        a work of art from the galleries to the digital photography studio to 

        the computer where the metadata related to the digitized image was input 

        for inclusion in the ArtsConnectEd Web site. </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Fig. 6: Trainers visit the MIA&#146;s digital photography 

        studio</p>

      <p class="normal">Beyond providing an in-depth understanding of the internal 

        work process behind ArtsConnectEd, this experience helped cement the trainers&#146; 

        relationship with the museum, making them feel more like museum staff 

        and less like outsiders looking into ArtsConnectEd. Back in the classroom 

        trainers were taught to use ArtsConnectEd&#146;s threaded discussion list 

        software (<i>WebBoard</i>) and received their assignments for the period 

        until the next training session: use ArtsConnectEd in the classroom with 

        your students, and report to each other about your trials via the threaded 

        discussion list.</p>

      <h2>Session Two</h2>

      <h3>Goals for Session Two</h3>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Continue to build bridges of understanding 

          between the cultures of the museum and the classroom.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Develop criteria for effective 

          classroom use of ArtsConnectEd based on classroom trials with students.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Brainstorm a list of task ideas 

          with trainers based on classroom trials with students.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Align task ideas with the Minnesota 

          Graduation Standards using SPACE chart tool.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Communicate a procedure for each 

          trainer to write a draft of a task using ArtsConnectEd in a K-12 classroom.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <p class="normal">Session two of ArtsConnectEd training began in March of 

        2001 with a tour of the art storage vaults at the MIA.  The MIA Registrar 

        who lead the tour introduced the trainers to the vast holdings of the 

        museum that were not on public view but only available via electronic 

        access.  This exercise helped reinforce the unique entrance that ArtsConnectEd 

        provides to the entire collection, well beyond the 3-5% of works currently 

        hung on the gallery walls.   The Registrar also provided the trainers 

        with information about the lengths that museums go to in order to properly 

        preserve and care for works of art.  The experience furthered the goal 

        of immersing the trainers in the mission and culture of museums. Following 

        the tour, each trainer reported on classroom trials with ArtsConnectEd, 

        and several had related student work to share. </p>

      <p class="normal">The second goal for the trainers: &#147;work as a team 

        to create and evaluate 24 classroom tasks that demonstrate effective classroom 

        use of ArtsConnectEd&#148; was introduced with a definition of a &#147;task.&#148;  

        The Lead Trainer had considered that several tasks might be bundled to 

        create a Performance Package, the assessment tool used by the state to 

        determine whether students were meeting Graduation Standards. (Minnesota 

        has since abandoned Performance Packages as its mandated assessment tool, 

        leaving individual school districts to decide on or design tools to measure 

        student achievement.) The task format allowed for the creation of smaller, 

        more manageable units of instruction than traditional lesson plans.  A 

        task form was developed and explained so trainers would be familiar with 

        the end product of their goal.</p>

      <p class="normal">Trainers brainstormed ideas for tasks based on their trials 

        with ArtsConnectEd in the classroom. Once an initial list had been developed, 

        the evaluator led the group to determine criteria for an &#147;effective&#148; 

        classroom task. Trainers discussed and determined the following criteria:</p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <span class="MsoBodyText"><ins

datetime="2002-03-17T12:12"></ins>ArtsConnectEd is required to complete one or 

          more components of the classroom task.</span></span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <span class="MsoBodyText"><ins

datetime="2002-03-17T12:12"></ins>Classroom learning outcomes are evident in the 

          task.</span></span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <span class="MsoBodyText"><ins

datetime="2002-03-17T12:12"></ins>All tasks are aligned to the Minnesota Graduation 

          Standards.</span></span></li>

        <li class="MsoBodyText"><span class="MsoBodyText">All tasks can be assessed.</span></li>

        <li class="MsoBodyText"><span class="MsoBodyText">Use of ArtsConnectEd 

          in the task is planned for a range of available technology.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Some tasks are designed to accommodate 

          a diverse range of learners.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <h2 align="center"><img src="sayre17web.jpg" width="320" height="240"></h2>

      <p class=MsoCaption> Fig.7: Trainers use Post-It notes to brainstorm task 

        ideas</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Once the criteria were agreed on, the group measured 

        each task idea against the criteria and revised or discarded task ideas 

        that didn&#146;t measure up.  To determine whether tasks aligned to the 

        Graduation Standards (criteria #3), the large group split into smaller 

        groups with SPACE charts for each of the learning areas such as math, 

        inquiry, history, etc.  SPACE stands for &#147;Some Processes and Concepts,&#148; 

        a series of skill sets developed by the State of Minnesota to represent 

        for teachers the necessity to teach students <i>how</i> to think about 

        a topic area rather than <i>what</i> to think. Each group took a set of 

        task ideas and attempted to place them in the appropriate grade level 

        and learning area on SPACE charts designed especially for this activity. 

        (See Appendix D) If the trainers could find a solid fit between a task 

        and a SPACE Chart, the task was considered aligned to the Graduation Standards.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">A final list of all task ideas that met all of the 

        defined criteria was placed on the threaded discussion list after trainers 

        returned to their schools, and each trainer signed up to formally write 

        up one task in the predetermined form.  Once all the trainers adopted 

        a task idea to write about, each received a blank task form, a set of 

        written instructions for completing the task form, the SPACE chart that 

        accompanied the task they selected, and a sample completed task form. 

        (Appendix D) Trainers were instructed to bring a final task draft to their 

        final training session in June to be critiqued by the group.</p>

      <h2>Session Three</h2>

      <h3 class="MsoBodyText">Goals for Session Three</h3>

      <ol>

        <li class="MsoBodyText"><span class="MsoBodyText">Continue to build bridges 

          of understanding between the cultures of the museum and the classroom.</span></li>

          reporting on workshops completed during year two.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Session three of ArtsConnectEd training began in 

        June of 2001 with a tour of the archives at Walker Art Center.  The archives 

        house documentation of works of art over the history of the Walker, including 

        artists&#146; models, film, video and audio recordings of performances, 

        correspondence concerning commissioned work or artist residencies, etc. 

        Next, trainers attended a briefing session with the marketing firm hired 

        to promote ArtsConnectEd throughout the state during year two. The marketing 

        firm set up procedures to call attention to trainers&#146; activities 

        around the state, and presented the designs for binders, the press package 

        and the ArtsConnectEd poster they had prepared for trainers&#146; use.</p>

      <h2 align="center"><img src="sayre2web.jpg" width="320" height="240"></h2>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Fig.8: Trainers review resources in their final training 

        session</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">That afternoon, the trainers received instructions 

        on care, use and shipping procedures of two LCD projectors purchased for 

        trainers to use in their workshops.  A reservation system was set up using 

        the threaded discussion list, where trainers would schedule shipment of 

        the projectors to workshop sites. On day two of the final training session, 

        each trainer distributed copies of the task they had written for group 

        feedback. Following the group discussion, each trainer had two weeks to 

        make final revisions based on the group feedback and submit the final 

        written tasks.  Over the summer, an editor edited the tasks and a graphic 

        designer laid out any accompanying handouts.  These final versions were 

        compiled in an on-line database that the trainers accessed beginning in 

        the fall of 2001.  The trainers could print any of the 24 tasks via the 

        database for distribution in their ArtsConnectEd workshops. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Procedures for reporting were discussed and a list 

        of all the tools the trainers had acquired over the course of the training 

        was distributed as a reminder of the resources they could draw upon once 

        they were out in the field giving workshops (see Appendix E). At the conclusion 

        of the session a special ArtsConnected summer conference was announced.  

        This one-day conference would serve the purpose of uniting the two groups 

        of 12 trainers for the first time as well as teach skills that were beyond 

        the scope of ArtsConnectEd, such as basic Photoshop and Web site design.</p>

      <h1>The Evaluation</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">A three-prong evaluation plan was developed for assessing 

        the effectiveness of training the trainers.  First, a pre-survey and a 

        post-survey were developed to measure the growth of the 24 trainers&#146; 

        skills before and after their training.  Second, an observer recorded 

        the instructional techniques used and their effectiveness, during each 

        of three training sessions. Third, after each session, the trainers were 

        asked to reflect on and evaluate their training by answering questions 

        on the threaded discussion list. All of the results from each session 

        were compiled, analyzed and shared with the trainers to enable them to 

        make use of what was learned in the evaluation when constructing their 

        own workshops. </p>

      <h2>Survey Results</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The pre- and post-surveys measured quantifiable skills, 

        and the results from those surveys showed that the trainers acquired the 

        skills they needed to successfully transfer their knowledge of ArtsConnectEd 

        to other teachers. Above all, the survey showed that Art Collector, a 

        tool in which users build their own art collections, saw the greatest 

        growth in use over the course of the training period. (See Appendix C) 

      </p>

      <h2>Observation Results</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The observers at each training session identified 

        the following teaching techniques over the course of the trainers training:</p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Observing a demonstration</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Clicking along on your own while 

          the instructor provides instructions</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Group Show and Tell Presentations 

          (trainers share their own experiences)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Handouts (paper and electronic)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Field trips out of the classroom 

          for a behind-the-scenes museum experience</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Group discussions</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Hands-on knowledge and skills 

          gained (as in installing computer memory)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Electronic ArtsConnectEd Tutorial</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Modeling a process</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Cooperative learning where trainers 

          teach each other</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Group Critiques</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Lecture</span></li>

      </ol>

      <h3>Results from Questions on the Threaded Discussion List</h3>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The list of teaching techniques above was posted 

        on the threaded discussion list and trainers were asked to identify which 

        technique or set of techniques helped them learn the most.  They responded 

        that the combination of ALL techniques used was most effective.  The training 

        observers confirmed this finding by tracking the level of the group&#146;s 

        engagement throughout all of the techniques.  When techniques were varied, 

        most of the group was engaged and on task. The trainers concluded that 

        effective workshops make use of all techniques so that all learning styles 

        are addressed. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In response to questions about what worked well during 

        their own training, trainers identified learning computer tricks such 

        as keyboard shortcuts and search tips as one of the ways that their confidence 

        as computer users was increased. Their confidence as museum users increased 

        when behind-the-scenes information was shared.  These two techniques combined 

        and repeated over time resulted in the trainers becoming more confident 

        ArtsConnectEd users.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Using handouts was also emphasized as a powerful 

        teaching tool, one that addressed different learning styles and provided 

        backup for information given in instruction.  Trainers used handouts most 

        often to review information or look up instructions after training, and 

        many said that they just didn&#146;t &#147;get it&#148; until they were 

        able to see it on paper.  In fact when trainers were asked what could 

        have been done to improve their own training experience, the response 

        was &#147;more handouts!&#148; The Education Committee had developed a 

        written and illustrated full-color Teacher&#146;s Guide to ArtsConnectEd 

        before the teacher-training program began, and trainers embraced this 

        guide as a basic handout for all their workshops. (Download the guide 

        at <a href="../http://www.artsconnected.org/classroom" target="_blank">http://www.artsconnected.org/classroom</a>)</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">When the trainers were asked what was learned using 

        ArtsConnectEd in their own classrooms, they reported that students were 

        impressed that the works of art they were seeing on-line could be found 

        in their own state.  Since ArtsConnectEd training was taking place statewide, 

        all the trainers began to emphasize that works of art were in Minnesota 

        museums and students responded with excitement. A number of trainers from 

        outside of the Minnesota metro area reported that some of their students 

        influenced their families to travel to the Twin Cities just to see the 

        original works of art they had studied in class.<span class="MsoBodyText"><b><i><br>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Once trainers were introduced to ArtsConnectEd in 

        session one of their training, the Lead Trainer began to put scavenger 

        hunts in the threaded discussion lists, requiring trainers to conceive 

        of sophisticated search strategies to solve specific problems. The trainers 

        identified this opportunity to practice searching as an essential element 

        that helped them become more advanced ArtsConnectEd users overall. Providing 

        opportunities to practice searching was also a technique they considered 

        essential to effective workshops.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">When asked to pinpoint times when they were most 

        engaged, trainers recalled the periods when they were able to interact 

        with and learn from each other. Making meaning relate to students at a 

        personal level has long been a goal of expert teachers. Tasks and rewards 

        that were meaningful personally as well as professionally were also identified 

        by the trainers as influential teaching tools. Finally, the trainers articulated 

        importance to their overall sense that museum staff and the Lead Trainer 

        treated them with respect and thought of them as professionals.  Often 

        the trainers said they strove to behave more professionally because they 

        were treated as professionals. </p>

      <span class="MsoBodyText"></span> 

      <h2>Task Evaluation</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The 24 tasks written by the ArtsConnectEd trainers 

        were evaluated by a team consisting of the evaluator, Lead Trainer, and 

        an education staff member from the Walker and the MIA.  The evaluator 

        designed a rubric based on the criteria for effective classroom tasks 

        (see session two), and three members of the evaluation team scored each 

        task.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The resulting scores show that the tasks scored highest 

        in aligning with the Graduation Standards, an exercise that included using 

        a concrete, hands-on tool. The evaluation team was disappointed that the 

        tasks did not score higher on other criteria, and they also expressed 

        the sentiment that overall many of the tasks did not meet museum educators&#146; 

        idea of quality activities. The educators on the evaluation team who had 

        previous experience working with teachers writing museum materials cited 

        similar disappointments in the past.  </p>

      <p><span class="MsoBodyText">One theory as to the perceived short-coming 

        of the teacher generated tasks was cultural differences.  Classroom teachers 

        are naturally focused on process, switching strategies and changing techniques 

        as a result of the instant feedback they get from students to find &#147;what 

        works.&#148; Thus there is a focus on what works in the classroom, not 

        how that process is expressed in a written document.  On the other hand, 

        museum educators function in an environment based on academic tradition, 

        where an end product like a research paper or exhibition represents the 

        process that created it. Museum educators respect editorial feedback and 

        go through many revisions and discussions about semantics in order to 

        achieve a final product they can be proud of. Because these two &#147;cultures&#148; 

        are so disparate, the Education Committee wondered if the idea of requiring 

        teachers to achieve museum standards of &#147;quality&#148; was misguided. 

        While the discussion is still taking place, one conclusion is that there 

        needs to be more thought about museums respecting teachers and the culture 

        they practice in, not expecting teachers to understand or embrace museum 

        culture. </span> </p>

      <h2>Evaluating Trainers&#146; Workshops</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The evaluation of the trainers&#146; workshops was 

        conducted via a two-page survey that the trainers required their workshop 

        participants to fill out and hand in at the end of each workshop. In addition, 

        each trainer was required to reflect in the threaded discussion list on 

        what went well and what could have gone better during each workshop. The 

        evaluator designed a follow-up phone interview for a random sample of 

        those who attended ArtsConnectEd workshops, to be conducted in February 

        of 2002, to determine the effectiveness of the workshops in creating ArtsConnectEd 

        users. The data collected to date has been distributed to trainers so 

        they can make use of it in their future workshops in 2002.  The data also 

        will be used in planning future ArtsConnectEd initiatives with teachers.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">To date there have been 100 workshops scheduled for 

        the 2001-2002 school year, and 75 of those have already taken place.  

        Many trainers used contacts they had in their areas to schedule workshops 

        during the school district&#146;s staff development days, while other 

        trainers took advantage of events already planned such as state conferences 

        that accepted proposals for presentations.  Almost all trainers have planned 

        workshops for other staff in the buildings where they teach, and every 

        college in the state that graduates teachers has been contacted with great 

        success with offers of training pre-service teachers. Over 700 people 

        who have attended workshops filled out evaluation forms, and the data 

        has been very positive:  99% say they have acquired the skills and knowledge 

        they need to use ArtsConnectEd, and 73% say they acquired the skills and 

        knowledge they need to use ArtsConnectEd in their classrooms.  A full 

        summative analysis of the outcomes of these workshops will be developed 

        in fall of 2002.</p>

      <h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

      <h2>Museum Fellowships</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In the spring of 2002, ArtsConnectEd trainers will 

        have an opportunity to apply for two summer fellowships to develop and 

        complete individual projects related to the goals of ArtsConnectEd and 

        technology use in K-12 art classrooms.  The application process will allow 

        the ArtsConnectEd Education Committee to choose two projects they feel 

        will benefit the museum&#146;s programs while simultaneously strengthening 

        the fellows&#146; understanding of art museums and their role in the education 

        community.</p>

      <h2>Higher Education Symposium</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">ArtsConnectEd will also seek to partner with a Minnesota 

        College or University to host a symposium on the use of Web-based resources 

        in K-12 education for all faculties of Minnesota colleges where teachers 

        are educated.  The goal of the symposium will be to continue to challenge 

        Minnesota colleges to produce teachers who are prepared to advocate for 

        and take full advantage of technology-rich classrooms in the future.</p>

      <h2>Advanced Regional Workshops</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">All Minnesota teachers who attended one of the teacher-trainer&#146;s 

        ArtsConnectEd workshops during the 2001-2002 school year will be invited 

        to one of three regional ArtsConnectEd workshops in the 2002-2003 school 

        year.  Designed by museum staff, these workshops will take ArtsConnectEd 

        users to advanced levels, building on skills learned from the teacher-trainers.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Possibilities for continued or expanded training 

        continue to be explored. While art teachers are perhaps best equipped 

        to understand the value of art museums, there are many potential interdisciplinary 

        applications of ArtsConnectEd.  Art teachers require in-depth understanding 

        of other disciplines to be able to teach to teachers of other disciplines.  

        Expansion of teacher training might mean exploring interdisciplinary work 

        with teachers other than art teachers. </p>

      <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">While the ArtsConnectEd Education Committee is still 

        analyzing the teacher training and formulating what has been learned, 

        some initial lessons can be brought to light. Teachers are in great need 

        of continuing professional development when it comes to using technology 

        in the classroom. ArtsConnectEd trainers were selected for their familiarity 

        with technology; even so, they demonstrated during their training sessions 

        that their knowledge, skills and confidence in working with technology 

        were very diverse.  This diversity of skills was what drove the need for 

        a wide range of instructional strategies and techniques. Museums would 

        do well to consider this diversity in skills when developing on-line resources, 

        by designing a range of tools and interfaces for accessing electronic 

        materials.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Giving ArtsConnectEd trainers a look behind the scenes 

        of the museum created dedicated fans who delighted in discovering and 

        exploring all the roles that art museums play. Many of the trainers said 

        that their students anxiously awaited their reports concerning new facts 

        uncovered and new secrets revealed about storing, caring for, collecting 

        and displaying works of art. Art museums might have great success making 

        new connections with current visitors and potential visitors by revealing 

        more of the inner workings of the museum to an obviously fascinated public.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Teachers need to be considered professionals, but 

        unfortunately they aren&#146;t always treated that way.  ArtsConnectEd 

        staff learned that when teachers are treated as professionals, they become 

        more committed, more enthusiastic and more willing to go the extra mile 

        for their students &#150; whoever their students are.  Supplying teachers 

        with up-to-date materials, professionally produced, and expecting professional 

        behavior created an atmosphere of respect and dedication among the ArtsConnectEd 

        teacher-trainers.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Different from traditional prepackaged tours, reproductions 

        and materials, comprehensive on-line resources, particularly those providing 

        access to the museum&#146;s collection, provide a drastically new paradigm 

        for art educators incorporating the arts works into many aspects of daily 

        classroom life.  Watching teachers learn to use ArtsConnectEd became like 

        watching teachers and students use a doorway from the school into an art 

        museum.  But on-line museum resources like ArtConnectEd can be more flexible 

        for teachers than an art museum.  In ArtsConnectEd it is possible to search 

        through storage, organize your own exhibition and write your own labels. 

        Giving teachers museum materials has always been a good idea, but giving 

        teachers tools to access museum collections and all they have to offer 

        provides a more powerful connection.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Finally, as for the train-the-trainer model itself, 

        while the number of teachers and students impacted is impressive in its 

        own right, the long-term impact has yet to be measured. The ultimate goal 

        of sustained and meaningful use of ArtsConnectEd in classrooms across 

        Minnesota as a result of workshops offered by the ArtsConnectEd trainers 

        seems within reach, but documented attainment of that goal is in the future.</p>
