      <p class=MsoPlainText align=center><b>Abstract</b></p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Over the last year the J. Paul Getty Trust's Web presence 

        has evolved from a group of disparate, independently maintained Web sites 

        into a homogenous consistently branded one - getty.edu. This transformation 

        recently culminated with the implementation of a leading Content Management 

        System (CMS). There were and are many process-changes and challenges in 

        implementing a CMS in an institution such as the Getty.  These issues 

        are not unique and span the gamut from social, to business, to technical. 

        This paper will highlight the major issues, describe the route the Getty 

        took, and give an insight into the functionality and capability of a leading 

        CMS application for a content-rich museum Web site.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Keywords: Content Management, Templates, Workflow, 

        Virtualisation, XML.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>The Getty is a campus of six programs: Museum, Research Institute, Conservation 

        Institute, Trust Administration, Grant Program and Leadership Institute. 

        All these programs contribute content for the Web site, resulting in a 

        very content-rich environment. It currently includes details on 4,000 

        works of art; 1,500 artist biographies; 3 hours of streaming video; past 

        and present exhibitions; art historical research papers and tools; conservation 

        research papers and tools; on-line library research tools; detailed visitor 

        information; an event calendar, and a parking reservation system.</p>

      <p>Up until a year ago, each program independently maintained its own portion 

        of getty.edu. A gateway homepage was placed at the top level, but as soon 

        as one drilled down into the Website, it was immediately apparent that 

        there was no consistent design, navigation, or look and feel, and no way 

        to navigate around the site without going back to the homepage.</p>

      <p>A trustee-level decision was made to present the Web site with a consistent 

        design and look and feel - a Web group was formed and charged with this 

        task. Accomplishing this task would include the implementation of a Content 

        Management System (CMS) to ensure that all the programs could continue 

        to contribute content to the Web site but in a managed and decentralized 

        way. Rather than implement the redesign and CMS simultaneously, the redesign 

        was implemented first, but significant effort was assigned to preparing 

        the HTML pages for later CMS integration.</p>

      <p>The Web site was re-launched in February, 2001, with a unified design 

        and functionality and a more thematic treatment of the content. The task 

        had required that the webgroup temporarily &#145;own&#146; all the content 

        and the processes associated with getting that content to the Web. The 

        knowledge gained during this process was crucial in being able to identify 

        the real requirements of any CMS that the Getty would need to implement.</p>

      <h1>Maintenance Burden</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>There was a significant burden to re-launching the 

        Web site before implementing a CMS. To guarantee that ongoing development 

        and maintenance on the Web site adhered to the new rules and style guide, 

        all content still had to funnel through the webgroup - the new design 

        had committed us to a frequent subsite update regime. The GartnerGroup, 

        whom the Getty use to benchmark themselves against similar organizations 

        and business processes, publish a graph which exactly summed up where 

        we stood in the Web life-cycle. Even with a webgroup of 18 people, there 

        were few resources to develop new content.</p>

      <h1>Preparing For a CMS</h1>

      <p>To prepare the Getty community for a CMS, which might take 6-9 months 

        to select, the webgroup temporarily established its own managed environment 

        to create and deploy content to coincide with the launch of the redesign. 

        On the infrastructure side, we implemented a three-tier staging environment 

        (see figure 2) and a custom-written application to &#145;push&#146; content 

        between tiers. This was a fairly high-level tool operating on directories 

        rather than individual files. On the business side, we established a strict 

        push schedule, which meant that content could only be moved into production 

        twice a week - although this could be fast-tracked for emergencies on 

        a case by case basis.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="honeysett.fig02.jpg" width="400" height="265"><br>

        Fig 2: Three-tier Staging Environment</p>

      <p>Initially there was great resistance from the programs to this regime. 

        The &#145;anarchic&#146; nature of content generation and deployment that 

        had established itself at the Getty meant that this was a considerable 

        culture shock. The programs perceived a &#145;loss of control&#146; of 

        their content, and objected to the delay between pushes. Fortunately, 

        the reality was different: the schedule of pushing every other day allowed 

        for only one day to create and review content before it went live. The 

        programs soon fell into the regime and altered their business processes 

        to accommodate the schedule. With the CMS implementation we could afford 

        to increase the push schedule to whatever was appropriate - since it would 

        be automatic. But the temporary situation was a good proving ground for 

        a professionally managed environment.</p>

      <h1>CMS Requirements</h1>

      <p>Armed with the detailed knowledge of content generation and processes 

        around the Getty gained during the redesign, the Web group drew up a requirements 

        document for a CMS. Our &#145;big ticket&#146; items are probably consistent 

        with many museums&#146; CMS wish list, and these were:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><span class="MsoBodyText">Template Driven: To guarantee consistent 

          visual design, to separate content from design and to allow multiple 

          content use.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="MsoBodyText">Used by HTML Illiterate: To allow an interface 

          that lets non-HTML contributors submit and review web content.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="MsoBodyText">Workflow: The processes established at 

          the Getty to get content to the Web site range from a simple two-step 

          workflow to complex multi-program, concurrent-task processes.</span></li>

        <li><span class="MsoBodyText"> File  Versioning: The ability to track 

          individual file changes, what and by whom.</span></li>

        <li><span class="MsoBodyText"> Rollback: The ability to publish an edition 

          of the Web site on any previous date. </span></li>

        <li><span class="MsoBodyText">Open/Standard Architecture: The Getty's 

          Web infrastructure is based on Unix servers, iPlanet Web servers, Java/perl 

          CGI applications and Oracle databases, all sitting on a Novell network. 

          Any Web application has to live in this environment.</span></li>

        <li><span class="MsoBodyText">Virtualisation: The ability to see any changes 

          or new content in the context of the entire Web site - before it is 

          deployed.</span></li>

        <li><span class="MsoBodyText"> Multiple Web site Management: For getty.edu 

          and for our Intranet GO (Getty Online).</span></li>

        <li> <span class="MsoBodyText">Cross-platform clients: The Getty has Mac 

          and PC-based contributors.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="MsoBodyText">Multi-channel Deployment: Eg.  XML and 

          WML delivery.</span></li>

        <li><span class="MsoBodyText">In-house Maintenance and Development: Not 

          to have to go back to the vendor.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="MsoBodyText">Vendor Stability: An important consideration 

          given the current economic times.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p>After tracking the CMS market during the re-design, the Web group focused 

        on three CMS products after the usual RFI (Request For Information) and 

        RFP (Request For Proposal) processes. These were: Stellent's Expedio (<a href="../http://www.stellent.com/" target="_blank">http://www.stellent.com</a>), 

        Vignette's StoryServer (<a href="../http://www.vignette.com/" target="_blank">http://www.vignette.com</a>) 

        and Interwoven's Teamsite (<a href="../http://www.interwoven.com/" target="_blank">http://www.interwoven.com</a>). 

        After a bake-off, the Getty selected Interwoven as its preferred CMS vendor.</p>

      <h1>Implementation</h1>

      <p>Teamsite is a Web-application suite based on C++, java, perl/cgi and 

        XML technologies. It is a client/server environment with all users interacting 

        with it via a browser. After some testing we established that Internet 

        Explorer was more compatible. The only exception to the browser interface 

        is the module to create workflows &#150; this is a Windows application. 

        Teamsite offers fully integrated <b>Templating</b>, a very flexible and 

        fully integrated <b>Workflow</b> engine, full <b>Virtualisation</b> and 

        integration with a broad range of Web content creation applications such 

        as <b>Dreamweaver</b> and <b>Homesite</b>. It also stands as a solid platform 

        on which to further develop our Web site, by integrating with an array 

        of <b>application</b>, <b>personalization</b> and <b>syndication</b> servers 

        &#150; which are long-term goals for the Web site.</p>

      <p>Interwoven's terms and conditions of sale include an agreed method of 

        installation and configuration. This means you need to buy their professional 

        services or contract with a registered Interwoven partner - a so- called 

        &#145;enabler&#146;, of which there are many and for which there is a 

        'corkage' fee to Interwoven. After reading a number of 'dot com' elegies, 

        we were keen not to have any one of these &#145;enablers&#146; come in, 

        install the product, then hold us to ransom over professional services 

        to develop our site. Also, our Web group has a strong technical component 

        and should be more than capable of maintaining the environment. The best 

        integration solution for us was Interwoven&#146;s so-called &#145;Fast 

        Forward Core Pack&#146; - a 30-day engagement with a Teamsite consultant 

        and project manager. At the end of this engagement, the client is &#145;guaranteed&#146; 

        to have a correctly installed and configured product, at least one site 

        deployed through Teamsite as a file-managed process, and up to two templates 

        and two workflows in place.</p>

      <p>We scheduled technical training to coincide with the arrival of the implementation 

        consultant so that we could speak the Teamsite language and could assist 

        in the installation and configuration. We installed the suite onto our 

        Unix <b>staging</b> server, since once operational, we eliminated the 

        need for a separate staging environment.</p>

      <h1>Environment</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Teamsite uses a server's native file structure to manage 

        and deploy content, and manages separate Web sites as <b>branches. </b>Because 

        of this approach, the default view of a Web site within Teamsite is as 

        a file system like Windows Explorer:</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="honeysett.fig03.jpg" width="400" height="301"><br>

        Fig 3: Teamsite's Default View of a Website</p>

      <p>Each registered user has an account based on the server's native authorization 

        technology. In our case this is LDAP. Within Teamsite, each user is assigned 

        at least one <b>workarea</b> and has a virtual view of the whole site. 

        This <b>workarea</b> corresponds to the section of the Web site on which 

        they work; they only have permission to modify documents within their 

        own <b>workarea</b>. Every user is also assigned a <b>role</b> depending 

        on contribution level. This determines the authority they have within 

        the environment: <b>author</b>, <b>editor</b>, <b>administrator</b> or 

        <b>master</b>:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Author &#150; the primary content creator: he owns content; can create 

          and edit files; can receive assignments through the workflow engine 

          and has work approved by his workarea owner.</li>

        <li>Editor &#150; creates content and oversees content creation: he owns 

          a workarea; can create, edit and delete files; approves or rejects work 

          of the authors; can submit files to the staging area and can publish 

          editions. </li>

        <li>Administrator &#150; manages an area or branch (Web site), of which 

          he is the owner and can create and delete workareas.</li>

        <li>Master &#150; has absolute power and fundamental administrative control 

          over the product - a role reserved for a Unix System Administrator and 

          a person to be chosen wisely.</li>

      </ul>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Working within the <b>workarea</b>, a user first synchronises 

        with the latest version of content by performing a <b>get latest</b> function 

        within the <b>staging area</b>. When the appropriate edits have been made 

        and checked within the virtualized view of the entire site, the content 

        is submitted back to the <b>staging area</b>. Browsing in the virtualized 

        view of the Web site is no different from browsing the site under normal 

        circumstances. The <b>staging area</b> is where all the content from different 

        <b>workareas</b> is integrated and tested. It is a read-only environment 

        where nothing can be edited. According to the publishing schedule, a snapshot 

        is made of the <b>staging area</b> creating an <b>edition</b>, which can 

        then be deployed to the production server.</p>

      <p>We were looking to manage two Web sites with Teamsite: getty.edu and 

        our Intranet, GO. After a week of analysis we began planning two development 

        environments, each of these becoming a branch within Teamsite. We then 

        'sucked in' each site &#150; a tar&#146;ing, FTP and untar&#146;ing process 

        &#150; which took about a day each. So, within two week' of the consultant's 

        arrival, we had set up a pre-production environment for both sites. With 

        these environments in place, we scheduled some intensive training on the 

        core Teamsite functions of Templating and Workflow &#150; unfortunately, 

        this required a lengthy field trip to Interwoven&#146;s training facilities 

        in San Francisco.</p>

      <h1>Templating</h1>

      <p>Templating is a core function of a CMS. It allows the separation of content 

        from design, the automatic generation of an HTML page from content, guarantees 

        consistent visual design, and allows Web pages to be generated by HTML-illiterate 

        contributors. A fully templated site is one significant goal of full implementation. 

        Teamsite&#146;s templating system is based on XML and requires a thorough 

        understanding to develop templates. We began by analyzing our Web site 

        to identify a list of initial template candidates. We started with the 

        broad assumption on the cost/benefit of converting pages under the homepage. 

        This indicated that the greatest cost/benefit was to be had at the lowest 

        levels, where many pages would be served with a single template. For example, 

        the museum collection subsite consists of approximately  18,000 pages,. 

        Analysis of the design and layout indicated that we could probably serve 

        this with fewer than five templates, possibly even one.</p>

      <p><b><br>

        Fig 5: Identifying Template Candidates </span></b></p>

      <p>We then applied a number of qualifications: Do a number of people contribute 

        content to this page? Does the content on this page change often? Additionally, 

        we wanted the first template candidates to also establish precedents for 

        resolving issues that would globally impact the site. We focused on two 

        candidates: the Job Postings, which have a lot of similar pages and a 

        daily turnover, and the News Articles, which have a weekly turnover but 

        a significant number of contributors (and consequently a complex associated 

        workflow).</p>

      <h1>Templating Process</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Templating is a three-step process of data capture, 

        storage and presentation, figure 6 shows a schematic of this process.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="honeysett.fig06.jpg" width="400" height="271"><br>

        Fig 6: Templating Overview</p>

      <p>When a user wants to submit content using a template, they first fill 

        out a <b>data capture template</b> (<b>DCT</b>). This is in an XML configuration 

        file, created by a developer with a good understanding of XML and some 

        basic programming skills. Submitting a completed <b>DCT</b> saves a <b>data 

        content record</b> (<b>DCR</b>) which is either saved as a file or to 

        a database. The last element is a <b>presentation template</b> (<b>PT</b>), 

        another XML file with a variety of markup flavors: ASP, JSP, WML or HTML 

        and also embedded <b>perl</b> callouts and conditional programming tags. 

        The <b>PT</b> is essentially created from an existing HTML page by giving 

        it an XML &#145;wrapper&#146; and substituting the content areas with 

        appropriate XML tags that are defined in the <b>DCR</b>. Figure 7 shows 

        code fragments tracing a single piece of content, a job title, from capture 

        to presentation:</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="honeysett.fig07.jpg" width="400" height="146"><br>

        Fig 7: Tracing a single piece of content </p>

      <p>When the presentation engine combines the <b>DCR</b> and the <b>PT</b> 

        it executes any perl and any conditional tags to generate the final page. 

        The jurisdiction of the different roles in the templating process can 

        be summarized as:</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="honeysett.fig08.jpg" width="400" height="322"><br>

        Fig 8: The Jurisdiction of Roles in the Templating Process</p>

      <p>The templating architecture makes for a very powerful and flexible process 

        and allows for single presentation templates to account for a wide range 

        of related Web pages. Much of the template process can be automated; for 

        example, workflows can be invoked at the <b>DCR</b> commit stage, or the 

        final Web page can be generated automatically when a <b>DCR</b> is saved. 

        It is wise not to underestimate the amount of work required to convert 

        a Web site into templates.</p>

      <h1>Workflow</h1>

      <p>Workflow is another core function of a CMS - it defines the content creation 

        and approval processes. The workflow module in Teamsite was one of the 

        most comprehensive and flexible we reviewed during the selection process. 

        The biggest challenge we found in implementing workflows within the Getty 

        is the analysis of the 'business' processes, which continues to be a challenge. 

        This analysis is a time-consuming practice in an environment where these 

        processes have grown organically over time. When interviewing staff around 

        the Getty, we often found ourselves giving advice on consolidating their 

        processes, since no one had thought to review what was happening. Often 

        when we flowcharted the program's processes, staff were surprised at how 

        redundant their activities were. The concise steps to analyzing a process 

        that we use are:</p>

      <p class=listwithnumbers> 1. State the general requirement for the process</p>

      <p class=listwithnumbers> 2. Identify the tasks that need to be performed</p>

      <p class=listwithnumbers> 3. Identify who needs to perform the tasks</p>

      <p class=listwithnumbers> 4. Order the tasks in which they need to be performed</p>

      <p class=listwithnumbers> 5. Review with the process requirement</p>

      <p>Having generated and signed off a flow chart representing the workflow 

        process, the next step is to implement the workflow. <b>WorkflowBuilder</b> 

        is a drag-and-drop flowcharting application based heavily on the <b>Visio</b> 

        interface. </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="honeysett.fig09.jpg" width="400" height="276"><br>

        Fig 9: An Example Workflow in WorkflowBuilder</p>

      <p>Figure 9 shows a typical workflow of six <b>tasks</b>. When invoked within 

        Teamsite, the instance of this workflow is termed a <b>job</b>. It has 

        a variety of variables associated with it, which are defined when the 

        <b>job</b> starts. For example, one variable might be the name of a file 

        that needs updating or the name of a directory where a new page needs 

        to be created. The first task in figure 9 is a content-creation task which 

        will be assigned to a user using the <b>owner</b> variable. When the content 

        has been written and submitted, the workflow sends an e-mail to the appropriate 

        <b>approver</b> with review instructions and a hyperlink to the relevant 

        content. A rejection generates an e-mail back to the <b>owner</b>, but 

        an approval submits the content which might invoke the automatic generation 

        of a Web page ready for deployment. This workflow is very generic. The 

        use of variables allows for many instances of a single workflow &#150; 

        the variables simply travel along with a particular workflow instance. 

        The power of the workflow engine can be extended immensely by additional 

        tasks such as the <b>CGI</b> script invocation and an <b>external</b> 

        task which runs any external application or script on the host machine.</p>

      <h1>Deployment</h1>

      <p>Deployment of content is the final step in the content generation process. 

        It is the sending and receiving of files from the base server to the receiver 

        host. Any number of deployment scenarios can be created, based on three 

        basic themes: Deploy files in a specified list - the list can be generated 

        programmatically; Deploy files in a directory by file comparison between 

        the source and the target;  Deploy directories by directory comparison 

        between the source and the target. The file transfer executes in a transactional 

        mode, meaning that content will not be replaced on the production server 

        until all the requested files have been received. </p>

      <h1>The Rollout</h1>

      <p>One important factor in selecting this product was its ability to manage 

        a Web site at a file level. This allowed us to implement Teamsite without 

        disturbing the contributors around the Getty using their Dreamweaver and 

        Homesite applications. We simply continued to import their files from 

        the development server into Teamsite until we were ready to schedule their 

        training and register them as users. The go-live date was an uneventful 

        day. One day we were 'pushing,' and the next day we were 'deploying'.&#150;  

        This fact alone makes it a resounding success. The process of trawling 

        through the Website leaving templated content in our wake is ongoing, 

        to be completed around June 2002.</p>

      <h1>Future Initiatives</h1>

      <p>We selected Teamsite with a long-term web strategy in mind. We chose 

        this particular product because we require a platform that will foster 

        the best opportunities to meet our long term goals and also one that is 

        flexible enough to integrate with presently unknown program initiatives 

        and future www trends. There are two immediate initiatives that are of 

        note:</p>

      <p><b>Vocabulary-Assisted Metatagging</b> &#150; There is a significant 

        metadata initiative at the Getty and extensive research into vocabulary-assisted 

        searching. Currently, searching on getty.edu results in an 'invisible' 

        expansion against our <b>ULAN</b> (United List of Artist Names) vocabulary. 

        By way of an example, if one searches for Carrucci on our Web site, 15 

        hits are returned to Pontormo but no mention of Carrucci &#150; because 

        Carrucci was the birth name of Pontormo as defined in ULAN. While we will 

        continue to expand search queries against our vocabularies (<b>Art &amp; 

        Architecture Thesaurus</b> and the <b>Thesaurus of Geographic Names</b> 

        are planned shortly), we plan to integrate more fully the metatagging 

        of content at the creation stage. As luck would have it, Teamsite has 

        a module called <b>Metatagger</b>, which we have already begun to investigate.</p>

      <p><b>Personalisation &#150; </b>The 'next big thing' for our Web site is 

        a venture into the world of Personalization. Again, as luck would have 

        it, Interwoven is partnered with a variety of personalization server providers. 

        At the time of writing, we are in the selection process, so stay tuned.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p>Teamsite is an expensive solution to enterprise-wide content management 

        that the Getty is in the fortunate position to be able to afford. Moreover, 

        our Web strategy is such that we require an &#145;industrial grade&#146; 

        CMS such as this to achieve our goals. The implementation involved a significant 

        amount of planning, strategizing and work plus a high level of technical 

        skill and support. The ongoing maintenance and development of the site 

        through Teamsite has greatly increased the skill level of the Web group 

        and shifted the typical requirements of a &#145;manually&#146; maintained 

        Website. In some areas it has polarized the webgroup resources, requiring 

        more technical people to work on the &#145;back end&#146; but fewer technical 

        and fewer Web-literate people on the &#145;front end&#146;. The executive-level 

        expectation of a CMS is often a reduction in resources required for Web 

        site development. To a certain extent this is true; however, those reduced 

        resources are at a higher technical level that may offset any perceived 

        budgetary reductions. For us, the webgroup is just as busy after the implementation. 

        The difference is that we&#146;re accomplishing more.</p>
