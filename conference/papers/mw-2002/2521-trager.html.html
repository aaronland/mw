      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>In January of 2001, Bellevue Art Museum opened its doors in a newly constructed 

        facility.  The Museum moved into a space three times as big as the old 

        one, with three times as much programming.  Learning to operate in a new, 

        bigger space was a challenge for all the Museum workers, including staff 

        and volunteers.</p>

      <p>The docents had been keeping their schedules in a binder at the Museum, 

        with their tour duties written in.  If they wanted to check their schedule 

        to see if a tour had been assigned to them during one of their shifts, 

        they had to physically travel to the Museum.  If they needed to switch 

        shifts with another docent, they needed to visit the Museum to make that 

        change.  A system that worked in the smaller space, with fewer tours and 

        fewer staff, began to break down in the new building.  The docents began 

        experiencing attendance problems due to scheduling confusion and a general 

        lack of enthusiasm.</p>

      <p>The Docent President approached me in May 2001.  She said that the docents 

        wanted to put their schedule on-line.  They didn&#146;t know what to do 

        or how to do it, but they recognized that &#147;penciling it in&#148; 

        wasn&#146;t working for them anymore.  In our first meeting, she told 

        me that the docents wanted to be able to access, sort and change their 

        schedules from outside the museum, so they wouldn&#146;t have to drive 

        in to see whether or not they needed to be there.  They also wanted to 

        improve their communication, and put the documents governing their group 

        and guiding their activities on-line.  They wanted to be able to send 

        their meeting minutes out electronically, and to access their research 

        materials over the Internet.  But the ultimate goal was to eliminate the 

        binder system.</p>

      <p>They knew from their roster that out of 115 active docents only about 

        10 did not have email.  The assumption was that 91% of the docents would 

        be perfectly comfortable operating with an online scheduling system and 

        would be able to access it from their homes.  The rest could use the computers 

        in the Museum&#146;s library, which were already designated for the docents&#146; 

        use.</p>

      <p>The docents&#146; commitment to the idea was clear, and I recognized 

        the value of what they wanted to accomplish.  I agreed to do the project, 

        but not without some reservations.  I was concerned that the docents would 

        resist using a non-binder system, despite assurances from docent leaders 

        that they were all looking forward to getting their schedules online.  

        I feared that if we built something without fully understanding the true 

        needs of the docents that it would be useless and therefore unused.  I 

        was also rather busy with the usual demands of my job, and knew I would 

        have to budget my time carefully.</p>

      <p>So along with my commitment to the project, I had some caveats.  They 

        were as follows:</p>

      <ol class="normal">

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">We needed to document our plan 

          very carefully and even more thoroughly.  The inherent challenge in 

          the project was working with the docents, a highly committed group but 

          also one with very little technical experience.  I quickly recognized 

          that the docents were not able to understand and get a mental image 

          of processes that I would describe dismissively, saying &#147;Oh, yeah, 

          we&#146;ll just set up an Access backend with an asp front end.&#148;  

          The plan needed to include page-by-page descriptions of purpose and 

          functionality, and a chart demonstrating the logic behind the navigation 

          of the site.<br>

          <br>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">I didn&#146;t have the time to 

          do all the work myself.  I required active participation on the part 

          of the Docent President, and preferably the entire docent council, to 

          gather the content for the extranet and present it to me in a usable 

          format.  Additionally, I wanted to get help from the Museum&#146;s web-developer, 

          who offered to do a great deal of the work for a minimal flat fee.  

          Part of the overall project plan was a careful documentation of who 

          the participants were and what they would each do.<br>

          <br>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">I wanted to ensure that the extranet 

          would be a success.  The first measure of success would be if the docents 

          used it.  We purposely decided not to approach the project with an &#147;if 

          we build it, they will come&#148; attitude.  The docent president and 

          I worked together to plan out how we would make the extranet as usable 

          as possible, and then present the docents with the extranet.  We planned 

          to not just train them and orient them to use it, but veritably indoctrinate 

          them with a new business paradigm.  We also worked out a strategy for 

          evaluating the project over time.<br>

          <br>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The extranet had to be sustainable 

          in the future.  The current president was very committed and was willing 

          to do whatever she could to get the extranet implemented, but the docent 

          council changes yearly, and what if the next president couldn&#146;t 

          or wouldn&#146;t keep it going?  What if the staff didn&#146;t become 

          engaged, and resisted contributing content and administrative support 

          for the extranet?  We had to look past implementation to determine whether 

          the processes we were putting in place would be sustainable by both 

          staff and docents.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <h1>Technical Specifications</h1>

      <p>The technology of this project hasn&#146;t broken any new ground - in 

        fact the platform we used is somewhat mundane.  This was a deliberate 

        choice.  We wanted the extranet to be simple to administer, as it would 

        be simple to use.  The real novelty of this project was working with a 

        group of self-governing volunteers who usually manage themselves almost 

        completely independently from the Museum administration, and who are statistically 

        in an age group that tends to have limited computer experience.</p>

      <p>The scope of the project was simple.  We decided to build a website with 

        about 25 pages, using FrontPage2000 as the web editor.  The front end 

        would be done in asp, with an Access 2000 database to store the schedule 

        and roster information.  The web site would be hosted on the Museum site, 

        <a href="../http://www.bellevueart.org/" target="_blank">http://www.bellevueart.org</a>, 

        in a password-protected folder to protect the docents&#146; personal information 

        and ensure that only the docents or staff with access would be able to 

        make changes to the schedule.  The docents would be able to make limited 

        changes to the schedule by logging on to the extranet, but the administrative 

        portion would be located in a different location that the staff could 

        access to update the rosters and add scheduled tours.  The entire extranet 

        would not exceed 3 megabytes of hard disk space, and the entire project 

        would cost $500.</p>

      <p>This is the original chart of the site that shows it as-built.  The site 

        has changed somewhat, and later on in this paper a new chart will be available 

        demonstrating those changes.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Fig. 1:  Organizational Chart of the Bellevue Art Museum 

        Docent Extranet</p>

      <h1>Project Participants</h1>

      <p>The following roles and responsibilities were documented thoroughly in 

        the project plan.  Common practice at museums with volunteer personnel 

        is to provide a staff person to be a conduit between the volunteer group 

        and other staff, and Bellevue Art Museum is no exception.  Originally, 

        we intended to observe that tradition and work with the designated liaison 

        from the education department, but in recognition of the unusual nature 

        of the project, we quickly eliminated the middleman and worked directly 

        with the docents.</p>

      <p>The 2001 Docent President, Nancy Rignel, was a pivotal member of the 

        project team.  As the manager of the docent program, she consulted with 

        me on every aspect of planning and managing the extranet project, and 

        took on the responsibility of content delivery and coordinating training 

        for the docents to learn how to use the extranet&#146;s functionality.  

        She also accepted responsibility for providing mentoring for the docents 

        who required special attention and remedial training in general computer 

        use, and led several of the standard trainings.</p>

      <p>As Bellevue Art Museum Information Systems Manager, I took on overall 

        project management, with a commitment to future administration of the 

        extranet.  The largest part of my responsibility was to put together the 

        project plan, including goals, objectives, and functional requirements.  

        I designed the navigation of the site and built the asp pages and the 

        database.  I consulted with the web developer on design, layout and functionality.  

        I also planned the training strategy for the docents, led most of the 

        general trainings, and assisted with special trainings as necessary.</p>

      <p>The Museum&#146;s web developer, Scott March, implemented the web site.  

        He set up a secure section of the Bellevue Art Museum web site, added 

        a docent user account with access to secure section, and prepared all 

        design elements.  Scott also provided his programming expertise, mostly 

        for asp scripts and database routines.  He hooked up the asp pages I provided 

        for him to the Access 2000 database, adding and modifying asp pages as 

        necessary.  Scott provided the functionality of the site by setting up 

        the routines and forms for docents to query and update the schedule.  

        He also designed a secure administrative interface for staff to use in 

        updating roster and tour information.</p>

      <p>Other project participants included the Education Coordinator, who helped 

        specify the business requirements of the database, and members of the 

        docent council, who provided content for the site.</p>

      <h1>User Interface and Design</h1>

      <p>Our intention for the user interface and design elements of the site 

        was to keep it simple.  We felt that if the site were easy to use, the 

        docents would be that much more likely to use it.  We wanted the site 

        to carry the Museum&#146;s identity, but we placed much more importance 

        on functionality than aesthetics.  We had a captive audience who would 

        only be irritated by unnecessary graphical elements or flashy design. 

        Even so, the docents are a visually sophisticated group, and the agreement 

        was that the design would be clean and uncluttered, yet had to live up 

        to the standards set by the Museum&#146;s public website.</p>

      <p>Additionally, we wanted the site to be easy to maintain.  We developed 

        style sheets containing default formatting information and a header and 

        footer containing the main navigational elements so every page look consistent 

        to the user, and building new or editing existing pages would be easily 

        accomplished.</p>

      <p>The homepage of the website includes navigational elements and the Museum 

        logo.</p>

      </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Fig. 2:  Bellevue Art Museum Docent Extranet: Main Page</p>

      <p>The schedule page allows the docents to search their schedules by date, 

        docent name, exhibit and type.  Type includes gallery duty, school tour 

        or specially scheduled tour.</p>

      </p>

      <p>Searching brings up an asp page created on the fly, sorting the tours 

        in order of date and time.</p>

      </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Fig. 4:  Bellevue Art Museum Docent Extranet:  Schedule</p>

      <p>If the docent needs to swap tours with another docent, they simply click 

        on any tour record element to bring up the change form.</p>

      <p>The research page provides links to research materials developed by the 

        curatorial staff and docents, designed to prepare docents to give tours.</p>

      <p>The Docent Info page provides links to the docent roster, meeting minutes, 

        a calendar listing, Exhibition Guidelines, the By-laws of their organization 

        and the Museum&#146;s learning plan.</p>

      <p>The Provisional Info page has links to information for docents-in-training, 

        including their calendar, their mentor roster, and training materials.</p>

      <p>Museum Info includes a staff roster, as well as the Museum&#146;s customer 

        service policy, the emergency plan, and computer use policy.</p>

      <p>The links page is simply a listing of hyperlinks to the websites of other 

        museum in the Seattle area and contemporary visual arts organizations 

        around the country.</p>

      <p>Naturally, there have been changes in the original plan for user interface 

        and design.  Even during the implementation process there were changes 

        to the overall schema, as we found better solutions through tinkering 

        than we could have through planning.  </p>

      <p>Some of the changes are a result of having our most basic assumptions 

        challenged, yet have significant ramifications.  For example, the original 

        plan assumed that pages with static documentation would be built in html 

        (don&#146;t be fooled by the .asp extensions).  This was not explicitly 

        stated, however, and we found that it was preferable to build a menu page 

        for each section in html, but to publish the research information and 

        other documents as PDFs.  The benefits of the PDFs compared to pages done 

        in html are: they&#146;re easier for us to publish to the site, and the 

        docents can print them out with a better result.  Some of the docent&#146;s 

        &#147;old eyes&#148; are actually made uncomfortable by reading from a 

        computer screen, so publishing PDFs is a matter of not just convenience, 

        but access as well.</p>

      <p>This chart demonstrates the changes in the extranet, with additions highlighted 

        in yellow.</p>

      <h1>Training Methods</h1>

      <p>The training portion of the project included several elements:</p>

      <ol start=1 type=1>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The extranet was demonstrated 

          to the entire docent body at their monthly meeting in September 2001.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <ol start=2 type=1>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">In order to give them hands-on 

          experience, we scheduled performance-based trainings in the Museum library, 

          which houses three computers with Internet access.  By doubling up the 

          docents 2 to a computer, we were able to accommodate 6 docents per training, 

          with a total of 66 docents participating in 11 trainings.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <ol start=3 type=1>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Special trainings are continually 

          made available for docents who feel they need more remedial help or 

          training in general computer use. </span></li>

      </ol>

      <ol start=4 type=1>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A standard email was sent to docents 

          containing the extranet&#146;s URL, username and password, and brief 

          instructions in its use.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <ol start=5 type=1>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A business card printed with the 

          extranet&#146;s URL, username and password, and brief instructions in 

          accessing it from home, was distributed to all the docents.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <ol start=6 type=1>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Periodic emails and demonstrations 

          on subjects such as how to download, install, and use Adobe Acrobat 

          Reader, are planned throughout the year.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <h1>Evaluation</h1>

      <p>Other than the list server portion of this project, we believe the original 

        goals and objectives of the project have been met.  Our primary goal, 

        to create efficiencies for the Docent program using information and web 

        technology, appears to have been met.  By its very existence, the extranet 

        has drastically reduced the amount of time and money spent on mailings 

        as well as travel time for the docents.</p>

      <p>The measure for success is not just how many docents use it, but also 

        which parts they&#146;re using most.  If we were successful in our goals, 

        then the functions of the extranet representing efficiency over the old 

        business system should get the most use; specifically, Schedule, Research 

        and Minutes.  The following chart represents the percentage of docents 

        actually utilizing each function of the extranet:</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>      <img src="tragerFigure07.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="Percentage of docents using each function">                

        <br>

        Fig. 7:  Percentage of docents using each function</p>

      <p>Our second goal was to electronically augment docent communication with 

        each other and with BAM staff.  Posting documentation such as the Docent 

        Bylaws and Exhibition Guidelines, as well as the Museum&#146;s policies 

        on customer service, emergency procedure and computer use have enabled 

        all staff and docents to work from the same informed perspective.  The 

        addition of the docent and staff rosters on the site with names, phone 

        numbers, and live email address links have promoted an ease of communication 

        previously impossible.</p>

      <p>Observations of the docents (and staff) as they work are constantly re-assessed 

        and re-interpreted to help determine our status on the docent extranet 

        project, but the primary method of evaluating the overall success has 

        been to survey the docents.  88% of the respondents to a January 2002 

        survey said they have used the extranet.  We also asked the docents to 

        evaluate the training they received, and the level of difficulty in logging 

        on to the extranet and learning to use it.  65% said they were satisfied 

        with the training they received.  75% said they felt the logon procedure 

        is simple, and 63% said they felt the extranet is simple to use.</p>

      <h1>Future Plans</h1>

      <p>For the next 6 months we will continue to evaluate the level of usage, 

        as well as the general computer skill level of the docents.  According 

        to the January 2002 survey, the average docent user has 8 years of experience 

        with personal computers, 98% have computers in their homes, and 93% have 

        email.  The numbers, though, can be misleading.  They do not represent 

        depth of experience.  For example, we have discovered that while the docents 

        may be experienced in sending an email, many may not know how to send 

        an attachment.  At this time the level of computer skill among the docents 

        fluctuates from complete novice to expert.  Future surveys will evaluate 

        the depth of skill amongst the docents, and future training will be geared 

        to bring all the docents to a higher average expertise.  The docents have 

        expressed an interest in taking over some of the administration of the 

        site, such as scanning the images for the research portion, as well as 

        training and mentoring each other as new docents learn to use the system.  

        As the docents&#146; average skill level increases, they will be able 

        to take a more active role in these activities.  As the docents&#146; 

        skills grow, we will plan to add more functionality to the site appropriate 

        to the sophisticated level of user that they will someday become.</p>
