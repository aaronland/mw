      <h2 align=center class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h2>

      <p class="AbstractText">Large national museums can afford to create their 

        own on-line mass communication services and to undertake e-commerce activities 

        themselves. However, for other museums, this can be a daunting prospect, 

        both technically and financially. It is also likely to be much less effective. 

        A solution could be to create an on-line museum community of small to 

        medium sized museums who alone would struggle to make such an enterprise 

        a success but who together, with suitable help, could rival the efforts 

        of national museums. This mini-workshop examines existing example of museum 

        e-commerce and facilities that could be used by museums. It then goes 

        on to propose a possible infrastructure for museums wishing to take their 

        initial steps in e-commerce at low cost and low risk.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>We think of the Internet and e-commerce as being a 

        new phenomenon but actually the idea of virtual trading has been around 

        for a long time as the following demonstrates (Branson, 2000):</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote"><i>&#147;&#133; the late 19th century had its own 

        Victorian Internet </i>(Standage, 1999)<i>, and the first transatlantic 

        cable was not a product of the 1980s but rather the 1880s. Over a hundred 

        years ago <a href="../http://www.harrods.com/" target="_blank">Harrods</a> 

        advertised its telegraphic address, and received orders and goods and 

        services from all over the world, even to the extent that it had as much 

        virtual trade as a percentage of its sales in 1899 as it does today.&#148;<br>

        <br>

        </i><span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">-- Richard Branson (speaking in Oxford, 

        1999)</span></p>

      <p class=normal>However the term &#147;e-commerce&#148; has only become 

        a buzzword much more recently. One of the earliest examples of modern 

        e-commerce is that of the <a href="../http://www.peapod.com/" target="_blank">Peapod</a> 

        grocery service founded in Chicago in 1989 using a dial-up service via 

        modems (Wohl &amp; Poole, 2001).</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Initially the <a href="../http://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">World 

        Wide Web</a> was developed as a global information transfer system in 

        the academic world of physicists using the <a href="../http://www.cern.ch/" target="_blank">CERN</a> 

        facility in Switzerland. However, a very important turning point of the 

        web was the deliberate decision by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the 

        World Wide Web, to make the technology and standards freely available 

        not only for non-profit making activities but also for commercial ventures 

        as well (Berners-Lee, 2000). Fortunately CERN did not object since they 

        were interested in physics rather than computing. Without the decision, 

        the web may never have emerged as the dominant force that it is on the 

        Internet today, with its great potential for e-commerce, an area for which 

        it was not originally designed. For example, a competing technology called 

        <a href="../http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Internet/Gopher/" target="_blank">Gopher</a>, 

        that was widely adopted in academia in the early 1990s, lost out subsequently 

        to the web at least partially because the university where it was developed 

        thought that it could be commercialized. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>One of the earliest web-based e-commerce services was 

        the sale of pizzas by Pizza Hut in Santa Cruz, California, in 1994. This 

        was internationally known in web circles at the time, but was unsuccessful 

        because there were not enough potential customers then, even in California. 

        Ordering from the UK, for instance, was not really an option even though 

        the website was viewable!</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Among the early museum adopters of e-commerce was the 

        Metropolitan Museum in New York that had and still has the resources to 

        set up its own on-line shopping facilities with no recourse to any other 

        similar organizations. Large museums certainly have this option, but for 

        smaller museums, without the technical expertise or the finance to pay 

        for this option, it is much more difficult to establish an e-commerce 

        presence, and is probably not cost effective on their own in any case.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Like other market sectors, museums have been using 

        the Internet and specifically the World Wide Web to further their mission 

        of information dissemination to the public since the mid 1990s (Bowen 

        1995). Although many museums have an on-line presence and are increasingly 

        using electronic mail and other Internet facilities, the nature of the 

        sector means that there is a great variety in Internet usage. Some early 

        adopters had web sites in the early 1990s, but others, especially those 

        in less well-developed countries, have yet to establish a web presence.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The largest and most prestigious institutions are on 

        a par with commercial corporations and may have an Intranet, on-line access 

        to their collections using database technology and even e-commerce facilities 

        to allow on-line purchase of items in their museum shop. However this 

        represents a very small proportion of the sector at present. From these 

        large enterprises, museums range down to very small organizations, perhaps 

        run on a volunteer basis, and sometimes with no full-time employees. Between 

        these two extremes lie the vast majority of museums. These &#147;Small 

        to Medium sized Museums&#148; (SMMs) are the ones that could most benefit 

        from improved support for on-line activities, perhaps in a collaborative 

        and symbiotic manner. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>This paper examines the current use by museums of the 

        World Wide Web for e-commerce activities. It then goes on to suggest ways 

        in which combining together into a community of museums could benefit 

        both individual museums and the museum section as a whole in commercial 

        activities on-line.</p>

      <h1>The Existing Market </h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>In the UK, as an example, there are around 1,500 museums 

        and around the world there are a hundred thousand museums or more (depending 

        on one&#146;s definition of a museum). Only a relatively small proportion 

        have their own website even now. The percentage depends on the country, 

        with the US not surprisingly leading the way. However, the UK is perhaps 

        around a year behind developments in the USA and the Virtual Library museums 

        pages (VLmp) on-line directory of museums [<a href="../http://www.icom.org/vlmp" target="_blank">www.icom.org/vlmp</a>] 

        lists several hundred museums with websites in the UK.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The leading national museums have significant websites 

        on their own web servers, with their own Webmaster to maintain the site. 

        However, even for these museums, e-commerce and on-line databases are 

        still a relative novelty and are by no means universally available. A 

        recent guide on the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) 

        issues to independent museums in the UK (Gander and Melling, 2002) covers 

        basic issues of planning and maintaining a website, and even accessibility 

        concerns (Getchell and Rubin, 2002), as well as the use of email, but 

        makes no mention of more advanced issues like the incorporation of e-commerce 

        facilities.</p>

        UK museums:<br>

        Information collected by the UK </i></span><span class="MsoCaption"><i>Association 

        of Independent Museums</i></span></p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Figure 1 gives a sample of 19 independent UK museums 

        showing their shop sales for two months (in and out of season) and for 

        a half-year period from information collected by the UK Association of 

        Independent Museums (AIM) [<a href="../http://www.museums.org.uk/aim" target="_blank">www.museums.org.uk/aim</a>]. 

        In the summer season, sales are around three times winter sales. On-line 

        the difference may not be so marked.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Currently none of these museums have on-line sales 

        so the market is wide open for development. A reasonable target in the 

        long-term would be for on-line sales to equal on-site museum sales, especially 

        if the museums worked together in marketing their on-line e-commerce facilities. 

        The model has been implemented successfully for the on-line family history 

        fair and genealogy bookstore website GENfair [<a href="../http://www.genfair.com/" target="_blank">www.genfair.com</a>]. 

        This was launched in January 1999; by October 2000, it already had over 

        ten thousand purchasable items from 52 UK Family History Societies and 

        35 related organizations on its website.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>There is currently no on-line marketplace specifically 

        for museum B2B (business to business) transactions. Even the US has not 

        developed this area for the museums sector yet. Indeed, there are still 

        research issues to be addressed in B2B e-commerce provision; e.g., see 

        Fensel <i>et al</i>. (2001).</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Yahoo provide a general B2B website [<a

href="../http://b2b.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">b2b.yahoo.com</a>] and a search for 

        &#147;museum&#148; reveals seven product headings (in February 2002), 

        although these seem to overlap somewhat. The categorized products break 

        down to include cases, displays, equipment, supplies, furniture and gifts. 

        However, there are not yet many companies listed under some of the product 

        headings, but there are 73 under &#147;Equipment &amp; Supplies&#148;, 

        66 under &#147;Cases: Museum Display&#148;, 91 under &#147;Exhibits: Museum&#148; 

        and 22 under &#147;Furniture: Museum&#148;. However, many of the companies 

        listed do not have a website or email address included in their entry! 

        Despite the current shortcomings, given the reputation of Yahoo, this 

        site could development significantly in the future.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>In the UK, the Museums Association [<a

href="../http://www.museumsassociation.org/" target="_blank">www.museumsassociation.org</a>] 

        include a list of museum suppliers, who have become corporate members 

        of the Museums Association, on their website. This is searchable by company 

        name, category and keyword. The resource has the potential to be developed 

        into a B2B e-commerce website in the future.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Some companies are aiming to aid website creation for 

        particular vertical markets. For example, Biblion [<a

href="../http://www.biblion.com/" target="_blank">www.biblion.com</a>] describes 

        itself as a bookshop of bookshops; it allows antiquarian book dealers 

        to create and maintain their own website using a web-based interface, 

        with a selection of standard templates for different design styles. A 

        full domain name is available as part of the service, which is provided 

        at a cost of around $45 per month. A similar model could be used in the 

        museum sector.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Other Internet start-ups are aiming at related vertical 

        market sectors such as schools for B2B activities. See, for example, the 

        UK school oriented commercial website called <i>Schools for Schools</i> 

        [<a

href="../http://www.schoolsforschools.com/" target="_blank">www.schoolsforschools.com</a>] 

        which is planning such facilities for suppliers of goods for schools.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>There has been significant activity in the US creating 

        companies to help with museum networking and e-commerce (Bowen, 2000b). 

        In particular, MuseumNetwork.com and MuseumShop.com are two companies 

        with aims in this area. <a href="../http://www.museumnetwork.com/" target="_blank">MuseumNetwork.com</a> 

        has offices in the USA and also in the UK. A website has been established, 

        although this is undergoing redevelopment, and a significant amount of 

        venture capital has been used to establish the company. They have interests 

        in being a museum portal, e-commerce and educational support.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText><a href="../http://www.museumshop.com/" target="_blank">MuseumShop.com</a> 

        has partnered mainly with larger museums, although there are still less 

        than a hundred museums involved [<a href="../http://www.museumshop.com/" target="_blank">www.museumshop.com</a>]. 

        Most are in the US, the company having being started in the USA, although 

        the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and a 

        number of other European museums have been added more recently. The cost 

        and commitment of partnering with Museumshop.com is such that it may deter 

        smaller museums from joining. They have their own fulfillment center in 

        the US and are expanding in Europe. Users can register with the website 

        and receive regular electronic mail shots. The website includes 64 museum 

        partners (in February 2002) mainly from the US but with an increasing 

        number from Europe. The site is browsable in a variety of ways, including 

        by museum, artist and period, and in the themes of art, science, maritime, 

        children and historical. In addition, browsing by item type such as jewelry, 

        home &amp; garden, sculpture, prints &amp; posters, books, entertainment, 

        stationery, clothing &amp; accessories, and toys &amp; games. Information 

        on the partner museums and external hyperlinks to them are also available.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>In Europe itself there is still little centralized 

        commercial on-line museum support although the US on-line museum companies 

        have their eye on this market and are starting to expand outside the US. 

        One European effort, <a href="../http://www.museum.com/" target="_blank">Museum.com</a> 

        is based in Germany and aims to act as a portal particularly suitable 

        for access by <a

href="../http://www.wapforum.org/" target="_blank">WAP</a> (Wireless Application 

        Protocol) enabled mobile phones. Currently there is no direct competition 

        based in the UK itself, even though there is a thriving museum community. 

        MuseumNet does provide a commercial UK museum portal [<a href="../http://www.museums.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.museums.co.uk</a>].</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>At the 2001 UK Museums Association conference in London 

        (Bowen, 2001b), a specialist workshop on <i>E-commerce, Mail Order and 

        the Museum Shop</i> was organized by Retail Matters [<a

href="../http://www.retailmatters.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.retailmatters.co.uk</a>], 

        who concentrate on retailing for historic houses, museums, gardens and 

        cathedrals in the UK. The first presentation focused on the mail order 

        operation associated with the Science Museum in London, although there 

        is an associated website [<a href="../http://www.sciencemuseumstore.com/" target="_blank">www.sciencemuseumstore.com</a>]. 

        The second presentation gave an overview of the first steps in e-commerce 

        by the St. Paul&#146;s Cathedral shop [<a href="../http://www.stpaulsshop.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.stpaulsshop.co.uk</a>]. 

        This has started out on a small scale with orders being sent to and fulfilled 

        by the shop itself. Interestingly, the vast majority of customers are 

        from North America and many order the guidebook for perusal before their 

        visit.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The Metropolitan Museum in New York was one of the 

        first museums in the world to provide its own on-line sophisticated shopping 

        facilities to its virtual visitors [<a href="../http://www.metmuseum.org/store/" target="_blank">www.metmuseum.org/store</a>]. 

        They allow users to register free and send periodic electronic mail shots 

        that are not too obtrusive. This museum is large enough to undertake sophisicated 

        web developments completely independently of any other museum.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston has an on-line shop 

        including books, exhibition gifts, fashion items, goods for the home, 

        jewelry, items for children, notes, calendars, prints, etc. [<a

href="../http://www.mfa.org/shop/" target="_blank">www.mfa.org/shop</a>]. It also 

        includes a separately presented on-line outlet store offering substantial 

        discounts on some items [<a href="../http://store.yahoo.com/mfaoutlet/" target="_blank">store.yahoo.com/mfaoutlet</a>]. 

        Both of these use on-line store facilities provided by Yahoo.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The Museum Company runs a chain of physical shops selling 

        museum-related items as well as having a website with the usual virtual 

        shopping bag facilities [<a href="../http://www.museumcompany.com/" target="_blank">www.museumcompany.com</a>]. 

        The website explicitly targets corporate sales (e.g., aimed at rewards 

        for staff, presents for business partners, etc.), as well as more standard 

        retail sales to the public. The Museum Company is a partner with Yahoo, 

        presenting a number of museums and related items for sale on-line [<a

href="../http://store.yahoo.com/museumcompany/" target="_blank">store.yahoo.com/museumcompany</a>].</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>For a directory of existing museums around the world 

        that provide on-line shopping facilities, see the Musee.com museum stores 

        on-line website [<a href="../http://www.musee.com/" target="_blank">www.musee.com</a>].</p>

      <h1>Related Organizations </h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>To undertake e-commerce effectively, it is (or would 

        be) necessary for most museums, apart from the very largest ones, to partner 

        and cooperate with other organizations to make a success of the enterprise. 

        Here we suggest a number of example organizations and companies that could 

        be helpful in establishing an e-commerce presence for museums.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>In the United Kingdom, the 24 Hour Museum [<a

href="../http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.24hourmuseum.org.uk</a>] 

        has established itself as the foremost UK museum portal on-line with support 

        from the UK government Department of Culture. It has been officially designated 

        the first national virtual museum. This type of organization would be 

        in a good position to help museums with e-commerce opportunities by channeling 

        potential on-line shoppers to the relevant part of their website.<b></b></p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The leading on-line bookstore Amazon [<a

href="../http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">www.amazon.com</a>; <a

href="../http://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.amazon.co.uk</a>] has an associates 

        program in both the US and the UK in which any book sales generated result 

        in a 5&#150;15% commission depending on if the sales was due to an indirect 

        or direct hits on the Amazon site. Museums could partner with such facilities 

        to gain a percentage of the sales of books related to their museum with 

        little further effort once the facility is set up apart from maintaining 

        a suitable list of books with links to Amazon&#146;s website(s). A search 

        for &#147;museum&#148; on Amazon returned 29,212 results within the zShops 

        section (a collection of on-line stores) and 9,707 results in the books 

        section (in February 2002). There were even 9 results for computer and 

        video games, consisting of classic well-known games from the past for 

        a selection of more recent games consoles. The related CatalogCity.com 

        found 1,418 products from 89 merchants matching &#147;museum&#148; [<a

href="../http://www.catalogcity.com/" target="_blank">www.catalogcity.com</a>].<b></b></p>

      <p>The leading search engine Google [<a

href="../http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">www.google.com</a>] offers partner 

        opportunities. Google is an excellent state-of-the-at search engine that 

        returns very accurate results since it uses information about the hyperlinks 

        between web pages as well as the contents of the web pages themselves. 

        The use of Google technology to search only officially recognized museum 

        websites (e.g., as held by the museum portal) could reason in excellent 

        high-grade search results, useful for educational and other purposes. 

        For the record, a search for &#147;museum&#148; on Google resulted in 

        around 11.2 million pages, taking only 0.41 seconds (in February 2002). 

        Searching for the plural &#147;museums&#148; gave 3.31 million pages in 

        0.55 seconds. The Virtual Library museums pages (VLmp) were top of this 

        list [<a

href="../http://vlmp.museophile.com/" target="_blank">vlmp.museophile.com</a>].<b></b></p>

      <p>Yahoo provides on-line stores facilities to create on-line shops at a 

        reasonable price (around $100 per month upwards) [<a href="../http://store.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">store.yahoo.com</a>]. 

        It is be possible to partner with Yahoo to create an on-line shop for 

        an individual museum. This could be even more effective for a collection 

        of museums, perhaps with a related theme. This would allow easy cross-museum 

        shop searching for visitors. An advantage of a typical Yahoo store visitor 

        is that they may be more inclined to buy on-line than a usual museum virtual 

        visitor, who may be more interested in accessing information than shopping. 

        Yahoo provides a shopping portal for on-line shoppers [<a href="../http://shopping.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">shopping.yahoo.com</a>]. 

        Searching for &#147;museum&#148; via this portal resulted in 23,035 products 

        in 775 stores (in February 2002), so it can be seen that Yahoo has a significant 

        number of museum-related items offered for sale.</p>

      <p>eBay is a highly successful leading on-line auction site that is set 

        up to be easy for individuals and others to use [<a href="../http://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank">www.ebay.com</a>]. 

        Searching for the keyword &#147;museum&#148; resulted in 2,711 items being 

        found (in February 2002). The first 11 items were due to be sold within 

        an hour&#146;s deadline of the time of the search. Many items are described 

        using the term &#147;museum quality.&#148; eBay also runs on-line stores 

        as well as its well-known auction section [<a

href="../http://www.ebaystores.com/" target="_blank">www.ebaystores.com</a>].</p>

      <h1>Technology Issues</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>There are many technologies that can be used to aid 

        e-commerce, both proprietary and non-proprietary (Deitel, Deitel and Nieto, 

        2000). There are numerous books available to help with the design, implementation 

        and maintenance of facilities for web-based business e-commerce; e.g., 

        see Reynolds and Mofazali (2000).</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Although proprietary software may seem attractive initially, 

        especially because it often includes support, it is now possible to make 

        significant use of both open technical standards, and &#147;Open Source&#148; 

        [<a

href="../http://www.opensource.org/" target="_blank">www.opensource.org</a>] software 

        in developing software and website facilities (Ming-Wei Wu and Ying-Dar 

        Lin, 2001). This section outlines both these concepts, and explains their 

        relevance and benefits with respect to business-oriented applications 

        (Wall, 2001).</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The core technologies that comprise the Internet are 

        open standards, available for anyone to use freely for commercial and 

        non-commercial purposes. A business can attempt to extend the use of standardized 

        technologies for its own commercial purposes. For example, business-specific 

        file formats can now largely be derived from XML (Extensible Markup Language), 

        which is an open standard document description language coordinated by 

        the World Wide Web Consortium [<a href="../http://www.w3.org/XML" target="_blank">www.w3.org/XML</a>]. 

        The choice of XML as a basis for document design improves the accessibility 

        of document formats, including promoting their exchange and their translation 

        to other Internet standard document languages.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The Open Source software movement aims to create freely 

        available implementations of common application software. Open source 

        software is:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">available at no cost;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">available with source code;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">freely redistributable, with or 

          without modifications.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>A developer who makes modifications to an open source 

        application may (according to the particular terms of the license) be 

        obliged to make those modifications available under the same terms as 

        the original distribution. Open source software has a reputation for quality 

        and robustness, as it has a widely established &#147;peer review&#148; 

        mechanism; developers who find problems in the software can fix them and 

        contribute the corrections back into the main distribution of the software. 

        Examples of open source software in wide use on the Internet include the 

        Linux operating system [<a

href="../http://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">www.linux.org</a>] and the Apache 

        web server [<a

href="../http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank">www.apache.org</a>]. An open source 

        effort relevant to e-commerce is the OpenSSL Project to develop a robust, 

        toolkit implementing the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport 

        Layer Security) protocols for security on-line transactions, together 

        with a general-purpose cryptography library [<a href="../http://www.openssl.org/" target="_blank">www.openssl.org</a>]. 

        SourceForge is a major website that supports the collaborative production 

        of open source software [<a href="../http://sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">sourceforge.net</a>].</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>A major reason for adopting an open source strategy 

        could be because of the close association between the open Internet standards 

        and open source implementations of those standards. Having an open source 

        strategy could attract some customers who would otherwise be put off by 

        the continuing maintenance cost of a traditional &#147;closed source&#148; 

        application. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>However, open source software provides an &#147;insurance&#148; 

        benefit. Small enterprises can afford to experiment with open source software 

        knowing that they have no ongoing license fees. Furthermore, the source 

        code is available should anyone wish to migrate their data to a new application 

        framework in the future, or expand their use of open source software in 

        ways specific to meet their goals.</p>

      <h1>Other Issues</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>There are many books espousing principles for developing 

        a business on the World Wide Web; for example, see Schwartz (1998). However 

        there is not much information specifically aimed at museums wishing to 

        enter this area. A museum aiming to do so must typically seek outside 

        help, and hence must have substantial financial resources to do so. In 

        practice, this limits e-commerce to larger museums at present. For a smaller 

        museum to set up e-commerce requires considerable entrepreneurial spirit 

        (Southon and West, 2002) and technical expertise, but in time it will 

        become easier for such museums to market their shop items on-line. Normally 

        a museum will wish to outsource e-commerce facilities (e.g., to an application 

        service provider) and indeed often its entire website unless it is large 

        enough to warrant its own in-house support team (Susarla, Barua and Whinston, 

        2001).</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Fulfillment (delivery of the physical goods) is an 

        extremely important part of the e-commerce process. This is the one part 

        that cannot be achieved electronically. On a small scale, museums could 

        implement fulfillment directly from their physical shop. For a larger 

        turnover, use of a fulfillment center is more cost-effective, but this 

        does depend on a significant guaranteed volume to justify the expense 

        involved. On the other hand, fulfillment of delivery of data (e.g., images, 

        audio recordings, documents, etc.) could be achieved almost instantaneously 

        after purchase, the speed of Internet connection permitting. This could 

        be attractive way of selling photographs for a museum&#146;s archive, 

        for example. Issues to consider include the fact that the data could be 

        copied. Digital watermarking is one technique to monitor misuse of images 

        (e.g., for copyright protection) and this is still an active topic of 

        research; e.g., see Yiwei Wang, Doherty and Van Dyck (2002). For an overview 

        of digital watermarking issues, see De Vleeschouwer, Delaigle and Macq 

        (2002).</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Copyright concerns are of course extremely important 

        to museums (Wienand, Booy and Fry, 2000); a museum may own an object (e.g., 

        artwork) but not necessarily the copyright to reproduce it as an image. 

        In the UK, the Museums Copyright Group [<a href="../http://www.mda.org.uk/mcopyg" target="_blank">www.mda.org.uk/mcopyg</a>] 

        monitors and responds to copyright issues relevant to museums.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Undertaking e-commerce typically involves opening a 

        merchant account to allow credit cards to be accepted over the Internet. 

        A (commercial) guide on this process can be found on-line [<a

href="../http://www.gotmerchant.com/" target="_blank">www.gotmerchant.com</a>]. A 

        newer easier alternative is the sending of secure and cost-effective payments 

        via electronic mail. This is now possible using facilities provided by 

        the rapidly expanding California-based company PayPal [<a href="../http://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank">www.paypal.com</a>]. 

        Signing up for a PayPal account is free and it is particularly popular 

        with sellers on auction websites such as <a href="../http://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank">eBay</a>. 

        Currently payment is conducted using US dollars, but this could be extended 

        to Euros, for example, in the future.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Trust is very important for people when using e-commerce 

        facilities, as in real life commerce, and this must be built up and maintained 

        by providing a reliable secure service (Michener and Mohan, 2001). Recently, 

        Atif (2002) has proposed a network of Internet-based intermediaries to 

        help with this aspect. However trust involves human perception as well 

        as reliable security in practice so it is an inexact science.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Legislation and government intervention is likely to 

        be applied to e-commerce as a new form of trading. The US government provides 

        a website on its e-commerce policy [<a href="../http://www.ecommerce.gov/" target="_blank">www.ecommerce.gov</a>]. 

        The US Department of Commerce also provides information on e-commerce 

        [<a

href="../http://home.doc.gov/Electronic_Commerce/" target="_blank">home.doc.gov/Electronic_Commerce</a>]. 

        Information in the European Union is available from an electronic commerce 

        team [<a href="../http://europa.eu.int/ISPO/ecommerce/" target="_blank">europa.eu.int/ISPO/ecommerce</a>].</p>

      <h1>Future Directions</h1>

      <p>Most museums have restricted resources and are unable to undertake on-line 

        activities on their own, without the help of outside contractors. At the 

        simplest level, a museum may just require a basic website advertising 

        their existence (sometimes dubbed &#147;brochureware&#148; since the nearest 

        equivalent is the color brochure distributed by many museums), access 

        to the Internet and standard email facilities for museum personnel. This 

        is reasonably readily available in the general marketplace. However, at 

        the next level of sophistication, the Internet can be used for business 

        opportunities, both business to consumer (B2C or museum to visitor) and 

        business and business (B2B or business to museum), and also for more extensive 

        information dissemination, via a collections database for example. These 

        are less well supported for museums and are certainly potentially much 

        more expensive.</p>

      <p>Setting up an on-line shop for a medium-sized museum is a daunting prospect 

        and may well not attract much attention from the general public in any 

        case with significant marketing. However, if several hundred or even thousands 

        of museums were to combine to produce a museum shop of shops selling unique 

        items from the individual museums, this would have much more impact due 

        to the very size of the enterprise.</p>

      <p>The shop could be searchable by product type as well as by museum. Customers 

        could be guided to items suitable for particular gift ideas (e.g., for 

        children) as well to help finding appropriate suggestions quickly. Initially 

        fulfillment could be undertaken by individual museums, although a commercial 

        fulfillment center could be worthwhile for large volume items. Items chosen 

        by museums need to be unique for that museum ideally and also need to 

        be of reasonably high value and low weight for cost-effective delivery 

        to customers. </p>

      <p>A flexible approach to submitting orders to individual museums would 

        be required, using direct email or email to fax as appropriate, depending 

        on the facilities available at the museum. The ordering process should 

        be as automated as possible, and customers need to be kept informed of 

        progress or delays by email. Amazon is a widely known on-line company 

        that handles this aspect well [<a href="../http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">www.amazon.com</a>].</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Although many museums do already have their own websites, 

        many do not, often due to lack of technological expertise or perceived 

        costs. Facilities to allow museums to create and maintain there own website 

        with minimal technical expertise and at a reasonable cost could be useful 

        to many museums. Template structures for typical initial museum websites 

        and for page designs could be selected by the museum and further personalized 

        later as expertise is gained if desired. Facilities for easy uploading 

        of content such as text and images should be included.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Most museums, even if they have a computer database 

        for their collections, are not in a position to make this material available 

        on-line. Even those that have done so have normally implemented this on 

        an individual ad hoc basis in general. When museum users wish to visit 

        real museums, they must do so individually due to geographical separation. 

        However, on the Internet this is not the case even if the data is stored 

        in a distributed fashion. Many visitors may prefer a single portal to 

        find museum information, including searching across many databases simultaneously. 

        Existing museum standards such as <a href="../http://www.mda.org.uk/spectrum.htm" target="_blank">SPECTRUM</a> 

        in the UK should be followed to ensure compatibility (<b>mda</b>, 2002). 

        The Museum Documentation Association (aka <b>mda</b> [<a

href="../http://www.mda.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.mda.org.uk</a>]) supports documentation 

        standards and activities in the UK, including the use of databases and 

        Internet technology. The <b>mda</b> were an early adopter of the Internet 

        in the UK museum world and developed the SPECTRUM standard for collection 

        records and fields.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Educational resources are an important part of a museum&#146;s 

        remit. While facilities for children on-line are best made available free 

        of charge to ensure widespread usage, supporting material for teachers 

        could be marketed as on-line teachers&#146; packs. Multimedia interactives 

        and other resources could be helpful to attract and maintain the interest 

        of children on-line (Bowen and Houghton, 1999).</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Micropayments, where a very small charge (of the order 

        of a few cents) is levied for each page that is viewed, may open up the 

        realistic and reasonable provision of educational and other similar material 

        in the future. Unfortunately the implementation of micropayments has proved 

        problematic in practice and activity in this area coordinated by the World 

        Wide Web Consortium has been suspended [<a

href="../http://www.w3.org/ECommerce/Micropayments/" target="_blank">www.w3.org/ECommerce/Micropayments</a>]. 

        For the moment, it could be best to charge for supporting teacher&#146;s 

        resources and make pupil&#146;s resources freely available.<b></b></p>

      <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Museums require specialist equipment for exhibitions 

        and also more general items such as furniture and stationery. Individually, 

        museums, even large ones, have limited buying power. However, as a combined 

        force, they have significant strength. Currently there is no on-line B2B 

        marketplace explicitly for museums, even in the US. This is an area that 

        would need significant investment to develop and is very speculative.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>More generally for the future, the inventor of the 

        web, Tim Berners-Lee, is promoting the &#147;semantic web&#148; [<a

href="../http://www.semanticweb.org/" target="_blank">www.semanticweb.org</a>] as 

        the way forward for the further development and improvement of the web 

        (Berners-Lee, Hendler and Lassila, 2001). A DARPA Agent Markup Language 

        (DAML) effort, started in 2000, has the goal of developing a language 

        and tools to advance the aims of the semantic web [<a href="../http://www.daml.org/" target="_blank">www.daml.org</a>]. 

        The effort towards a semantic web could make searching the web much more 

        directed and intelligent than the current simplistic keyword approach 

        adopted by most search engines. This could improve the results of searching 

        for on-line information dramatically, including the searching for goods 

        for sales in on-line catalogues, for instance.</p>

      <h1>Museophile Plans</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Museophile Limited has recently been established by 

        the author and Michael Houghton, a web consultant, in the UK to help museums 

        with their on-line activities [<a

href="../http://www.museophile.com/" target="_blank">www.museophile.com</a>]. The 

        enterprise is supported by South Bank University [<a href="../http://www.museophile.sbu.ac.uk/" target="_blank">www.museophile.sbu.ac.uk</a>].</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Specifically, the company aims to help museums improve 

        their on-line accessibility, especially for the disabled (Bowen, 2001a). 

        There is currently little information on this area, although an on-line 

        article is available providing hyperlinks to a number of related resources 

        [<a

href="../http://www.museophile.sbu.ac.uk/access" target="_blank">www.museophile.sbu.ac.uk/access</a>]. 

        There are few books on the subject, but Paciello (2000) is a worthwhile 

        book for this wishing to find out more on this subject.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Legislation and standards will increasingly dictate 

        the accessibility of websites. For example, in the US, Section 508 covered 

        accessibility of Information Technology facilities made available by Federal 

        agencies for people with disabilities [<a href="../http://www.section508.gov/" target="_blank">www.section508.gov</a>]. 

        Further legislation and directives in the US and around the world are 

        likely. Even if a particular museum is not legally required to consider 

        accessibility of their website, now is a very good time to start considering 

        such issues. Ethically, disabled access is an area that all museums should 

        try to address in any case, be it to physical or virtual resources.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Currently it is widely accepted by museums and other 

        organizations that undertake interactivity with the general public that 

        their building must be accessible with suitable features like ramps, elevators, 

        etc. Similar considerations apply to websites. With the rapid diversification 

        of web technologies in recent years, many websites, including those of 

        museums, have been becoming less rather than more accessible. Some museum 

        sites have been designed with accessibility in mind (Bowen &amp; Bowen, 

        2000) and others have been explicitly investigated with a view to improving 

        their accessibility (Bowen, Brigden, Dyson and Moran, 2001).</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Museophile also has a funded project to produce an 

        example website demonstrating collaborative e-commerce involving a number 

        of museums. This project is currently underway and the results will appear 

        on-line under <a

href="../http://www.museophile.com/" target="_blank">www.museophile.com</a>. Initially 

        three UK museums are explicitly involved in the experiment, but we hope 

        others will join in due course if the pilot study is successful.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Other facilities supported by Museophile include discussion 

        forums to allow those interested in museums to post messages about topics 

        of concern. The site also provides support for the Virtual Library museums 

        pages (Bowen, 1997) along with a number of other sites that mirror this 

        facility around the world. Future areas for possible support include distributed 

        databases, business to business (or in this context &#147;business to 

        museum&#148; - B2M) e-commerce, education support, etc. It is likely that 

        Museophile will partner with a number of other sites to provide support 

        for facilities like on-line donations to museums, statistics gathering, 

        etc.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>E-commerce is very much in its infancy despite recent 

        advances, especially in the realm of museums. Some larger museums do have 

        on-line shops, but these have typically been undertaken as individual 

        initiatives. Museums sell a number of unique goods that may currently 

        only be available by visiting the museum in question. However, placing 

        these items on-line in an individual manner is likely to mean that they 

        are difficult to find by potential customers around the world. Acting 

        in a more coordinated manner is likely to gain much greater exposure since 

        an e-commerce site presenting items from many museums is likely to be 

        of much greater interest and to attract more visitors that an individual 

        website. The financial cost of involvement for smaller museums needs to 

        be as near to zero as possible; otherwise participation will not be attractive 

        for such museums. If a critical mass of museums could be reached, a significant 

        museum e-commerce website could be created. Certainly the unique set of 

        items available from museums, both large and small, around the world gives 

        the museum world a potentially very distinctive e-commerce resource. Prediction 

        is especially difficult in a fast developing area like the Internet (Bowen, 

        2000a), but it will be interesting to see how e-commerce develops in the 

        museum field over the years to come.</p>
