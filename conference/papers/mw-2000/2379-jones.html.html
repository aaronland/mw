      <p><b>Employing Identification in Online Museums</b></p>
      <p><b>Billie Jones, Penn State University, USA</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote><p><span class="small">Historically, museums have been the place of rare 
        and often valuable collections, preserved and displayed predominantly 
        for their aesthetic value. These collecting museums did not intend to 
        educate; however, after World War II, modern science museums and children's 
        museums were created around the message they wished to espouse rather 
        than a collection they wished to exhibit (Weinberg and Elieli. <i>The 
        Holocaust Museum in Washington </i>New<i> </i>York: Rizzoli, 1995: 50). 
        Instead of the collection as a museum's commodity, Eilean Hooper-Greenhill 
        concludes that "Knowledge is now well understood as the commodity that 
        museums offer<i> Museum, Message, MediaLondon</i>: Routledge, 1995: 2). 
        In discussing historical museums, Weinberg and Elieli state that in such 
        a museum, the narrative arranges knowledge like "building blocks in a 
        continuous story line [designed to] educate in the sense of changing and 
        developing their visitors mentally, emotionally, or morally (<i>The Holocaust 
        Museum</i> <i>in Washington</i> New York: Rizzoli, 1995: 49).Such education 
        is rhetorical, and as such requires, according to social critic Kenneth 
        Burke, the establishment of identification. He writes, "You persuade a 
        man only insofar as you can talk his language by speech, gesture, tonality, 
        order, image, attitude, idea, identifying your ways with his" (Burke, 
        <i>The Rhetoric of Motives</i> New York: Prentice-Hall, 1950: 55; original 
        emphasis). In order for a museum exhibit to persuade and thereby educate 
        its audience, it must establish identification with that audience.</span></p>
      <p><span class="small">Turning first to the physical presence of the United 
        States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), I will show how the designers 
        of the Permanent Exhibition of the USHMM have attempted to build identification 
        throughout the museum through the display of personal artifacts, as ordinary 
        and yet as intimate as shoes and toothbrushes; and photographs, which 
        emphasize the individual humanity of the victims rather than massive dehumanization 
        of entire cultural groups. After I have illustrated some of the ways in 
        which a physical museum attempts to establish identification, I will turn 
        my attention to the ways in which a museum's online presence can also 
        establish identification by which to educate and persuade its audience. 
        Demonstrating goodwill toward the audience of an online museum, a largely 
        anonymous and widely diverse audience, is more difficult than establishing 
        identification with visitors to a physical space. First of all, there 
        are no physical beings with whom to identify; cyberspace breeds an impersonal 
        environment. Furthermore, designers of online museum exhibits do not have 
        the luxury of spinning knowledge with a single, narrative thread; cyberspace 
        valorizes hypertextuality-not linearity. Nevertheless, online museum designers 
        can still work to establish identification with their cyber visitors. 
        Looking at the online presence of two Holocaust museums, the USHMM <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/">http://www.ushmm.org</a> 
        and Yad <a href="http://www.yad-vashem.org/">http://www.yad-vashem.org</a> 
        I will attempt to show design components that help to establish identification, 
        as well as to suggest other ways that identification could be utilized 
        in these online museums-and others.</span></p></blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">Museums are a culture industry that has evolved 
        over time. Historically, museums have been the place of rare and often 
        valuable collections, preserved and displayed predominantly for their 
        aesthetic value. These collecting museums did not intend to educate; however, 
        after World War II, modern science museums and children's museums were 
        created around the message they wished to espouse rather than a collection 
        they wished to exhibit (Weinberg and Elieli. <i>The Holocaust Museum in 
        Washington</i>. New York: Rizzoli, 1995: 50). Instead of the collection 
        as a museum's commodity, Eilean Hooper-Greenhill concludes that "Knowledge 
        is now well understood as the commodity that museums offer" (<i>Museum, 
        Message, Media</i>. London: Routledge, 1995: 2). In discussing historical 
        museums, Weinberg and Elieli state that in such a museum, the narrative 
        arranges knowledge like "building blocks in a continuous story line [designed 
        to] educate in the sense of changing and developing their visitors mentally, 
        emotionally, or morally" (<i>The Holocaust Museum in Washington</i>. New 
        York: Rizzoli, 1995: 49).</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In this paper, I will claim that such education 
        is rhetorical, and as such requires, according to social critic Kenneth 
        Burke, the establishment of identification. After discussing the concepts 
        of rhetoric and identification, I will turn first to the physical presence

        then, after I have briefly illustrated some of the ways in which a physical

        to the ways in which a museumís online presence, museumsí latest evolutionary 
        form, can also establish identification by which to educate and persuade 
        its audience. Looking at the online presence of two Holocaust museums, 
        the USHMM &lt;http://www.ushmm.org&gt; and Yad Vashem<br>
        &lt;<a href="http://www.yad-vashem.org.il/">http://www.yad-vashem.org.il</a>&gt;, 
        I will attempt to show design components that help to establish identification

        could be utilized in these online museumsóand others.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Rhetoric and Identification</b></p>
      <p class="normal">For twentieth-century rhetorical critic, Kenneth Burke, 
        persuasion,<i> rhetoric</i>, is everywhere. He claims that, ". . . wherever 
        there is 'meaning,' there is 'persuasion'" (Burke, <i>Rhetoric of Motives</i> 
        172). For Burke, the use of any system that makes meaning through symbols, 
        such as the most obvious language, but also those less obvious but equally 
        as meaning-making: architecture, visual images, and design arrangement 
        (physical and virtual) is persuasiveóis rhetorical. Integral to persuasion, 
        for Burke, is the concept of identification. He writes, &quot;You persuade 
        a man only insofar as you can talk his language by speech, gesture, tonality, 
        order, image, attitude, idea, <i>identifying your ways with his</i>&quot; 
        (Burke, <i>The Rhetoric of Motives</i>. New York: Prentice-Hall, 1950: 
        55; original emphasis). In order for a museum exhibit to persuade and 
        thereby educate its audience, it must establish identification with that 
        audience.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Examples of Identification</b></p>
      <p class="normal">The task of building identification is made difficult 
        in an historical museum, like the USHMM, because identification is difficult 
        with a people who are from a different time in history, from countries 
        different than one's own, and often from a different ethnic/religious 
        group. In many cases, visitors to the museum are not Jewish and the museum 
        must enable these visitors to identify with the Jewish victims. Furthermore, 
        no one wants to identify with the role of victim, yet this identification 
        is crucial for visitors to be persuaded that this unprecedented horror 
        could happen again, perhaps even to them, if they are not mindful. Moreover, 
        the magnitude of the group of victims--six million Jews, as well as millions 
        of other victims--makes identification difficult because such a large 
        group becomes an incomprehensible abstraction. </p>
      <p><span class="normal">The USHMM seeks to build identification and thereby 
        deny such an abstraction by particularizing and personalizing the victims. 
        Photographs are used in a variety of ways throughout the USHMM. Photographs 
        are the key component of the Yaffa Eliach Shtetl Collection, forming the 
        "Tower of Victims" exhibit, where hundreds of photographs chronicle fifty 
        years of Jewish life in a small town in what is now Lithuania. This three-story, 
        four-sided tower is covered with a pastiche of photographs depicting ordinary 
        people in ordinary situations: weddings, new babies, school and religious 
        rites of passage, working, or playing--simply people living. The museum 
        visitor walks through this tower on two floors of the exhibition. At the 
        earliest point, on the fourth floor, the visitor is only told that these 
        photographs are of Jewish villagers from one Shtetl; however, at the second 
        point of contact, the visitor learns that all but twenty-nine of the Jewish 
        residents of the Shtetl were killed in 1941, and that no Jews live there 
        today. By viewing these photographs twice, visitors are able to identify 
        with these people among the living, before being forced to accept them 
        as the dead. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In fact, few pictures are displayed showing masses 
        of humanity, living or dead. (An exception is the first photograph in 
        the Permanent Exhibition, which depicts American soldiers gazing in disbelief 
        at a charred heap of corpses. However, the corpses, in the lower foreground 
        of the photograph, are barely distinguishable upon first sight; what is 
        most apparent is the ring of Americans, who in the background of the photograph, 
        appear at the visitor's eye-level.) Instead, most photographs are of individuals, 
        and many of these photographs feature the individuals' faces. These individuals, 
        ordinary people ripped from ordinary circumstances and thrust into an 
        extraordinary situation, represent people from a variety of socioeconomic 
        classes and ages, both male and female, and this variety allows each visitor 
        to find someone with whom they can identify. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The voices of victims, as well, are heard in several 
        sections of the exhibition to promote identification. Most compelling 
        is the room where audio recordings of Auschwitz survivors can be heard 
        telling their stories of fear and survival. In the final part of the Permanent 
        Exhibition, a video runs continuously of survivors who give their "Testimony" 
        (also the title of this final exhibit). This video is particularly poignant 
        located on the heels of an exhibit that illustrates the plight of children 
        in the Holocaust, and includes artifacts such as clothing, toys, and drawings 
        made by children who were interned in the camps. The visitor is reminded 
        that these now elderly testifiers were children themselves during the 
        Holocaust, and to see these heartbreaking childhood experiences personified 
        in a surviving, adult form is moving because it makes real the experience 
        to which the previous exhibit has referred. This video is stirring also 
        because it concludes the Permanent Exhibition on a note of hope--some 
        people did survive--to bear witness to these horrors and the millions 
        who did not survive. As in the photographs, these victims are common, 
        ordinary people with whom most museum visitors can identify.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This theme of ordinariness through diversity as 
        a means of establishing identification is carried through many of the 
        artifactual displays. Immediately after leaving the railroad car, a grim 
        reminder of deportation and death, visitors see various suitcases strewn 
        about the ground beneath the car. This battered luggage is made more evocative 
        by the names scrawled across the leather by their owners, hopeful that 
        their journey would not end in death. Later, a display case contains piles 
        of victims' belongs, such as scissors, silverware, combs and brushes, 
        all diverse, yet demonstrating the ordinary humanity of their individual 
        owners. Most poignant is the display of 4,000 shoes brought from Majdenek. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Other types of clothing are displayed in a variety 
        of ways throughout the museum, as a means of establishing identification. 
        Soon after entering the fourth floor of the Permanent Exhibition, visitors 
        see several of the distinctive, striped prisoners' uniforms hanging limply 
        in a steel grille-work display case. This case, actually part of a three-story 
        tower (the height of which is not as evident to the visitor as it is in 
        "Tower of Victims"), is visible again on the last floor, near the end 
        of the Permanent Exhibition. In another instance, an early display case 
        holds, among other photographs, a Nazi uniform, not hanging limply, but 
        formed over a seemingly invisible body image. Although there is no visible 
        form, the illusion of a body is complete because the soldier's hat is 
        suspended a head's distance above the shirt collar of the uniform. By 
        keeping the enemy <i>faceless</i>, visitors may be able to see themselves 
        as a perpetrator. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Not only are these uniforms displayed in different 
        ways, the display cases that hold them are varied as well. The metal grille-work 
        that holds the prisoners' uniforms is reminiscent of a cage, symbolic 
        of the prisoners' harsh confinement, but this is an uncommon style of 
        display case in the Permanent Exhibition. Most of the exhibits, particularly 
        on the fourth floor, like the one that contains the Nazi uniform, are 
        housed behind glass walls, whose front panes are angled in toward the 
        floor, in order to invite the visitor into the display. This invitational 
        exhibit design helps visitors build identification with the contents, 
        by allowing them to feel a part of the display.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Moreover, larger architectural design features, 
        "freighted with meaning" (<i>For the Living</i>), help to build identification 
        by fostering empathy with the victims' predicament. Many of these features, 
        such as the use of brick, limestone, granite, exposed architectural concrete, 
        steel, and exposed pipes serve to simulate, in a minuscule way, the appearance 
        of the ghettos, the camps, and their crematoria. For instance, the doors 
        of the elevators, which transport visitors to the fourth floor where the 
        displays begin, are stark, brownish-gray steel, reminiscent of crematorium 
        doors.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Much of the Permanent Exhibition is devoid of natural 
        light. The most obvious exceptions to this are the two glass bridges through 
        which visitors walk from one section of the exhibition to the next. These 
        bridges, reminiscent of the overhead walkways that were erected in some 
        ghettos to prevent Jewish pedestrians from walking on non-ghettos streets, 
        are constructed of glass, which provides visitors with a view of the main 
        area, the Hall of Witness below. Even the floors are made of translucent 
        glass blocks, which although they admit light, prevent visitors from seeing 
        clearly what is below, just as the victims of the Holocaust could not 
        see the horrors that awaited them. These glass bridges serve as punctuation 
        to the museum's rhetorical text, giving visitors a chance to breathe before 
        embarking on the next line of the narrative. Not without discursivity, 
        the names of towns whose Jewish populations were decimated in the Holocaust, 
        and surnames of people who were victims are etched in white on the bridges' 
        glass walls, and these names serve an identifying function as well.</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="normal">Identification prompted by empathy is also a result 
        of the labyrinth-like spatial arrangement of the displays forming a downward, 
        chronological, constricting spiral which intensifies for the visitor just 
        as the situation intensified for the victims. In some instances, visitors 
        are able to stand in the very spot where victims stood, such as in one 
        of the railroad cars that transported millions of victims to their deaths. 
        Visitors can walk into the shell of a concentration camp barracks and 
        actually touch a wooden bunk in which prisoners were stacked like cords 
        of firewood. This spatial and palpable proximity with the victims allows 
        visitors to identify with them in a way that mere discursive text could 
        not. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Identification in a Web Museum</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Many of these, or at least adaptations of these 
        same means of establishing identification can be used in an online museum; 
        however, demonstrating goodwill toward the audience of an online museum, 
        a largely anonymous and widely diverse audience, is more difficult than 
        establishing identification with visitors to a physical space. First of 
        all, there are no physical beings with whom to identify; cyberspace breeds 
        an impersonal environment. Furthermore, designers of online museum exhibits 
        do not have the luxury of spinning knowledge with a single, narrative 
        thread; cyberspace valorizes hypertextualityónot linearity. Nevertheless, 
        online museum designers can still work to establish identification with 
        their cyber visitors. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Because of the hypertextual context of online museum 
        exhibits, designers have a responsibility and actually an opportunity 
        to guide site visitors through the inclusion of navigational cues and 
        devices, and ease of access and navigation are two ways that online exhibition 
        designs can demonstrate goodwill for their audiences. However, rather 
        than constructing a single narrative thread like that which binds the 
        physical space of the USHMM, online exhibit designers need to construct 
        an intricate web, of often infinite connections, and making these connections, 
        and the navigations between them clear demonstrates goodwill on behalf 
        of the online museum toward its audience. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Just as the architecture, and spatial/temporal arrangement 
        of the physical presence of the USHMM is arranged in such a way that identification 
        is established between visitor and the museum exhibitionís subject, an 
        online museum exhibition can be arranged in such a way to enhance understanding 
        and identification. At the online exhibition home page &lt;http://www.ushmm.org/exhibits/exhibit.htm&gt; 
        of the USHMM site, visitors can choose from eleven different linked images, 
        each one representing a particular special exhibit. After linking to an 
        exhibit, site visitors enter the exhibitís space, and each with its own 
        distinctive architecture. Although this distinctive architecture gives 
        each exhibit its own flavor, dissimilar design and navigational components 
        can be discomforting, and even confusing, to site visitors. At the USHMM 
        site, the exhibit entitled the &quot;Voyage of the St. Louis&quot; http://www.ushmm.org/stlouis/search/research/index.htm, 
        has a high degree of interactivity, prompting site visitors to choose 
        sets of research documents for four different passengers of the<i> St. 
        Louis</i>. Both the interactivity and evoked connections with individuals 
        lead site visitors to identify with its subject, as does the traditional 
        vertical scrolling to view individual pages in their entirety. However, 
        many of the pages in the exhibit, &quot;The Holocaust in Greece&quot; 
        (for example, <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/greece/eng/athens.htm">http://www.ushmm.org/greece/eng/athens.htm</a>), 
        use horizontal scrolling, which is virtually unmarked (except for the 
        browserís default navigational bars). While these are certainly sufficient, 
        given the unexpectedness of horizontal scrolling, inserting an extra line 
        of direction would better demonstrate goodwill toward site visitors. </span></p>
      <p class="normal">Within the architecture of these sites, photographs are 
        a common method by which an online museum can exhibit its holdings, both 
        photographs and artifacts. As I illustrated earlier in my discussion of 
        the physical space of the USHMM, the inclusion of photographs is an obvious 
        way to establish identification between a museumís audience and its subject, 
        and photographs are one of an online museumís best ways of conveying a 
        sense of their presence to site visitors, and thereby establishing identification 
        with their audience. However, in an online exhibition, photographs can 
        have both positive and negative effects on building identification. While 
        photographs can provide an important bridge across the impersonality of 
        cyberspace, the additional drag that multiple image files place on pagesí 
        loading speed can sometimes irritate or confuse site visitors, or even 
        overtax certain older systemsí capacities. Care must be taken to reduce, 
        as much as possible, the size of image files, without unduly sacrificing 
        visual quality. In such cases where the designer determines that the contribution 
        that image makes to the page is worth the extra loading time, then the 
        designer would be wise to add a notice to advise site visitors about possible 
        slow loading times. </p>
      <p class="normal">The same consideration would apply for video and audio 
        files that require special plug-ins or programs that are not widely available 
        on most computer systems. Any obstacles that stand between the web exhibit 
        and its audience can hinder identification, so designers must consciously 
        consider whether such large, slow loading files, possibly necessitating 
        the needless common system features, add sufficiently to the site to justify 
        their inclusion. One way of handling this possible obstacle is to make 
        mention of special system requirements at the beginning of the web exhibit. 
        For example, one particularly sophisticated site at the USHMM site, &quot;Hidden 
        History of the Kovno Ghetto&quot; (<a href="http://www.ushmm.org/kovno/index.htm">http://www.ushmm.org/kovno/index.htm</a>), 
        includes a link to &quot;technical notes&quot; which tells visitors of 
        audio/video requirements and even offers links to download sites for those 
        programs.</p>
      <p class="normal">Another aspect of web exhibition design that can contribute 
        in both positive and negative ways to the establishment of identification 
        is site sophistication. Some of the online exhibits of the USHMM, such 
        as the previously mentioned &quot;Kovno&quot; site, are quite sophisticated 
        in design, using design features like the layering of images and text 
        (e.g. <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/kovno/">http://www.ushmm.org/kovno/ 
        main.htm</a>). While these pages layer not only images, but meanings, 
        with their sophistication, they can put off some site visitors who lack 
        the technological savvy to feel comfortable in such spaces. For example, 
        in this particular exhibit, the concept of &quot;hidden-ness&quot; is 
        echoed by the hidden layers of images, visible only with mouse-overs. 
        While this creates a wonderful imaged extension of the metaphor, these 
        images, actually links to other segments of the site, may seem non-existent 
        to some site visitors, thereby not only thwarting identification, but 
        literally stopping movement throughout the site. As I have already mentioned 
        many times, care must be taken, by museum site designers to achieve a 
        balance between sophisticated content and possibly less than sophisticated 
        site visitors and their systems.</p>
      <p class="normal">The two sides of this balance can be seen by viewing online 
        exhibits for the USHMM and from Israelís Yad Vashem (<a href="http://www.yadvashem.org.il/collections/exhibits/main.html">http://www.yadvashem.org.il/collections/exhibits/main.html</a>). 
        The online exhibits for Yad Vashem are not nearly so adventurous as those 
        for the USHMM; linearity and convention abound in Yad Vashemís exhibits. 
        At many points, these two online museum sites seem at opposite ends of 
        a design continuum, and it is this continuum on which each online museum 
        designer must position oneself. The greatest chance of building identification 
        lies at the point of balance, and whatever a designer does, establishing 
        identification between the exhibitís subject and its visitors, is a useful, 
        and rhetorically powerful goal to be considered.</p>
