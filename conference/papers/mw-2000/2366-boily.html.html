      <p class="heading"><b>Access in the Distributed Environment: </b><b>Making 
        On-line Museum Content More Accessible to Educators</b></p>
      <p class="author"><b>Danielle Boily, Manager, Canadian Heritage Information 
        Network (CHIN), Canada</b></p>
      <p class="heading"><b><a href="http://www.chin.gc.ca/">http://www.chin.gc.ca</a></b></p>
      <p align="center" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="JUSTIFY" class="small">Since its inception, the Canadian Heritage 
          Information Network (CHIN) has been working closely with the Canadian 
          museum community. In recent years, CHIN has begun to expand this collaborative 
          working relationship to include the educational community. To date, 
          these joint ventures have resulted in the development of rich heritage 
          content for the Web, for the most part in the form of virtual exhibitions. 
          While the museum community is developing authoritative and valuable 
          heritage content for the WWW, access issues are making it difficult 
          for this material to be found by its intended audience(s). In an effort 
          to ensure access to these and other on-line heritage resources, CHIN 
          and the heritage and educational communities have collaborated on <i>Learning 
          with Museums</i>, a gateway to provide distributed access to on-line 
          learning materials created by Canadian museums and heritage associations. 
          <i>Learning with Museums</i> will ensure that on-line educational museum 
          content is made more accessible to educators, students and life-long 
          learners. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>The Project Team</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The Canadian Heritage Information 
        Network (CHIN) identified resources, defined an action plan, and managed 
        the development of this gateway application. CHIN was responsible for 
        defining the architecture/structure of the site and application. As the 
        host of the gateway, CHIN will ensure ongoing maintenance, promote continued 
        growth and continued improvement of the application. In the initial stages 
        of the project, CHIN formed a project team by contacting museums and others 
        who had expressed an interest in or had certain expertise in museum learning 
        materials, the Canadian curriculum, or distributed access tools. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The project team also included five 
        interns. CHIN manages a component of the Department of Canadian Heritageís 
        <i>Young Canada Works</i> <i>Internship Program</i>, part of Canadaís 
        <i>Youth Employment Strategy</i>. Through CHIN, internship funding was 
        provided to those organizations participating in the project that were 
        interested in hiring interns and demonstrated the ability to provide valuable 
        work experience and the necessary supervision. See Annex A for a list 
        of project team members and their contributions. </span> </p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Project Goal and Objectives </b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal"><span class="normal">The goal of the <i>Learning 
        with Museums</i> project is to make on-line educational museum content 
        more accessible to educators, students and life-long learners. In the 
        <i>Learning with Museums</i> project, museums create a metadata record 
        for each of their on-line resources, using a cataloguing tool provided 
        by CHIN. CHIN sends the metadata back to the museum, and they embed it 
        within their resource. CHIN can then harvest this embedded metadata periodically 
        in order to update its metadata repository. Although the resources in 
        <i>Learning with Museums</i> are distributed across various servers and 
        sites, the use of metadata makes it possible for users to perform powerful 
        searches of the learning materials as if they were part of a centralized 
        resource. The metadata embedded in the educational resources also has 
        the potential to enhance Internet search accuracy, improve resource discovery 
        capabilities, and facilitate cross-domain interoperability. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Users of Learning<i> with Museums</i> 
        are then able to directly search the metadata in order to quickly and 
        easily find the educational resources that meet their needs. When an appropriate 
        educational resource is found, users will link to it directly.</span></p>
      <p class="normal">Several objectives for the project were defined:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="normal">To develop metadata schemas and controlled vocabulary 
          required for enabling cataloguing of and access to learning materials.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">To develop tools and guidelines to enable museums 
          and heritage organizations to tag on-line educational resources.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">To develop a repository of metadata and pointers 
          of/to learning resources created by Canadian museums and heritage organizations, 
          currently available on-line.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">To develop a gateway interface to access indexed 
          learning materials created by Canadian museums and heritage organizations.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">To ensure that Canadian museum on-line materials 
          are well represented in broader directories and are made accessible 
          to other harvesters.</span> </ol>
          
      <p class="heading"><b>Review of Existing Models</b></p>
          
      <p class="normal"> As a point of departure, existing models for accessing 
	distributed on-line learning materials were investigated. The first of 
	the models is the Learning Resources section of Canada's SchoolNet (<a href="http://www.schoolnet.ca/">http://www.schoolnet.ca)</a>, 
	which offers access to learning resources by curriculum areas, grade levels, 
	themes, and keywords. As SchoolNet deals with Canadian curriculum and 
	provides bilingual access, CHIN's project team found it to be a useful 
	model.</p>
          
      <p class="normal">The Gateway to Educational Materials <A HREF="http://www.thegateway.org/">(http://www.thegateway.org</A>) 
	was also examined as a model for <i>Learning with Museums</i>. This initiative 
	of the National Library of Education and the U.S. Department of Education 
	was created in 1996 "to create an operational framework to provide America's 
	teachers with 'one-stop, any-stop' access to Internet-based educational 
	resources." As the Gateway to Educational Materials (GEM) is in its third 
	year of development, CHIN's project team was able to observe this very 
	impressive gateway, as well as its related tools and user guides, in operation. 
      </p>
          
      <p class="normal">CHIN also studied several other projects which enable 
	access to educational materials - SCRAN (Scottish Cultural Resources Access 
	Network, <a href="http://www.scran.ac.uk/">http://www.scran.ac.uk/</a>), 
	EdNA (Education Network Australia, <a href="http://www.edna.edu.au/">http://www.edna.edu.au/</a>), 
	and ADAM (the Art, Design, Architecture &amp; Media Information Gateway,<A HREF="http://www.adam.ac.uk/"> 
	http://www.adam.ac.uk/</A>). Included in this review was an evaluation 
	of their guidelines and tools to catalog/tag resources, search methodologies, 
	interfaces, retrieval strategies and access points.</p>
          
      <p class="normal">As a result of the analysis, aspects of these models were 
        incorporated into the development of the CHIN application. </p>
          
      <p class="normal">Part of the investigation of the existing models was to 
        determine whether there was a niche for a gateway that contained on-line 
        museum content exclusively. Due to the authoritative nature and high quality 
        of the content produced by museums, it was determined that providing access 
        to this material would be a benefit to all Internet users. The on-line 
        educational content developed by museums is often complemented by their 
        in-house educational programming, activities, and events; this broadens 
        the potential use and value of museum on-line material.</p>
           
          
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Metadata Schemas </b></p>
          
      <p class="normal">Metadata plays a very important role in the <i>Learning 
        with Museums</i> project. CHIN chose to adopt a metadata schema based 
        on that of the GEM project (which is in turn based on the Dublin Core 
        15-element data). CHIN's work was also informed by the metadata schema 
        used by Canada's SchoolNet.</p>
          
      <p class="normal">CHIN has been involved with developing guidelines for 
        using the Dublin Core in the museum and heritage context through its participation 
        in the Consortium for the Computer Interchange of Museum Information (CIMI) 
        testbed projects, and is currently using Dublin Core metadata in several 
        of its resources. CHIN wanted to continue to conform as closely as possible 
        to this international standard. </p>
          
      <p class="normal">As the <i>Learning with Museums</i> project started, the 
        Dublin Core Metadata Initiative was in the process of defining a set of 
        "qualifiers" to the 15 core elements. These qualifiers were to refine 
        the meaning of the elements in order to allow more precision. For the 
        <i>Learning with Museums</i> project, user requirements were such that 
        it was necessary to use Qualified Dublin Core to enable precision in retrieval. 
        Although the Dublin Core Qualifiers were not yet finalized by the time 
        the project started, CHIN adopted a set of qualifiers based on current 
        Dublin Core Qualifiers working drafts. </p>
          
      <p class="normal">In addition to the Dublin Core Elements and Qualifiers, 
        CHIN adopted metadata elements from the GEM schema, which contains eight 
        education-specific elements along with the Dublin Core 15-element data 
        set (see Annex B). </p>
          
      <p class="normal">A crosswalk between the SchoolNet, GEM metadata, and CHIN 
        metadata schemas was created, and the CHIN metadata schema was shared 
        with Canadian Studies, which is currently developing a database of off-line 
        educational materials. This will enable interoperability at various levels 
        between <i>Learning with Museums</i> and CHIN's project partners.</p>
          
      <p class="normal">The project team faced several challenges when trying 
        to find a way to express the metadata so that it could be interpreted 
        by harvesters. The <i>Learning with Museums</i> project required that 
        complex metadata (see Annex B) be embedded in HTML documents while being 
        compatible with all versions of Web browsers. Use of html metatags would 
        not enable the expression of a complex data structure in a standard way; 
        there was a lack of syntactic rules, creating ambiguities which the parser 
        could not overcome. There was no syntax to express groupings of elements, 
        given that there were repeating elements and qualifiers a syntactic qualifier 
        was needed. Without a standard, no harvester would be able to interpret 
        the metatags in a reliable way. </p>
          
      <p class="normal">The chosen solution was to embed XML (Extensible Markup 
        Language) in HTML documents using RDF (Resource Description Framework). 
        With XML, CHIN was able to utilize the CIMI Dublin Core DTD (Document 
        Type Definition) and create a CHIN DTD that defines a more complex data 
        structure. RDF provides the syntax for DC, GEM, and CHIN elements; and 
        the DTD provides the grammar and the structure that will allow other resource 
        discovery tools to interpret the RDF. The CHIN project team used "abbreviated 
        RDF", so that the RDF metatags could be embedded in the museums' html 
        Web pages; if "serialized RDF" had been used, extraneous RDF information 
        outside of the RDF tags would be displayed when using some of the older 
        web browsers.</p>
          <b> </b> 
          
      <p class="normal">An important consideration in the choice of RDF was an 
        article entitled, "Guidance on expressing DC in RDF". This article is 
        a Working Draft of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) which has 
        been offered to the Dublin Core Advisory Committee for acceptance and 
        ratification. This document states that "...only the combination of RDF 
        and XML currently offers the range of capabilities required to fully express 
        the richness of both qualified and unqualified Dublin Core in an unambiguous 
        manner." It was important that CHIN follow the direction of the DCMI to 
        allow for future interoperability.</p>
          
      <p class="normal">Another consideration was that XML and RDF are World Wide 
        Web Consortium (W3C) standards, which means that there is a large user 
        community. Other users have created tools using these standards, which 
        can be adopted or used as models. Another benefit of using a W3C specification 
        is that there is ample resource material available on-line, which is very 
        helpful during the development process. </p>
          
      <p class="heading"><b>Controlled Vocabulary</b></p>
           
          
      <p class="normal">Dublin Core, GEM, and SchoolNet have each created controlled 
        vocabularies and/or format standards to be used with their metadata element 
        sets. CHIN was able to adopt or adapt many of these standards. However, 
        as CHIN is dealing with bilingual content, some of the existing vocabularies 
        had to be translated in order to enable bilingual access to the resources. 
        A thesaurus was also created to deal with bilingual subject access.</p>
          
      <p class="normal">In order to create a subject browser to be used in both 
        cataloguing and retrieval of the learning resources, subject terms were 
        drawn from each provincial and territorial curriculum. Due to the fact 
        that some provincial/territorial curricula are currently under review, 
        the application will need to be updated as new protocols are defined. 
        As well, for the first phase of the project, only subject terms drawn 
        from grades 7 -13 curricula were included. As this is a dynamic and evolving 
        application, in subsequent phases, the project will also look at curricula 
        below grade 7. </p>
           
          
      <p class="normal">Although controlled vocabularies are used extensively 
        in this project to ensure resource discovery, the resources can also be 
        described with uncontrolled vocabulary to allow freedom of expression 
        and alternatives to the controlled vocabulary.</p>
           
          
      <p class="heading"><b>The Cataloguing Tool</b></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
          
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">In order to assist museums with the task 
        of embedding metadata in their on-line educational resources, CHIN created 
        a cataloguing tool. This tool allows museums to catalogue their educational 
        resources using an on-line form which then outputs metadata (as dictated 
        by the metadata schema) which can be embedded in the museums' HTML pages. 
        The cataloguing tool allows users to select terms from controlled vocabularies 
        and/or provides suggestions from lists of uncontrolled terms. The resulting 
        metadata is sent to the museums for incorporation into their resources. 
      </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
          
      <p class="normal">GEM's cataloguing tool, "GEMCat" was used as a model. 
        The model was adapted for the needs of the Canadian heritage and educational 
        communities. The adaptations related to issues of maintenance, distribution, 
        and technological limitations. For example, GEMCat is used either on- 
        or off-line by a select group of highly trained users. CHIN's cataloguing 
        tool will be available only on-line, to avoid problems of distribution 
        and maintenance among a large, continually changing group of users. GEMCat 
        is a Java application; CHIN's cataloguing tool is web-based, in order 
        to ensure that it can be used with various Web browsers.</p>
          
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">For this first phase of the project, the 
        CHIN project team catalogued resources on behalf of the museums; for subsequent 
        phases of the project, the goal is to have the museums catalogue their 
        own resources using the cataloguing tool and the guidelines provided by 
        CHIN. The gateway will quickly become more comprehensive as museums begin 
        to use the cataloguing tool to create the metadata for their own resources.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
          
      <p class="normal">It is hoped that as metadata begins to play a more central 
        role in other applications, the CHIN cataloguing tool (and the metadata 
        schema) can be extended so that it can be used for content description 
        in disciplines other than education. For example, it could be used to 
        catalogue cultural tourism resources as well as educational resources. 
      </p>
          
      <p class="heading"><b>The Metadata Harvester</b></p>
           
          
      <p class="normal">Another important part of the <i>Learning with Museums</i> 
        gateway is the metadata harvester. After the museums have used the cataloguing 
        tool to create and embed metatags in their on-line resources, the harvester 
        will be used for automated collection of the metadata. The harvester will 
        periodically crawl identified CHIN member museum Web sites, and retrieve 
        the metatags within the educational resources. The collected metadata 
        will then be stored in a periodically updated database that can be searched 
        by users of <i>Learning with Museums</i>.</p>
           
          
      <p class="normal">In the future, it is hoped that the harvester will be 
        able to interpret and collect metadata created by other tools in addition 
        to the CHIN cataloguing tool. </p>
          
      <p class="heading"><b>Outcomes</b></p>
           
          
      <p class="normal"><i>Learning with Museums</i> provides learners with an 
        efficient and easy-to-use resource for accessing on-line educational Canadian 
        museum content. Users of all types can trust that the material that they 
        are accessing and using comes from a credible, authoritative source - 
        the Canadian museum community.</p>
          
      <p class="normal">In addition to the benefit to learners and the educational 
        community, the museum community benefits by having their material easily 
        accessible by the target audience(s). The tools and guidelines, provided 
        by the <i>Learning with Museums</i> project, will provide a model for 
        museums wanting to catalogue their material. As the metadata embedded 
        in museums' resources is based on an international standard, the Dublin 
        Core, it is hoped that Internet search engines will also eventually be 
        able to read the embedded metadata and discover the museums' resources. 
      </p>
          
      <p class="normal">For this phase of the project, to ensure that Canadian 
        museum materials are well represented in broader directories, the gateway 
        includes reciprocal hyperlinks with Canada's SchoolNet, the Canadian Studies 
        off-line materials database (will be accessible on-line to give access 
        to records of off-line learning materials produced by the federal government, 
        such as books, videos, CD-ROMs etc) and GEM. Because these projects have 
        used common standards, it may be possible to integrate the projects more 
        closely in the future.</p>
          
      <p class="normal"><i>Learning with Museums </i>is an exciting step in the 
        goal to further develop access in the distributed environment. Those interested 
        in finding out more or contributing to <i>Learning with Museums</i>, please
