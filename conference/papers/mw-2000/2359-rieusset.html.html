        Networks (Extensions of Walter Benjamin's Insights)</b></p>
      <p class="abstract"><b>Isabelle Rieusset-Lemari&eacute;, I.U.F.M. de Versailles, 
        France</b></p>
      <p align="center" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote>
          
        <p class="small">This paper will trace the emergence of memory as a specific 
          problem for Web Museums. Museums are not only dedicated to cultural 
          heritage: they embody a specific conception of memory and patrimony. 
          But Web Museums are faced with increasingly pressing issues of memory 
          in the age of digital documents and multimedia reproduction. While digital 
          multimedia networks condition the emergence of new patterns dealing 
          with memory, Web Museums may condition, the evolution of these patterns. 
          We shall trace the dissemination of artistic heritage in the age of 
          globalization not just as problem of size but as integral to art. It 
          is the necessary interconnection of memory and art that will clarify 
          how problems of technical reproducibility and experience are presented 
          and conceptualized within elements of cultural heritage in the age of 
          globalization. The technical reproducibility that is taken to characterize 
          digital multimedia memory pertains not just to the nature of electronic 
          networks but also to any thinking of the artwork and thus of the art 
          Web museums. </p>
          
        <p class="small">W. Benjamin emphasized the great capacities of technical 
          reproduction in matters of preservation. But he called attention to 
          the serious need for another kind of transmission of memory, dealing 
          with art, to ensure that memory will be disseminated in the future, 
          not just as information, but as experience. Our point is to suggest 
          that the dissemination of cultural heritage in the age of digital networks 
          deals with the transmission of memory as experience and that Web Museums 
          have a specific role to play as far as this artistic approach to memory 
          is concerned. Consequently particular attention will be given to those 
          artworks for which the net is not only a tool for technical reproduction 
          but the very texture of the artwork and the exhibition place for its 
          appearance or disappearance. </p></blockquote>
          
        
      <p class="heading"><b>Introduction</b></p>
      
      <p><span class="normal">The "posthumous fame" (ARENDT, 1968) of Walter Benjamin 
        appears self evident when you are tracing paths through the Internet: 
        you can't escape encounter with his name in the numerous Web pages dealing 
        with the outcome of the artwork in the age of digital reproduction or 
        the specific prospects of Virtual Museums.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Nevertheless, the way in which Benjamin's ideas 
        are revealed to in this context often reveals a set of misunderstandings. 
        Some people refer to Benjamin's nostalgia on account of the loss of aura 
        in the very essay in which he valued artwork's emancipation from the ritual 
        cult of aura, thanks to the techniques of reproduction. Others don't take 
        into account Benjamin's later texts where he pointed out the damages wrought 
        by the technical reproducibility that threatened to disappearance the 
        kind of memory in which aura is "at home" (BENJAMIN, 1939). </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">If you are considering both sides of Benjamin's 
        analysis of technical reproducibility, you can avoid one-sided reconstruction 
        of his thought. But if you emphasize the shift in Benjamin's analysis 
        to such a point as to pretend that Benjamin has said one thing and the 
        reverse about technical reproducibility and aura, you are forging a characiture 
        of his work which reduces the complexity of his thought to banal contradictions. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The consistency of the work of Walter Benjamin does 
        not resemble the compactness of an homogeneous block. Metaphors are the 
        privileged links which determine the paths in this woven structure. To 
        grasp the consistency of Benjamin's analysis, the main metaphors in which 
        he crystallized his thought must be deciphered. That was part of the work 
        of my last book (RIEUSSET-LEMARIE 1999) in which I tried to point out 
        the links between his famous essay, "The work of art in the age of mechanical 
        reproduction" (BENJAMIN, 1936a), and his last essay entitled "Theses on 
        the Philosophy of History" which is recognized as the most synthetic part 
        of his work. One of the crucial metaphors in this last essay is embedded 
        in this last paragraph :</span></p>
     <blockquote>
        <p class="normal">'A historical materialist approaches a historical subject 
          only where it encounters it as a monad. /.../ He takes cognizance of 
          it in order to blast a specific era out of the homogeneous course of 
          history -blasting a specific life out of the era or a specific work 
          out of the lifework. As a result of this method the lifework is preserved 
          in this work and at the same time cancelled; in the lifework, the era; 
          and in the era, the entire course of history. The nourishing fruit of 
          the historically understood contains time as a precious but tasteless 
          seed.' (BENJAMIN, 1940, p. 254)</p>
   </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">I tried to show that this metaphor of the seed of 
        time not only supported the consistency of this last essay, it helped 
        to trace the path from Benjamin's last essay to his famous one about artwork's 
        mechanical reproduction, through the complex areas in which Benjamin peered 
        at the specific obstacles to be overcome in the age of technical reproduction, 
        in order to preserve memory as the dimension from which emerge, not only 
        the past, but the possibility of the dissemination of time itself.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This image of time as a seed enlightens not only 
        Benjamin's theses about history and memory, but the role of aesthetics 
        in the age of technical reproducibility. The specific aesthetic power 
        conveyed by the techniques of reproduction must cause a shock in order 
        to blast a new time out of the reign of the tradition based on the value 
        of aura. In this famous essay, Walter Benjamin presents this aesthetics 
        of shocks as related to the aesthetics of "distraction", or what is translated, 
        both in French and in English, by the word "distraction", to convey the 
        German word <i>Zerstreuung</i>. But this translation doesn't help the 
        reader to grasp the consistency of Benjamin's' conception, which oppose 
        this aesthetics of <i>Zerstreuung</i> to the reign of aura.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">If you pay attention to the definition of this German 
        word, you discover that "distraction" is only given as the second sense 
        of this word by the <i>Wahrig Deutsches W&ouml;rterbuch</i>. Its first 
        sense, given by the German dictionary <i>Langenscheidts Gro&szlig;w&ouml;rterbuch 
        Deutsch-Franz&ouml;sich</i>, is "dispersion, dissemination, scattering". 
        The opposition underlined by Benjamin between <i>Zerstreuung</i> and the 
        recollection, the religious contemplation which was typical of the traditional 
        perception of the work of art, becomes more clear than with the translation 
        of <i>Zerstreuung</i> by "distraction". The scattered movement of the 
        aesthetics of the dissemination is opposed to the recollection intimated 
        by the aura of the artwork.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Literally, the word dissemination refers to the 
        dispersion or the releasing of the seed. The dehiscence releases the seed 
        contained in the fruit and makes its dissemination possible. That is exactly 
        the metaphorical image chosen by Benjamin in order to depict the liberation 
        of time from the homogeneous course of history. But this metaphor is already 
        present in his essay "The work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction". 
        The aim is the liberation of the seed from the containment of the tradition 
        embodied by the aura. The German word for aura in this essay is <i>H&uuml;lle</i>. 
        One of the meanings of <i>H&uuml;lle</i> is <i>H&uuml;lse</i> which refers 
        to<i> "Schale um Samen", </i>the external part of the fruit that protects 
        its precious treasure : "Samen", the seed. But the <i>H&uuml;lle</i> must 
        be husked in order to liberate the seed. In artworks, maturation is not 
        enough: a shock may be necessary to liberate the seed. That is why the 
        aesthetics of shock and the aesthetics of dissemination are closely associated 
        in order to destroy the <i>H&uuml;lle</i>, the power of aura that stores 
        the secret treasure that could be preciously disseminated: the seed of 
        time.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The techniques of reproduction desire dissemination 
        of cultural heritage instead of the conservation of precious artworks 
        in confidential secret places. Web Museums can be useful tools to achieve 
        this aim. But in Benjamin's view, the objective is not only to exhibit 
        artworks, but to convey another relation to time. Time mustn't be petrified 
        in a mausoleum. The challenge for Web Museums is to establish a vivid 
        relationship between memory and time as a germination power providing 
        metamorphosis and not only as petrified images of a dead past.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We will first examine the obstacles encountered 
        by Web Museums as far as this vivid conception of memory is concerned. 
        Then we will analyze the new prospects of the aesthetics of dissemination 
        and the new challenge encountered by Web Museums in order to blast the 
        transmission of memory as a vivid experience out of the threats of reification 
        induced by the techniques of information and reproduction. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>1. Memory as information: the damages of the aversion 
        to aura in 'cybernetic museums'.</b></p>
      <p class="normal">Walter Benjamin not only used the metaphor of the seed 
        of time to value the aesthetics of dissemination as opposed to aura. We 
        find the same metaphor in order to stigmatize information as opposed to 
        the art of storytelling. Benjamin acknowledges Herodotus as the master 
        of this art:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">Herodotus offers no explanations. His report is 
          the driest. That is why this story from ancient Egypt is still capable 
          after thousand of years of arousing astonishment and thoughtfulness. 
          It resembles the seeds of grain which have lain for centuries in the 
          chambers of the pyramids shut up air-tight and have retained their germinative 
          power to this day (BENJAMIN, 1936b, p. 90).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">Information would lack this specific germinative 
        power of time that appears as the fundamental principle in Benjamin's 
        view: </span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">The value of information does not survive the 
          moment in which it was new. It lives only at that moment; it has to 
          surrender to it completely and explain itself to it without loosing 
          any time. A story is different. It does not expend itself. It preserves 
          and concentrates its strength and is capable of releasing it even after 
          a long time (BENJAMIN, 1936b, p. 89).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">Information will no longer be new after the moment 
        of its revelation. On the contrary, Benjamin valued the kind of novelty 
        which can be perceived as new, after a long time, because it has the germinative 
        power of creating others novelties in a different context. According to 
        Benjamin, the seed of time is the germinative power without which the 
        possibility of the irruption of something new can't survive. In his definition, 
        Information is something that destroys this specific power of time.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Notwithstanding Benjamin's critical approach of 
        information, Andrea Witcomb depicts the new conception of museums based 
        on information, as a scheme that fits Benjamin's opposition to the reign 
        of aura :</span></p>
      <blockquote>

        of information emphasized by Andrea Witcomb are clearly innovations compared 
        with the kind of information stigmatized by Walter Benjamin. But does 
        this new conception of information escape the damage of reification? Does 
        it fit the claim for generating, not a petrified recollection, but a germinative 
        memory? Andrea Witcomb also emphasizes this claim: </span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">Technology is crucial in turning the museum from 
          a repository to an information resource. In this light it is interesting 
          to take note of an article entitled "The intelligent museum", by Eiji 
          Mizushima, a Japanese systems engineer involved in the construction 
          of new museums. Mizushima defined the contemporary museum in terms of 
          information, a concept which he places in opposition to old fashioned 
          museums which he saw as static receptacles (WITCOMB, 1997).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">Andrea Witcomb denounces the petrified conception 
        of the museum that looks like a mausoleum. But the "intelligent museum", 
        as depicted by Mizushima, doesn't seem to meet this requirement:</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">An intelligent museum is one that (a) can control 
          automatically museum operation and management and exhibit management; 
          (b) can control the museum environment (exhibit environment and conservation 
          environment); (c) is structurally equipped, both within and without, 
          with information/communication capabilities; and (d) can control with 
          computers and 'new media' equipment a visitor information service. (Mizushima, 
          1989, p. 242). </span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">If this "intelligent museum" is no longer a mausoleum 
        it resembles the "cybernetic museum" depicted by Bernard Deloche as a 
        dematerialized conception of a Museum based on information (DELOCHE, 1989). 
        The museum is no longer a receptacle for collections. The achievement 
        of the 'cybernetic museum' is to substitute information in place of objects 
        that are no longer necessary. Bernard Deloche went so far as to present 
        the inventory as the "pure museum": an ideal form of museum in which artworks 
        are no longer presents. That is the extreme consequence of a conception 
        of the museums which emphasize the diffusion of information at the expense 
        of the goal of conservation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">But objects have not only a conservatory value in 
        art museums. Bernard Deloche forgets the aesthetic dimension that is an 
        integral part of the mission of diffusion in art museums. On the pretense 
        that an inventory or a data base can disseminate all the necessary information 
        about the "system of forms" embedded in the artwork, he declares that 
        the ideal type of the "cybernetic museum" can achieve a derealized conception 
        of the museum. We are confronting here the negative exacerbation of a 
        dematerialized conception of information as opposed to the claim of spatialization. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This model of a dematerialized Museum based on information 
        can be a temptation for Web Museums. But thanks to the techniques of Virtual 
        Reality, the paradigm of information has evolved and is no longer opposed 
        to the claim of spatialization. The browser "City of news" presented in 
        Siggraph'99, is a useful tool to of this new tendency. It spatializes 
        Web pages as sky-scrapers and represents the navigation of the visitor 
        in search of information as a promenade in the streets of a city. The 
        longing for encounters with 3D objects in a realistic 3D environment changes 
        the aspect of Internet that is still considered as a global virtual library 
        or museum, full of information, but that should be spatialized in an architectural 
        form in order to facilitate the paths of its users. The planetary virtual 
        museum is often considered as a virtual city in which each local Web Museum 
        looks like a district having its own architectural style. In this architectural 
        scheme, the role of virtual objects is important in Web Museums which 
        must disseminate not only information, but aesthetic effects. The virtual 
        objects exhibited may be virtual artworks or digital reproductions, but 
        even a reproduction has an aesthetic specific effect which is not reducible 
        to its informative value. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The temptation to equate the techniques of information 
        and the techniques of reproduction, on the pretense of their common opposition 
        to the conservatory conception of museums as sacred repositories, tends 
        to nourish confusion between the valorization of the dissemination of 
        information and the hatred of objects as if they were bound to involve 
        the traditional cult of aura.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Andrea Witcomb also value museums without artworks, 
        on account of the emancipation of the conception of the museum as a sacred 
        repository :</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">the Australia-USA Gallery at the Australian National 
          Maritime Museum /.../ is interesting for it combines an indifference 
          to the status of objects with the way it uses electronic technology 
          as well as reproductions in its displays. The loss of the sanctity of 
          the object /.../ is apparent in the way in which the opening exhibition 
          for the USA-Australia gallery was developed./.../These display techniques 
          highlight the way in which objects have lost their central position 
          within museum activity (WITCOMB, 1997).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">The fact that the techniques of information and 
        the techniques of reproduction are put on the same level because of their 
        common indifference to the status of objects is problematic. Under the 
        pretense of destroying the traditional vision of the museum as a temple 
        for artworks, objects are reduced to the longing for the authenticity 
        of aura:</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">To begin with, photography became extremely important 
          to the gallery's activities as did film. For example, if objects were 
          not available for loan, particularly those located in America, a photograph 
          was requested instead. These eventually became graphics with accompanying 
          labels, having a similar status as objects in their narrative role. 
          The value of both was defined in terms of information. The juxtaposition 
          of graphics and objects is one of the means by which the opposition 
          between an original and its copy is currently being confused. The focus 
          on information has meant that messages previously communicated by the 
          object alone can now be communicated as effectively by a photographic 
          image. Graphics became important not only as background material, providing 
          context for the objects, but as artifacts in their own right. A reproduction 
          is just as valuable as the original for this purpose, despite a residual 
          sense of loss amongst the curators that the original was unavailable 
          for display. The mystique of authenticity had all but disappeared (WITCOMB, 
          1997).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">Witcomb points out the fact that reproductions are 
        not only valuable tools when the artworks are not available. But if a 
        photographic reproduction can be as interesting as the original artwork, 
        it is because it conveys specific artistic effects as Malraux put it splendidly 
        in his 'Mus&eacute;e imaginaire'. Photograph is valuable, in this context, 
        not as a mere information tool but as an artwork. The fact of considering 
        both artwork and reproduction in terms of information denies their specific 
        artistic interest in order to present them as equivalent. We are not in 
        Benjamin's perspective which values reproductions because they convey, 
        not only information, but aesthetic effects. The pretense to consider 
        the substitution of a graphic, of a mere information, in the place of 
        a work of art as if it were the same thing than to substitute a reproduction 
        in the place of the original, does not fit Benjamin's prospect which was 
        integral to aesthetics. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This confusion between the role of the techniques 
        of information and the role of the techniques of reproduction is symptomatic 
        to the exacerbation of the aversion to aura. Witcomb's critical approach 
        of memory as a mausoleum fits Benjamin's prospects. But the difference 
        between Witcomb and Benjamin lies in the fact that this latter underlined 
        the necessity of preserving something valuable in aura, in so far as aura 
        is linked with a vivid conception of memory that is threatened by the 
        technical reproducibility.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>1.2. Memory as experience: from Benjamin's positive 
        redefinition of the aura to the role of aesthetics of dissemination in 
        Web Museums.</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Under the influence of Proust and of Baudelaire, 
        W. Benjamin reconsiders the role of aura, in a positive way, as it is 
        related to memory. This new approach leads Benjamin to emphasize some 
        negative damages wrought by the techniques of reproduction:</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">If we designate as aura the associations which, 
          at home in the m&eacute;moire involontaire, tend to cluster around the 
          object of a perception, then its analogue in the case of a utilitarian 
          object is the experience which has left traces of the practiced hand. 
          The techniques based on the use of the camera and of subsequent analogous 
          mechanical devices extend the range of the m&eacute;moire volontaire; 
          by means of these devices they make it possible for an event at any 
          time to be permanently recorded in terms of sound and sight. Thus they 
          represent important achievements of a society in which practice is in 
          decline. To Baudelaire there was something profoundly unnerving and 
          terrifying about daguerreotypy;/.../ Nevertheless, Baudelaire tried 
          to take a more conciliatory view. Photography should be free to stake 
          out a claim for ephemereal things, those that have a right 'to a place 
          in the archives of our memory,' as long as it stops short of the 'region 
          of the intangible, imaginative': that of art /.../. The perpetual readiness 
          of volitional, discursive memory, encouraged by the technique of mechanical 
          reproduction, reduces the scope for the play of the imagination (BENJAMIN, 
          1939).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">W. Benjamin is not only under the influence of Proust 
        and Baudelaire while he emphasizes the value of memory. Memory and time 
        are integral parts of his philosophy. The focus on memory is not a shift 
        in his work. The change lies in the approach of the role of the techniques 
        of reproduction. In so far as these latter are associated to the volitional 
        memory, they would convey an archivist conception of memory which may 
        reveal helpful, but which doesn't fit the specific kind of memory that 
        is related to art. Benjamin encounters an obstacle. We are confronting 
        the climax of the contradiction in his work. But Benjamin will point out 
        the devices to resolve the contradiction. In the paralipomena of the "Theses 
        on the Philosophy of History", he will value the role of 'Humankind's 
        involuntary memory'. This latter can cause the shock which is necessary 
        in order "to blast open the continuum of history". Benjamin's conception 
        of aesthetics of shock is still present. The positive role of the involuntary 
        memory is emphasized in relation with the new definition of aura and in 
        relation with the prospects of destroying a continuum. The new conviction 
        of Benjamin lies in the conscience that the discontinuum also needs a 
        transmission. Hence there would be two kinds of aura. The first one is 
        associated with the continuum of the tradition. But the other aspect of 
        aura, "at home" in the "m&eacute;moire involontaire" is related to the 
        transmission of the discontinuum. The shift in Benjamin's conception emphasizes 
        the role of the irruption of the discontinuum (thanks to the "m&eacute;moire 
        involontaire" and, consequently, thanks to aura) in order to blast the 
        seed of time out of the continuum of homogeneous history. From 'The work 
        of art in the age of mechanical reproduction" to the "Theses on the Philosophy 
        of History", Benjamin's fundamental value is the dissemination of time 
        which must be liberated from a continuum. The role of image to cause the 
        shock is present in both essays. The only change is that Benjamin declares 
        that this shock will come from the involuntary memory while he previously 
        declared that the aesthetics of shock was conveyed by the techniques of 
        reproduction.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Benjamin also associated the techniques of reproduction 
        with the aesthetics of dissemination. In 1936, Benjamin believed in the 
        ability of these techniques to liberate the seed of time. But in order 
        to achieve this aesthetics of dissemination, the techniques of reproduction 
        must not be associated exclusively with the volitional memory and with 
        an archivist approach of memory. Hence, the challenge of the technical 
        reproducibility is to convey the "m&eacute;moire involontaire" which implies 
        a discontinuum in memory and requires images emerging from this discontinuum. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">J.L. Leutrat showed that J.L. Godard, in his film 
        <i>Passion</i>, has achieved a work of art that is realized thanks to 
        the techniques of reproduction, but that fits Benjamin's conceptions in 
        the "Thesis of the Philosophy of history":</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">Godard restores to their places those history 
          left out, the perpetual losers -- workers and crowd actors. In the same 
          way, he fights to disclose a concealed past : the history of cinema, 
          according to the Introduction, "is impossible because the way the images 
          remain has been organized by the industry in such a way that history 
          cannot be told" (GODARD, 1980, p. 301). A solidarity exists between 
          the history of cinema and history itself : the latter is required in 
          order to tell the former, even in the form of "tableaux vivants"./.../"This 
          memory is entirely on the side of oblivion, and it recalls the past 
          in a different way. Obliviousness has to be granted the positive function 
          of a "sous-venir". "In oblivion, the past "sous-vient" [appears] to 
          man, as his future taking the form of his past" (KLOSSOWSKI, 1963, pp. 
          194-195). Oblivion is essential to history as well to the individual. 
          History is only made of acts and creations arising from oblivion (LEUTRAT, 
          1986).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">The images emerging from the "m&eacute;moire involontaire" 
        are emerging from oblivion. The kind of memory valued by Benjamin as related 
        to aura and art implies oblivion as integral to memory. It does not fit 
        the conservatory obsession of the 'recollection', a word which refers 
        to a specific relation to memory but which also refers to the religious 
        contemplation of artworks related to Benjamin's first definition of aura. 
        On the contrary, the capacity of images emerging from the past of anticipating 
        future is embodied in artworks. The museum must revive this germinative 
        power of artworks by arousing the specific approach emphasized by Benjamin: 
        In "The History of Art is a History of prophecies". Godard tries to convey 
        with <i>Passion</i> an artistic approach of History as opposed to History 
        of cinema based on an industrial approach of documentary memory. This 
        reductionist archivist method is the one that Benjamin associated with 
        the volitional discursive memory wrought by the techniques of reproduction. 
        But Godard shows that with this technique of reproduction, cinema, it 
        is possible to develop another kind of History than can be <i>told</i>. 
        Like Benjamin, Godard points out the fundamental value of storytelling 
        as opposed to the reification of time in terms of information. But the 
        storytelling is valued by Benjamin because its transmission is related 
        to experience:</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">Experience which is passed on from mouth to mouth 
          is the source from which all storytellers have drawn./.../The storytelling 
          /.../is itself an artisan form of communication, as it were. It does 
          not aim to convey the pure essence of the thing, like information or 
          a report. It sinks the thing into the life of the storyteller, in order 
          to bring it out of him again<i> </i>(BENJAMIN, 1936b, pp. 84-91).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">In storytelling, memory is embodied in the storyteller 
        as experience. Memory coexists with the human agent of its transmission. 
        This kind of consubstantiality resembles the specific relation between 
        the content of an artwork and its form that is not separable from its 
        texture:</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">In the artwork content and form are one: meaning. 
          Meaning is the outcome of experience (BENJAMIN, 1928).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">I have pointed out (RIEUSSET-LEMARIE, 1999) that 
        the fundamental threat in the age of multimedia reproduction consists 
        in trying to separate content and form, message and media, even in those 
        things as artworks that can't bare this artificial dissociation. A work 
        is conceived by multimedia cultural industries as a mere message that 
        can be indifferently reproduced on various media. But some artists, like 
        Godard, affect reluctance to this artificial dissociation.</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">Godard is thus planning a "true history of cinema", 
          a history "made of pictures and sounds, not of illustrated texts" (GODARD, 
          1980, p. 15). A true history of cinema, that is, will be, an audio-visual 
          one, not a written one. Its medium must be the same as its object (LEUTRAT, 
          1986).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">The historical mission of the dissemination of cultural 
        heritage in art museums can achieve the dissemination of memory as experience, 
        but this aim requires to convey the kind of memory which is specific to 
        artworks: its medium must be the same as its object. But does all that 
        mean that a museum of cinema must be a movie and that a Web Museum must 
        be displayed as a digital artwork? The tendency of conceiving an exhibition 
        as a work and not only as the dissemination of information is interesting. 
        This is a possible way, but there are other ways. The point is to convey 
        the trace of the experience that was embodied in artworks, even if these 
        artworks were created with other media. It is a difficult challenge. You 
        can't pretend to achieve the reconstitution of past artworks artificially 
        dissociated from their media. But the point is the dissemination of the 
        traces of an artwork in so far as these latter involved the transmission 
        of time as a discontinuum. You can revive the image of an artwork by creating 
        a new image with another media:</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">The trace lies for Godard in the relationship 
          between the image to be made and the image already made, that of the 
          past. It is a fleeting moment, a spatialized fragment which cannot be 
          situated. It belongs to the order of forthcoming things (LEUTRAT, 1986).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">But the ability of creating with traces implies 
        the prerequisite conditions which determine the peculiar status of the 
        trace:</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">The trace is indissociable from memory and oblivion. 
          In its traditional meaning, it is the sign of something else, derived 
          from an original presence. However, recent considerations on the notion 
          of trace, especially those of Jacques Derrida, assert the contrary : 
          the notion of trace would entail the destroying of any idea or origin. 
          Effacement would be inherent in the trace, so that a trace that would 
          be ineffaceable would no longer be a trace (LEUTRAT, 1986).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">If Benjamin pointed out the specific problems encountered 
        by memory in the age of the mechanical reproduction, Web Museum would 
        encounter a new obstacle in the age of digital reproduction. Sawad Brooks 
        emphasized the "erasure of erasure" in digital media:</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">the deposit (left as the drawn mark) is a visible 
          substitute when touch alone will not leave a significant mark./.../ 
          the meaning of erasure of digital records differs from the meanings 
          erasure holds in relation to analog media. In analog media, when something 
          is erased, it is often possible to sense the mark left by erasure. /.../Erasure 
          leaves its own traces, it is writing or drawing. It is a wiping clean 
          which puts forth an order with the possibility of decipherment. How 
          do we decipher the static of digital erasure? (BROOKS, 1998a)</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">Digital media lacks the incision left by the drawing 
        on traditional media. Things are present or absent on electronic media, 
        but it is difficult to find something resembling a trace. Effacement seams 
        irreversible. It does not seem to leave the trace of erasure (we must 
        notice, however, that after a problem in saving a text, you can sometimes 
        find strange geometric figures that are the traces, not so much of the 
        lost words, but of their erasure). Sawad Brooks tried to resist the resistance 
        of digital tools for erasure:</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">I make drawing interfaces to draw upon the erasure 
          of erasure in the realm of the digital<i> </i>(BROOKS, 1998a).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">'Erasure of erasure' is not ineffaceability but 
        it makes the decipherment of traces more complex. In order to revive the 
        possibility of being deciphered, interpolation may be helpful. The image 
        created is not the same one which was present before the erasure, but 
        it revives the possibility of the decipherment of a trace which has disappeared 
        after the erasure of the erasure. In this case, the possibility of reviving 
        erasure in digital media depends on the creation of an artwork. Sawad 
        Brooks have created another artwork which emphasizes the possibility of 
        deciphering memory as experience in the age of digital media: 'DissemiNET':</span></p>

        <p><span class="normal">DissemiNET /.../ provides spaces (lacunae) for 
          people to recall and recollect, gathering there to re-tell stories about 
          their own experiences with displacement and dispersal (BROOKS, 1998b).</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">The aesthetics of dissemination convey memory as 
        experience. The interesting point is that these kinds of artworks are 
        created thanks to digital techniques. The net becomes integral part of 
        the artwork. Web museums and Web Galleries are not only displaying reproductions. 
        Internet does not only play the role of a space dedicated to exhibits. 
        Sometimes the web of the net is the texture of the artwork. Collaborative 
        artworks are not only reproduced or exhibited on the Net. In Web Art (http://gallery.bostobcyberarts.org/webgallery.html), 
        the visitor has the power to make the artwork appear or <i>disappear</i>; 
        in the OFFLINE PROJECT (http://www.massart.edu/~dmoser/yuk/objective.html), 
        the visitors are invited '<i>to participate in this process of erasure</i>'. 
        Web museums will overcome the difficulty encountered by the techniques 
        of reproduction to disseminate memory as experience by the displaying 
        of virtual artworks for which the web is not a media disconnected from 
        the content of the artwork, but its woven interactive texture.</span></p>
