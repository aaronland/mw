      <blockquote> 
	<p class="small">Taking courses on the Internet is an increasingly popular 
	  way for teachers to develop new skills and knowledge. Planning and teaching 
	  these courses involves new ways for museums and other cultural organizations 
	  to interact with their constituencies. In Spring 1999, the Getty Education 
	  Institute (GEI) offered <i>Artworlds Online</i>, an online professional 
	  development course focused on Los Angeles-centered lesson plans and 
	  activities that it had developed. The course is archived online at <a href="http://www.artsednet.getty.edu/ArtsEdNet/Resources/Worlds/Prof/Artworlds/index.html">http://www.artsednet.getty.edu/ArtsEdNet/Resources/Worlds/Prof/Artworlds/index.html</a>.The 
	  GEI structured the lessons to use the simplest possible technology given 
	  teachers' resources and capabilities on the Web. This paper presents 
	  lessons learned, assessment of the course evaluation and issues raised 
	  in the development and implementation of the course.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="heading"><b>What Was <i>Artworlds Online</i>?</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In Spring 1999, the Getty Education Institute (GEI) 
	offered <i>Artworlds Online</i>, an online professional development course 
	focused on Los Angeles-centered lesson plans and activities that it had 
	developed. The course is archived online at <a href="http://www.artsednet.getty.edu/ArtsEdNet/Resources/Worlds/Prof/Artworlds/index.html">http://www.artsednet.getty.edu/ArtsEdNet/Resources/Worlds/Prof/Artworlds/index.htm</a>l.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The mission of the GEI--which had been one of the 
	programs of the J. Paul Getty Trust until June 1999, when it ceased operation--was 
	to improve the quality and status of art education in the nation's schools. 
	From the GEI's founding in 1982, professional development programs for 
	teachers already in the classroom had been developed and offered. The 
	programs often included a component in which museums in the community 
	were part of consortium that offered professional development, and the 
	programs' multifaceted approach to art education included a strong focus 
	on original works of art.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Most of the GEI's professional development programs 
	were regional in focus and were not available to a national audience. 
	As part of a institute-wide research and development effort to explore 
	creation of programs on a national level, the GEI's team for <A HREF="http://www.artsednet.getty.edu/">ArtsEdNet</A>, 
	its web site, began to develop online professional development programs. 
	The GEI's professional development programs were documented in Wilson, 
	1997.)</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><i>Artworlds Online</i> was the first (and last) 
	of these online programs. By completing the 12-week course, participants 
	would receive three salary credits (also known as continuing education 
	credits) from Arizona State University. (Salary credits are points that 
	teachers can use to demonstrate their continuing education. School districts 
	have different rules regarding salary credits, and participants in <i>Artworlds 
	Online</i> needed to establish ahead of time whether their school district 
	would accept the salary credits. These credits are not the same as graduate 
	credits, which can also be offered for online professional development.)</span></p>
      <p class="heading">Objectives (Institutional)</p>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">The GEI's goals for <i>Artworlds 
	Online</i> were to </span></span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">raise the awareness of arts 
	  teachers, museum educators, and others of the curriculum materials developed 
	  for ArtsEdNet</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">expand the audience for 
	  ArtsEdNet</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">encourage the existing ArtsEdNet 
	  and GEI audiences to become more comfortable with the Internet</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">build a community and audience 
	  for future online professional development programs</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">develop an understanding 
	  of the challenges and costs involved in delivering professional development 
	  programs online</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">research the feasibility 
	  of online professional development programs</span></span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">The ArtsEdNet team hoped in 
	the long run to develop online courses that would be easily replicated 
	and self-sustaining.</span></span></p>
      <p class="heading">Evolution</p>
      <p><span class="normal">Although <i>Artworlds Online</i> was the first full-scale 
	professional development program that ArtsEdNet had offered online, it 
	was not the GEI's first online course. It had been proceeded by a course 
	called <i>Artworlds Professional Development</i> offered in Summer 1998 
	that gave one graduate credit at Arizona State University. It was not 
	widely marketed, and none of its five participants were awarded the graduate 
	credit point. However, the ArtsEdNet team did learn many valuable lessons 
	through this course on information architecture for courses, mentoring 
	of participants needed, and the technology demands on participants.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">ArtsEdNet's online professional development programs 
	had been preceded by a number of moderated listserve discussions on various 
	artists or issues in art education. These had begun shortly after ArtsEdNet 
	went online in 1995. The ArtsEdNet listserve proved immensely popular 
	immediately with art teachers and teachers who include the arts in their 
	teaching. The discussion mostly consisted of tips on using art materials 
	and classroom management. The GEI had a broader approach to art education 
	that includedóin addition to artwork created by studentsóexploration of 
	the work of artists from global cultures, understanding issues in art 
	(aesthetics), and reading and writing about art (art history and criticism). 
	</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">To broaden the discussion on the listserve, the 
	ArtsEdNet team created question and answer sessions with artists and with 
	educators that complemented material on the web site. These discussions 
	included interactions with and about:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">artist Sandy Skoglund</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">educator and author Graeme Chalmers on multicultural 
	  education (<i>Celebrating Pluralism</i>)</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">sculptor Jesus Moroles</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">educator Mary Erickson on <i>Our Place in the 
	  World</i>, a curriculum approach she developed</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">artist John Biggers</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">art and ecology</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">philosophers Marcia Eaton and Ronald Moore</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Through these discussions, the ArtsEdNet team developed 
	an awareness of issues that concerned teachers, how to present information 
	online in a way that would not be overwhelming to them, and some of the 
	nuts and bolts concerns that arise from the use of e-mail and Web technology.</span></p>
      <p class="heading">Development</p>
      <p><span class="normal">Based on these experiences, the ArtsEdNet team began 
	to develop <i>Artworlds Online</i> in the fall of 1998 for presentation 
	in the spring on 1999. The team for this projected consisted of:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Dr. Candy Borland, ArtsEdNet project director </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Dr. Mary Erickson, Arizona State University, curriculum 
	development and online mentor (consultant)</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Dr. Faith Clover, Arizona State University, curriculum 
	development and online mentor (consultant)</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Kathy Talley-Jones, project manager (consultant)</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Adrienne Lee, course coordinator (GEI staff)</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Marlin Mowatt, ArtsEdNet webmaster (GEI staff)</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The content for <i>Artworlds Online</i> was based 
	on a series of curriculum units called Worlds of Art that had been developed 
	in conjunction with the Getty Information Institute's LA Culture Net initiative. 
	The 12-week course was developed by Drs. Erickson and Clover. Great care 
	was taken to ensure that participants were challenged but not overwhelmed 
	by the course, and it was reduced in size and scope a number of times.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The ArtsEdNet staff considered a number of online 
	course software providers as well as institutions to offer salary or graduate 
	credit. It was decided to use the most simple system possible, based on 
	experience with the previous course and the ArtsEdNet listserve. It was 
	the staff's observation that most of its audience had a fairly low familiarity 
	and fluency with software and the Internet. Technical issues dominated 
	the first course and consumed much of the time of the participants and 
	the mentors. Therefore, <i>Artworlds Online</i> consisted of:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">lesson instructions on the ArtsEdNet web site</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">a listserve open only to participants</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">There was no threaded discussion and none of the 
	other bells and whistles used in online courses offered by universities 
	and other providers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Salary credit was offered through Arizona State 
	University because of Dr. Erickson and Clover's relationships with the 
	online course staff there. Participants registered and paid through Arizona 
	State University. The course fee was $99 (most similar online courses 
	cost around $400), and in the evaluation participants' expressed willingness 
	to pay that much for the course. The fee was kept low to mitigate any 
	inconvenience to participants for this shakedown cruise, and students 
	were aware that they were part of a research and development effort.</span></p>
      <p class="heading">Content</p>
      <p><i><span class="normal">Artworlds Online</span></i><span class="normal"> 
	was based on the Worlds of Art curriculum materials. Worlds of Art (<a href="http://www.artsednet.getty.edu/ArtsEdNet/Resources/Worlds/index.html">http://www.artsednet.getty.edu/ArtsEdNet/Resources/Worlds/index.html</a>) 
	is a collection of curriculum resources and professional development activities 
	designed specifically to make use of the cultural resources and heritage 
	of Los Angeles. It formed a self-contained module within ArtsEdNet that 
	was also accessible from the Getty Information Instituteís LA Culture 
	Net.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Through Worlds of Art, the GEI encouraged teachers 
	and students to understand the concepts of <i>artworld</i> and <i>culture</i> 
	and explore the art and culture of some of Los Angelesís multicultural 
	communities.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The Internet, with its power to link communities 
	and allow groups to speak in their own voices, had been underutilized 
	by teachers in their exploration and understanding of their local cultural 
	heritage. Through Worlds of Art, teachers gained not only a sense of their 
	own physical surroundings, but a thorough knowledge of how the Internet 
	can be used to enrich and add substance to their art instruction.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Worlds of Art used a discipline-based approach to 
	art education; the lessons were interdisciplinary, thematic, and inquiry 
	based. In addition to increasing student understanding of culture and 
	artworlds through its lesson plans, Worlds of Art also provided innovative 
	and interactive professional development opportunities with a graduate 
	credit option for teachers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">There was some concern that the art of Los Angeles 
	might be too parochial for a national audience (an international audience, 
	as it turned out), but most of the participants had a strong interest 
	in the multicultural focus of the artwork discussed. These works included:</span></p>

      <p class="normal">Part of the course consisted of explorations by participants 
	of cultural web sites, particularly those focused on the artworlds concerned 
	in the Worlds of Art curriculum units. Their explorations were focused 
	by specific questions that they reported on by e-mail to the group. The 
	ArtsEdNet team hoped that discussions of related issues would arise spontaneously. 
	Because there were up to 64 participants, however, the volume of e-mail 
	that each participant received was enormous, and students felt constrained 
	by the amount of communication involved.</p>
      <i> </i> 
      <p class="heading">Objectives (Content)</p>
      <p><span class="normal">The following were the stated objectives for participants' 
	learning through <i>Artworlds Online</i>:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">introduce teachers to a series of lessons they 
	  can use to help their students better understand art and artworlds </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">identify and discuss interest groups of which 
	  they are members and describe their own artworld experience </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">discuss how they might introduce students to 
	  an artworld as a culture within a culture </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">facilitate discussion among participating teachers 
	  about how to introduce artworlds to their students </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">guide teachers in identifying Internet resources 
	  they can use to help their students better understand art and artworlds 
	  </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal"> More specifically, participants will:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">develop a working definition of what artworlds 
	  are </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">analyze important people, places, activities, 
	  and ideas associated with several distinct, though sometimes overlapping, 
	  artworlds (Mexican American and African American) in the United States 
	  </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">use the Internet to explore a wide range of artworlds 
	  </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">identify ways to lead students in using the Internet 
	  as a source of information about art and artworlds </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">determine the credibility of Web sites they are 
	  considering introducing to their students </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">analyze the educational potential of Web sites 
	  for classroom use </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">compare their own ideas about how to use an artworld 
	  Web site in teaching with how other teachers might use the same Web 
	  site </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">consider cautions they might want to think about 
	  when introducing their students to artworks made in diverse artworlds 
	  </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">analyze how their understanding of their own 
	  artworld may have evolved as they participated in Artworlds Online</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading"><b>Marketing</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The GEI used several methods for getting the word 
	out about <i>Artworlds Online</i>:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><SPAN CLASS="caption"><SPAN CLASS="normal"><SPAN CLASS="caption">ArtsEdNet 
	listserve (26 participants)</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></span></p>
      <p><SPAN CLASS="caption"><SPAN CLASS="normal"><SPAN CLASS="caption"><span class="normal"><i>ArtsEdNet 
	Offline</i> (GEI newsletter; 15 participants)</span></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN CLASS="caption"><SPAN CLASS="normal"><SPAN CLASS="caption"><span class="normal">word 
	of mouth or unknown source (9 participants)</span></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN CLASS="caption"><SPAN CLASS="normal"><SPAN CLASS="caption"><span class="normal"><i>NAEA 
	News</i> quarter-page ad (8 participants)</span></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN CLASS="caption"><SPAN CLASS="normal"><SPAN CLASS="caption"><span class="normal">Museum-Ed 
	listserve (4 participants)</span></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN CLASS="caption"><SPAN CLASS="normal"><SPAN CLASS="caption"><span class="normal"><i>School 
	Arts</i> quarter-page ad (2 participants)</span></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></p>
      <p><span class="normal">A total of 64 participants enrolled in the course, 
	52 of whom completed the course (evidently a very low attrition rate for 
	an online course). That nearly half of the participants enrolled based 
	on information through focused listserves suggests this as an attractive 
	and inexpensive means of marketing online courses. (Listserves are free 
	to join, of course, but there may be staff or consultant time used to 
	join and post messages so that they are welcomed and not perceived as 
	spam.)</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Audience</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The target audience for <i>Artworlds Online</i> 
	was educators, specifically art K-12 art specialists or classroom teachers 
	using the arts in their teaching. The participants for Artworlds Online 
	were for the most part art or music teachers (34). The balance were general 
	classroom teachers (10) or English or social studies teachers (10), museum 
	educators (6), school administrators (2), and graduate students in education 
	(2). Participants came from 25 states and five countries (Canada, Great 
	Britain, Japan, New Zealand, and Thailand).</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Participants accessed the course in a number of 
	ways:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"> 
	<UL>
	  <LI> from home (83%)</LI>
	</UL>
	</span><P></p>
      <p><span class="normal"> 
	<UL>
	  <LI>n the classroom (13%)</LI>
	</UL>
	</span><P></p>
      <p><span class="normal"> 
	<UL>
	  <LI>at work (museum educators and administrators; 13%)</LI>
	</UL>
	</span><P></p>
      <p><span class="normal"> 
	<UL>
	  <LI>school media lab (8%)</LI>
	</UL>
	</span><P></p>
      <p><span class="normal">
	<UL>
	  <LI>school or public library (4%)</LI>
	</UL>
	</span><P></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Of the participants, 63% used a PC, 37% used a Macintosh. 
	None used Web TV or any other type of web access.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This was the first online course for all participants 
	but one. Most (100%) said they would be interested in further online courses 
	offered by the GEI.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Most of those who replied to the query had access 
	via a 56K modem (50%), 28.8 (21%), T1 (4%), and ISDN (4%). The balance 
	(21%) did not know what kind of modem connection they had. More than halfóin 
	spring 1999óhad been using the Internet less than a year. 40% had an Internet 
	connection in their classroom.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The ArtsEdNet staff had set 65 as the cutoff for 
	enrollment, not expecting to come anywhere near this. When 64 people had 
	signed up, there was some discussion that they should be divided according 
	to interest groups with Dr. Erickson mentoring one group and Dr. Clover 
	the other. The participants themselves did not want to divide the group 
	up, however.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Participants' Expectations</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Most of the participants found the course to be 
	about as difficult as expected. The course developers put a great deal 
	of effort in balancing the numbers of hours that students spent online 
	and in completing assignmentsófrom four to six hours per week. Some took 
	much moreóup to 36 hours a week!--partly because of technical problems 
	that they had (losing files, bookmarks, inability to use e-mail and browser 
	programs) or because they had slow modem speeds. 96% said that the level 
	of effort was worth the outcome.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In a survey following the completion of the course, 
	participants gave the following feedback:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">most would have preferred graduate credits to 
	  salary (continuing education) credits</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">many liked the ability to participate asynchronously; 
	  however, a number missed face to face communication</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">most felt the class size (64 initially) was too 
	  large, even with two instructors</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">most would have preferred more interaction with 
	  fellow participants</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">some became much more familiar with the Internet 
	  as a result; "colleagues and my principal are impressed"</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Topics the participants would like to see in the 
	future included:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">how to deal with multicultural issues / cultural 
	  sensitivity</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">inquiry-based teaching with museum objects</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">integrating art into the social studies curriculum</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">literacy and art</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">Webquests</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">student exchange programs</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">single-topic focus on one culture, for example, 
	  Navajo art</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">incorporating national standards in a diverse 
	  classroom</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">research topics in art education</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">how to develop lesson plans</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">teaching kids to be better citizens through art</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading"><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Cost and Time Needed</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As might be expected, developing and running <i>Artworlds 
	Online</i> was expensive. Developing the course required:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">150 hours total of course development time for 
	  two developers for 12 weeks' worth of lessons, including drafting and 
	  revising the online curriculum</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">75 hours of project management time: this included 
	  coordination between the developers and the GEI, reviewing the course 
	  and offering feedback and a reality check, preparing the material for 
	  the Web and reviewing implementation, drafting ad copy, contacting listserves, 
	  drafting e-mail messages to participants, making arrangements with ASU 
	  to administer the course and setting up systems with the course coordinator; 
	  monitor the course in process</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">40 hours of web implementation</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">100 hours of course coordinator time, including 
	  assisting with registration, resolving issues with participants, tracking 
	  participating weekly, sending follow-up e-mails to laggards, preparing 
	  statistics, etc.</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">40 hours each over 12 weeks for the course mentors 
	  (Drs. Erickson and Clover)</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The course mentors did not reply to specific e-mails 
	on a daily basis but each wrote one e-mail a week that gathered issues 
	and comments that had come up during the week. While this minimized their 
	need to interact with participantsóalthough they had a lot of e-mail to 
	read every weekósome participants wished for more personalized interaction 
	with the instructors.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">All but the web implementation and course coordination 
	were in consultation to the GEI. Because regular e-mail, browser, and 
	web technology was used, time needed for programming was kept to a minimum. 
	None of the technology proved problematic except to participants who were 
	utter novices to the web and to computers. The course took about six months 
	to develop and implement.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It was the hope of those involved that refinements 
	could be made to the <i>Artworlds Online</i> course and that it could 
	be offered in the future with much less overhead and perhaps break even 
	or make a profit. However, this did not happen because of a change in 
	focus for the Getty Trust web programs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In addition to learning that running an online course 
	is an expensive and time-consuming process, the ArtsEdNet team also learned 
	that:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">participant groups should be much smaller if 
	  community-building is to occur</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">participants wanted a greater focus on Internet 
	  skills and multicultural teaching than was offered</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">the course should include less content</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">many participants (at least art teachers) would 
	  like more personalized contact or even face-to-face contact</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">some participants noted that they heard more 
	  from fellow students online than in most classes</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">the concept of "artworld" was too specific and 
	  narrow and that participants were more interested in learning about 
	  using and understanding artwork from other cultures</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">make use of real-time chat features offered by 
	  Yahoo and One List for "clubs" or other groups</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading"><b>Recommendations</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">If museums or other educational institutions other 
	than universities or school systems that have a curriculum infrastructure 
	wish to pursue offering courses online, the following suggestions can 
	be kept in mind:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">use existing curricula as a basis for online 
	  courses to save on costs of course development</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">work in conjunction with other organizations 
	  or institutions wishing to offer online coursesóseveral museums in a 
	  consortium for example, or in collaboration with a school district, 
	  college, or university</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">have a compelling reason to reach beyond a local 
	  audience</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">online image quality may be too poor to offer 
	  meaningful learning</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">K-12 home schoolers are probably a growing and 
	  important audience</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">offer a module that allows participants to experience 
	  the museum's original artifacts or artworks</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">be closely tied to national and local educational 
	  standards and curriculum frameworks</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">there should be a distinct advantage to asynchronous 
	  communication</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">use the simplest technology possible or be prepared 
	  to offer online assistance</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">be realistic about the amount of time that will 
	  be involved</span></li>
      </ul>
