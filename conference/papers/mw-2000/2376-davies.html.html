      <p class="heading"><b>Creating Heritage Content for the Web</b></p>
      <p class="author"><b>Adriana A. Davies, Heritage Community Foundation, Canada</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="small">The presentation acknowledges the importance of the internet 
          as a tool for communicating information held in the collections of heritage 
          institutions and organizations (broadly defined). It will address: content 
          development, funding, technical challenges and opportunities. The issue 
          of content development is of primary importance for the heritage sector. 
          While for other content providers, individuality is almost a prerequisite, 
          in the area of the representation of public history and heritage, there 
          are a number of constraints </p>
        <p class="small">Heritage institutions (museums, archives, historic sites, 
          etc.) and organizations (historical societies, genealogical societies, 
          ethnocultural societies, etc.) are a part of the non-profit sector and 
          also make extensive use of volunteers. Thus, an under-resourced sector 
          is being called upon to make use of a new technology without the necessary 
          resources, fiscal or human to do so. Is doing things on a shoe-string 
          possible? How can we get heritage content on the web.?:</p>
        <p class="small">While many roadblocks can be identified, it would be 
          foolhardy for the sector to avoid getting started. Much can be accomplished 
          using the traditional techniques that are hallmarks of the sector.</p>
      </blockquote>
     
        <p class="normal"><b>Introduction</b> </p>
        <blockquote>  <p class="normal">Eventually computers will be omnipresent, worn and used 
          as companions and assistants. Our relationship to information will thus 
          change because such VPCs (Very Personal Computers) will allow us instant 
          access to all publicly available information in the world (Worzel 99).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="normal">Any heritage institution or organization that regards 
        a presence on the web as discretionary, at this point in time, is hiding 
        its head in the sand. A great deal of evidence exists about the value 
        of the internet as both a communications and educational tool. The case 
        does not have to be made here. The issues, rather, are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">how heritage content gets online</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">who does it and for what purpose</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">how is content determined </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">technical standardsówho develops, monitors and 
          enforces them</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">who pays for this and, finally,</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">what are the challenges, opportunities and pitfalls.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">These issues can be grouped under three general 
        headings: content, technology and money. The following paper discusses 
        them with reference to one project, Alberta Heritage Online, which I modestly 
        offer as a case study. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In 1999 as the Executive Director of the Alberta 
        Museums Association (trade name, Museums Alberta), the association of 
        the provinceís over 200 museums and their paid and unpaid workers, I applied 
        for and received a grant from the Canadian Millennium Partnership Program, 
        a federal funding initiative. The project, Alberta Heritage Online, was 
        a proposal to develop a provincial (that is, state) heritage website. 
        The site overview, as set out in the grant application, was very ambitious 
        as befitted a Government of Canada millennium project. Alberta Heritage 
        Online was billed as Albertaís new, imaginative and educational heritage 
        website, serving as the gateway to the rich heritage resources of the 
        province. It sets out to:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">provide an educational resource for the provinceís 
          school children</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">make the provinceís heritage resources available 
          to local, provincial, national and international visitors</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">create opportunities for Albertaís heritage organizations 
          and groups to realize an individual as well as a &quot;hot- linked&quot; 
          presence on the worldwide web</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">serve as a pilot for the development of metada 
          for educational sites on the web.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The application outlined a process for creating 
	the site involving a number of stakeholders. The first setback, albeit 
	minor was that we were awarded substantially less than we asked for $67,750 
	(instead of a full $100,000). </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In the meantime, a new entity was born, the Heritage 
        Community Foundation, a Trust with educational objects with the following 
        purposes:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Mandate:&#9;Linking people with heritage.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Mission:&#9;Bringing heritage to the mainstream</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Vision:&#9;Heritage is valued by everyone.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The Alberta Heritage Online project became my responsibility 
        as the <i>new</i> Executive Director of the <i>new</i> Heritage Community 
        Foundation, with its broadly populist, educational objects. The Trustees 
        agreed that the Foundation would design and implement a range of initiatives 
        to help build knowledge of our heritage involving:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">heritage institutions and organizations </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">government agencies</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">like organizations, whether cultural, educational 
          or social service </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">public- and private-sector funders </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading"><b>Content development</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It is a truism that heritage institutions and organizations 
        have within them large quantities of information, which is potential content 
        for the web. The issue of how this content gets to the web has been the 
        concern of not only individual museums and historic sites but also government 
        agencies, museum IT interest groups, corporations, foundations and others. 
        The issue is a complicated one, as we know, not only for the usual reasons 
        of ownership of intellectual property but also because of the public nature 
        of many heritage facilities and their public trust mandates, which are 
        sometimes contained in legislation. Thus, while for other content providers 
        for the web, individuality is almost a prerequisite, in the area of the 
        representation of public history and heritage, there are <i>collective 
        needs</i> and interests, which must be addressed. These include:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">The definition of responsibilities to the public 
          about the interpretation of &quot;their&quot; heritage as an aspect 
          of public trust </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">The issue of authority with respect to content 
          development which must be addressed and mediated based on the variety 
          of content providers and &quot;experts&quot; within the heritage field 
          and academe</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">The sheer size of the sector, its interdisciplinary 
          nature and issues around &quot;whose history or heritage&quot; is being 
          presented</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">The special needs of the educational sector, 
          an even larger component of the public sector, and its needs and constraints. 
          </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The awareness of these larger responsibilities guided 
        all of our deliberations in the development of the Alberta Heritage Online 
        website. I think that this is a common mind-set that all heritage workers 
        adopt and which colours their thinking. I think that it involves being 
        able to seeóthe &quot;bigger&quot; picture, the societal story as well 
        as the individual story, the individual as well as the collective identity. 
        As a colleague put it, a gateway site to heritage is, in effect, implying 
        a kind of Good Housekeeping Seal of approval. We would de facto be viewed 
        as an authority, if not, <i>the </i>authority and that responsibility 
        weighed heavily on us. I think that this is an essential difference between 
        heritage content providers and other web content providers. While I have 
        not used, as yet, the term ethics, I believe that the issues around public 
        trust also pertain to ethical considerations that frame the activities 
        of any individuals, institutions and organizations serving the public 
        good.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This issue also has ramifications when we consider 
        that numerous museums, archives, historical societies, heritage agencies 
        (governmental and nongovernmental), educational departments and agenciesóall 
        develop web content dealing with history and heritage. In terms of the 
        consumer, which is the most authoritative, inclusive. While it is imperative 
        for individual museums, historic sites, heritage organizations and agencies 
        to develop their own content, I believe that we must also develop those 
        sites that bring together content from a number of sources to provide 
        the public with a &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; approach to heritage. 
        Whether this is done through an entity such as the Heritage Community 
        Foundation, or government (for example, the Government of Canadaís proposed 
        Virtual Museum of Canada to be developed through the Canadian Heritage 
        Information Network), it must be done. The challenges are enormous but, 
        if we succeed only partially, we will be providing citizens and visitors 
        with a resource that links historical narrative to place, people, objects 
        and documentsóthe stuff of heritage! The capacity to hot-link to a range 
        of other sites, once they have been screened so that they meet agreed-upon 
        heritage standards (this is a key justification for the CHINís Canadian 
        Gateway to Learning project and the development of both metadata and content 
        standards), means that a &quot;gateway&quot; site need not be all-embracing. 
        It needs to provide baseline data but can &quot;layer&quot; content through 
        strategic hot links.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The &quot;brains&quot; behind content development 
        for Alberta Heritage Online have been Dr. Michael Payne, Provincial Historian 
        with the Cultural Facilities and Historical Resources Division, Alberta 
        Community Development, the Alberta government department with responsibilities 
        for the preservation, study and interpretation of heritage. He quickly 
        provided his support to the project and also became the Vice-Chair of 
        the Web Council, chaired by myself. I, basically, had the nerve to indicate 
        that I would Chair this group. I took on the work because I believed in 
        the project and felt that I was the model of the &quot;new&quot; knowledge 
        worker, that is, that I was a generalist who had worked in a number of 
        areas including the museum field, research and editing, and university 
        and technical colleges. Most relevant was my 22 years of work in the museum 
        field (13 years working as Executive Director of the Alberta Museums Association) 
        and four years work on the <i>Canadian Encyclopedia</i> as Editor of the 
        Science, Technology, Industry and Material Culture sections. What Michael 
        and I both brought to the project is a belief in the importance of doing 
        it, some content expertise as well as networks of individuals, both colleagues 
        and friends, who can advise and provide content expertise in determination 
        of &quot;articles&quot; for the site as well as being volunteer editors 
        and authors. The first rule of the heritage sector is that you exploit 
        mercilessly, preferably for free, content experts and institutions. After 
        all, public trust cuts two ways! Other members of the Web Council, identified 
        because I have had a strong working relationship with both and because 
        of their expertise, are Craig díArcy, Marketing Co-ordinator, and Ed Wiens, 
        Designer (and computer whiz), both with the Historic Sites Service, Alberta 
        Community Development. In the initial project implementation stages, I 
        did consult more widely with museum and archival community representatives. 
        But once, the project began, in June, 1999, the Web Council was Michael, 
        Craig, Ed and myself, each with responsibilities as follows:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Adriana Davies project management and co-ordination; 
	  liaison with funders, web developers, Young Canada Works, and CHIN; 
	  overall site editor</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Michael Payne historical content advisor including 
	  major themes, key events for timeline, etc.; historical content editor</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Craig díArcyómarketing/tourism content provider</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Ed Wiens design arbiter including technical specifications.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The final members of the Project Team were/are three 
        interns made available to us through the Government of Canadaís Youth 
        Employment Strategy to work on both our project and CHINís Canadian Gateway 
        to Learning project. They are:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Mohamad Omar El-Hajj, Technical Intern expert 
	  in programming languages</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Dulcie Meatheringham, International Intern material 
	  culture program graduate with expertise in html and web design</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Kim Palmer, International Intern history and 
	  material culture program graduate.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The International Interns began work on October 
        1 for a six-month term and the Technical Intern, officially began work 
        for a four-month term on November 1 but, unofficially, worked as a volunteer 
        for the month of October. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It was this small group, who on October 1, 1999, 
        began to address content issues, created the storyboard and then generated 
        the preliminary content for the site. We had, and still have, a problem 
        with language. After all, Michael and I are both academics; therefore, 
        we made use of our interns, trusting that because of their youth they 
        would be more &quot;in tune&quot; with common language. As well, they 
        researched curriculum (particularly Social Studies) to see what terminology 
        was in use. The following are the site content areas:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Places to Go<i> ñ the cultural tourism component

      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The first generation of content is up and we satisfied 
        a requirement of our Alberta Government partneróto get the site up for 
        December 5<sup>th</sup> when KSPS Public Television, Spokane, was doing 
        a feature on Albertaís heritage. Since the Alberta-Montana Heritage Partnership 
        had made available, without charge, the Alberta content of their <i>Discovery 
        Guide to Museums, Parks and Historic Sites</i>, as well as contributing 
        $10,000 towards the cost of making the <i>Guide</i> searchable, we felt 
        that it was important to honour their trust. The promotional material 
        for the website promises that it is &quot;authoritative, educational, 
        enjoyable, relevant, visually pleasing, ever changing and comprehensive.&quot; 
        I cannot say that we do all of thisóyou can be the judge of that, but 
        we are already facing the following challenges:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">continue to build content, as well as replace 
          stale-dated content in the magazine section</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">strengthen curriculum-based resource materials</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">create truly interactive youth content</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">develop a timeline for content upload and obtain 
          the resources, fiscal and human to do this.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">At the same time, we are facing the prospect of:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">internships coming to an end in the next two 
          months</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">finalizing the Content Guide and </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">developing the volunteer base for the Editorial 
          Board, Section and Thematic Editors, not just identifying people but 
          recruiting them and getting them functioning</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading"><b>Funding issues</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Heritage institutions (museums, archives, historic 
	sites, etc.) and organizations (historical societies, genealogical societies, 
	ethnocultural societies, etc.) are a part of the non-profit sector. This 
	means that many have been impacted by the cutbacks in government funding. 
	As well, many of the smallest facilities are totally volunteer-run. Thus, 
	an under-resourced sector is being called upon to make use of a new technology 
	without the necessary resources, fiscal or human to do so. This task would 
	be impossible if we did not have the vision for getting our content on 
	the web and the determination to do this. I guess, what the Alberta Heritage 
	Online project has demonstrated is that, if the vision is compelling and 
	services broad public needs, an initial funder can be found. In this case, 
	this was the Government of Canada through the Canadian Millennium Partnership 
	Program. The next funder to come onside was the Young Canada Works Program, 
	a Youth Employment Program aimed at giving graduates a taste of the work 
	force. This happened through CHINís Gateway to Learning project. CHIN 
	staff believed that our project would give them an opportunity to not 
	only assist them in the development of metastandards for heritage content 
	for the web, but would also give them a site to test against these standards.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">I then made use of all of my contacts to not only 
        obtain human resources and content expertise but also cash and in-kind 
        support. This ranges from the website developers, Canadiana Group Inc. 
        (a part of Pangaea Inc.) hosting the site for one year to all-kinds of 
        content support from Alberta Community Development. But the challenge 
        is to continue to go after government grants programs (including internship 
        programs), to seek corporate support through sponsorships and, ultimately, 
        the endorsement of the education ministry as web content builds a closer 
        and closer fit with curriculum. Applying for grants is a complicated, 
        time consuming process; implementing and reporting to funders is even 
        more complicated. At present, I have built web costs into four grant applications 
        and have begun to woo corporate sponsors. Sometimes, wearing multiple 
        hats is an uncomfortable exercise. Our web developers deal routinely with 
        business and their Web Charter, Strategic Plans and Content Guides all 
        speak of dedicated personnel and money. I have none of this support structure 
        and am having to rewrite them extensively around my constraints, which 
        are no core funding or support staff. For example, the Webmaster in the 
        Content Guide is a full-time position with both content and technical 
        powers and responsibilities. The content responsibilities I can take on 
        and share with my volunteer Web Council currently and, in the future, 
        with Section and Thematic Editors. The technical expertise I will have 
        to purchase, either through the website developers (which will be expensive) 
        or through ad hoc contracts with individuals, like our Technical Intern, 
        who are at the beginning of their careers and will do it for the love 
        rather than the money. There are no easy answers to any of this and one 
        is reliant on:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">the goodwill and content expertise of peers</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">the support, financial and technical, of government 
          agencies charged with responsibility for web development (such as CHIN)</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">the financial support of corporations and private 
          foundations with educational mandates.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Because of the need to manage the intricacies of 
        such elaborate collaborations (including partners, stakeholders, whatever), 
        one can feel like a juggler trying to keep a multiplicity of balls in 
        the air. But, at this time, I can see no alternative. The stakeholders 
        in the Alberta Heritage Online project are as follows:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">The principal funders are:</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="normal">Canadian Millennium Partnership Program </span></li>
          <li><span class="normal">Government of Canada Youth Employment Strategy 
            (Young Canada Works) </span></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Cash and in-kind support have been provided by 
          the following partners, stakeholders and sponsors:</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="normal">Alberta-Montana Heritage Partnership</span></li>
          <li><span class="normal">Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN)</span></li>
          <li><span class="normal">Canadiana Group Inc./Pangaea</span></li>
          <li><span class="normal">Cultural Facilities and Historical Resources 
            Division, Alberta Community Development</span></li>
          <li><span class="normal">Edmonton Community Lottery Board</span></li>
          <li><span class="normal"><i>Legacy</i> magazine</span></li>
          <li><span class="normal">Maclab Enterprises/Midwest Property Management</span></li>
          <li><span class="normal">Museums Alberta.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading"><b>Technical Challenges</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It is clear that, as a sector, the heritage field 
        comprises a preponderance of baby boomers, in positions of authority. 
        Computer literacy was not a requirement of their hiring nor a core responsibility 
        of their current job. I shall give myself as an example. While I commissioned 
        and edited the entries on computerization for the <i>Canadian Encyclopedia 
        </i>in the early 1980s, I was barely computer literate. I used a MAC at 
        home and at work all of my small staff had better computer skills than 
        I did. I never felt that this was an obstacle, although in the past year, 
        I have made a concerted effort to improve my skills. In any case, I rationalized 
        that I had the content expertise and project management skills to do the 
        work. I could obtain the technical expertise through contracting professionals 
        and through internships. But this is making a virtue of necessity and 
        only a short-term solution. As a sector we need to address the following 
        issues:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">The acquisition of skills for senior staff that 
          will be required to manage web development projects</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Obtaining the required staff with the competencies 
          at least at the junior level in professionally staffed facilities and 
          for volunteers in the volunteer-run ones to undertake such projects</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Determining what competencies need to be &quot;outsourcedí 
          and how to go about this including standards for the selection of web 
          developers</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Copyright and other legalities around intellectual 
          property</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Site development and maintenance including the 
          ongoing development of new content</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Researching the needs of various web audiences 
          (not just the educational sector) and addressing these needs.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The Alberta Heritage Online project immediately 
        digressed from the process proposed in the grant application, based on 
        the recommendations of the Steering Committee struck to guide the initial 
        development. Soon after project initiation, it was recognized that the 
        Steering Committee and other heritage partners could offer a wealth of 
        expertise in the area of content; however, a serious gap in technical/ 
        scientific expertise was quickly identified. This technology gap could 
        not be filled by staff at either at the Heritage Community Foundation 
        or Alberta Community Development, the provincial government partner department. 
        Consequently, rather than hiring a full-time Content Assistant with technical 
        expertise, as noted in the original proposal, made the decision to engage 
        a Website Design Company. The gains from doing this include: </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Expanded human resources; talent and energy as 
          well as a valuable non-heritage perspective</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Expanded technical resources</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Wider knowledge of the internet environment</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Greater cost effectiveness </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Capacity to assume multiple levels of responsibility 
          with respect to website development.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">A Request for Proposal was developed and mailed 
        out to 15 website design firms who responded<i>.</i> A selection committee, 
        drawn from the Steering Committee, reviewed all of the proposals and interviewed 
        seven short-listed candidates. Criteria for selection included:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">competence in the field of website development 
          and design</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">extensive experience and a substantial client 
          list</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">a cost-effective proposal</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">sensitivity to the budget constraints of non-profit/charitable 
          heritage community</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">ability to serve as a site sponsor.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">One of the first activities of the Project Team 
        (including the Web Council, Interns and Canadiana Group Inc.), was to 
        undertake a Strategic Planning exercise that would see continued content 
        development and site maintenance for the long-term. As a result of this 
        session, a Project Charter outlining a critical path for the project and 
        all deliverables was developed. Activitites undertaken include:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">three focus groups involving elementary, junior 
          high and high school students, teachers and parents</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">online research on existing educational/youth 
          sites to see what works and what doesnít.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">I can affirm that we could not possibly have got 
        the site up in the short time-frame without dedicated professionals providing 
        the technical expertise and support. However, I recently identified a 
        gap in the impressive array of talent at Canadiana Group Inc. and have 
        brought it to the attention of our project liaison. As an editor of number 
        of print works including books and magazines, I know the importance of 
        a rigorous editorial process as well as desk-top publishing capacity. 
        We were asked to deliver basic Word text with no formatting. This was 
        to be the responsibility of Canadiana. We fast-tracked the development 
        of text for the site and provided it in electronic format. Photographs 
        and slides went separately. In the translation of this material to the 
        site, I found that error was introduced as formatting was done. This meant 
        that every time I proofread on the screen, I had to make handwritten notes 
        on errors to be corrected/standardization, etc.; then transcribe these 
        into an email message. Technical staff at Canadiana would then make the 
        corrections but, inevitably, some were missed and some new errors were 
        introduced. With respect to the visuals (and our site is still poor in 
        this respect), some went adrift from their accompanying articles. As well, 
        the whole issue of copyright clearance is a major concern. I believe that, 
        in future phases, a more structured editorial process will help. Finally, 
        the capacity to do online editing inhouse will be a boon, since we have 
        had a training session and two of the three interns have the competencies 
        to do this. At least, until they leave. This, then, is the crux of the 
        matter. Content can be obtained free but for the maintenance of a successful 
        and dynamic site, a heritage institution or organization must have, the 
        services of an individual, say, the webmaster with technical expertise 
        to maintain and develop the site. This is a minimumóthe ideal to maintain 
        a site that is the equivalent of an encyclopedia is several dedicated 
        staff with the technical skills and sensitivity to the needs of heritage 
        content.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>The Opportunities</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Having described this complicated, time consuming 
        process (I found most evenings and weekends were spent on proofreading 
        at the screen), would I and the other Team members do it again. In short, 
        yes. As a writer, editor, ethnocultural historian and cultural manager, 
        I love the medium. I know that not everyone can access it as yet but trust 
        that down-the-road it will be as available as television. If we believe 
        passionately in the transformative power of experiencing our heritage, 
        how can we not use this new, democratic communications medium We are already 
        working on the next era of development for the Youth and Education, site 
        including video spots. I have already obtained some of the content for 
        the <i>Whatís New</i> section (from <i>Alberta Connections</i>, the Alberta 
        Community Development departmental magazine that showcases heritage). 
        I have already begun discussions with the department of education about 
        the development of curriculum resource materials, negotiated a deal with 
        the provinceís first radio broadcaster, and the deal making continues. 
        All of this gets the heritage message to more and more publics.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">While many roadblocks can be identified, the largest 
        being the lack of technical expertise within the sector, it would be foolhardy 
        for to avoid getting started. Much can be accomplished using the traditional 
        techniques that are hallmarks of the sector. These include:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Strategic public/private sector partnerships</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Use of grants, employment programsóthe range 
          of support mechanisms</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Effective use of professional networks within 
          the heritage sector</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Corporate sponsorships including branding to 
          obtain needed cash and inkind resources.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The next challenge is the assessment of our site 
        based on the criteria developed through CHINís Canadian Gateway to Learning 
        project. But, even if we are found wanting, we can correct and improve. 
        That is the beauty of the medium. If we had published 10,000 encyclopedias 
        with a typo or picture gone wrong, it would be a different matter.</span></p>
