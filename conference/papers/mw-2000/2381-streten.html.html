      <p class="heading"> <b>Honoured Guests - Towards a visitor centred web experience</b></p>
      <p class="author"><br>
        <b>Katie Streten, National Museum of Science &amp; Industry, UK</b></p>
      <p align="center" class="heading"><b>Abstract </b></p>
      <p align="CENTER"></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="small">Museum web sites have been structured in much the same 
          way as the Museum's own administrative structure. How can we move site 
          structure that focuses on visitor needs rather than our own internal 
          structure? This paper examines the combination of simple visitor evaluation 
          on gallery and via the web with a series of internal excercises to move 
          towards a new model for site structure. Concrete suggestions evaluation 
          and feedback will be examined. Reference will be made to evaluation 
          work done on the Science Museum web site through in gallery observations, 
          website evaluation and internal assessment.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="normal">A website is a work in progress. Unlike an interactive, 
        an exhibit or an exhibition, it offers an experience which can be changed 
        once completed, in fact an experience which the user expects to be changed. 
        It is dynamic and it is organic. This offers managers and evaluators of 
        websites an opportunity not often afforded to the developers of physical 
        exhibitions ñ to respond dynamically to the needs and expectations expressed 
        in visitor feedback and visitor studies.</p>
      <p><span class="normal">In addition to being organic, a website holds the 
        potential for interactivity. Interactivity is the foundation on which 
        the web has been built, springing, as it did, godlike out of the thigh 
        of the collaborative environment at CERN. Therefore, even when interactivity 
        extends only to a visitor feedback form, Internet culture is such that 
        museum website visitors are not shy in expressing their opinions and offering 
        suggestions where development or usage is concerned. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Finally, websites generate raw usage data. Web servers 
        can record not only the time of requests and the exact files requested, 
        but the countries, domains, in some cases even cities from which these 
        requests come, along with a variety of extra information. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It is evident therefore that the web is a medium 
        which offers a unique opportunity to involve users in its development. 
        It provides the means of collecting both subjective and objective data, 
        solicited or unsolicited and the possibility of responding to it both 
        summatively and formatively.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The flourishing of museum visitor studies over the 
        last decades of the twentieth century has reflected an ongoing commitment 
        to evolving a more visitor-centric experience of the museum environment. 
        Ames (1993) states the purpose of museum visitor studies clearly, &quot;Visitor 
        studiesÖ help attract larger, more diverse audiences by exploring the 
        positive and negative perceptions of museums among visitorsÖthereby enabling 
        museum staff to work on strengths and to correct weaknesses&quot;. My 
        contention in this paper is that museum website development teams must 
        take a more professional attitude towards website visitor evaluation in 
        order to ensure we make use of the resources available to us to receive 
        and assimilate the user experience to the benefit of our sites and thereby 
        of our visitors. They are honoured guests whose input should be highly 
        valued.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Brochures ñ a dirty word</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The current stage in the development of museum websites 
        still owes much to the early nature of the web. Early web development 
        can be likened to that of early television. In the early years of television 
        popular programming included among other things plays. Plays are a visual 
        medium, they tell a story and engage the viewer, broadcasting a play was 
        a good idea. However, these plays were actually broadcast as theatrical 
        plays using still camera shots and stage sets. The camera angles, the 
        visual effects, the music, the lighting and most importantly the removal 
        of the stage itself, those things we now understand to be the vocabulary 
        of television plays, had not been explored. What the viewer saw was a 
        stage broadcast with all camera shots taken from the front as if watching 
        the play at the theatre.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It is hardly surprising therefore that the earliest 
        websites, including museum websites, were based on a pre-existing form 
        of media, that being the brochure. The web originated as a pure information 
        publishing medium with its roots firmly in document sharing. Visually-enhanced, 
        physical, information documents are brochures. This makes the brochure 
        form a natural form to apply to the Web given the characteristics already 
        outlined. Adding to this the highly personal nature of the web, the possibility 
        it affords for document publishing with very little knowledge or experience, 
        the slightly gnostic atmosphere which surrounded its most enthusiastic 
        adherents and it becomes obvious that the first mass approach to the Web 
        would be to see it as a ëpersonal propoganda machineí. In using the word 
        ëpersonalí I mean to refer both to the individual character and the communal 
        personality of institutions and companies. In short early websites were 
        online brochures and including websites of museums.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It may seem that the nature of the information on 
        museum websites would preclude them from being classed in the same way 
        as other, information-light websites, after all the majority of museum 
        websites have always included information about our collections and many 
        used the web to tell stories about those collections from the earliest 
        stages. However, it is in the structuring of information that the brochure 
        formula was most evident. The Science Museumís own pages show this phenomenon 
        and its development.</span></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="screen1html.html" width="410" height="298"></p>
      <p class="caption"><b>Caption - Original Science Museum home page</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This image of the original home page of the Science 
        Museumís website from 1997 demonstrates the point clearly. We had thought 
        internally about our audiences and arranged our page to our liking. Therefore, 
        Exhibitions On-line is at the top because we were, justifiably, proud 
        of the work we had done there, exploring the possibilities of new technologies 
        in setting context and interpreting collections.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Exhibitions and collections are next. Despite the 
        fact that many visitors think of the two and, as we have discovered through 
        subsequent visitor studies, have different needs and interests in approaching 
        both, in the Museum they are developed by one department, therefore we 
        grouped them together. Further, we see the influence of an enthusiast 
        on the front page in the presence of the Science &amp; Society Picture 
        Library which, although it is an important arm of our commercial division, 
        is no more important than any of our other arms such as exhibition development 
        or press and therefore does not warrant a presence on the front page of 
        our site. Finally Visitor Information is the fourth item down. From research 
        at the Museum and from common sense we know that many visitors to our 
        site have come specifically to find visiting information, however, we 
        have not highlighted it at all. The final point to note is that there 
        is no way into the site other than by using the Museumís personal divisional 
        navigational preference. It is clear that the structure and navigational 
        options mark this site out clearly as a ëbrochureí site, one developed 
        with reference to the Museumís needs and not with reference to the visitorís 
        expectations.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Later developments moved Visitor information up 
        to the second spot on the navigation bar grouped the Science and Society 
        Picture Library with other commercial operations and split Exhibitions 
        and Collections. Further highlights were offered which enabled visitors 
        to find content not only through the divisions on the navigation bar but 
        also through exhibition highlights on the front page. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Yet we are still in a position of offering content 
        based on our own activities, until recently the Research pages of the 
        site were more focused on the research we do here than on the resources 
        we have for researchers. The education, entertainment and information 
        remit of museums remains and visitors expect and authoritative voice as 
        much in our virtual as our physical incarnations, but they equally expect 
        to find that information easily and clearly.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>What a difference three days made</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">ëMuseum visitor studies has always been a subject 
        with an agenda ñ to improve the lot of visitors.í (Bicknell and Farmelo, 
        1993). It is important to remember that the end aim of all museum visitor 
        studies is to ensure site development follows to improve the lot of the 
        visitor. This will obviously benefit the visitor ñ making content more 
        relevant, easier to find, more attractive ñ but in doing so it will also 
        benefit the museum. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The latest estimate of the number of domains on 
        the Internet (July 1999) is 56,218,000 (Internet Software Consortium <a href="http://www.isc.org/">http://www.isc.org/</a>). 
        This is up from 43,230,000 in January of the same year, an increase of 
        c.26%. As the number of domains continues to grow museumsí sites will 
        increasingly be judged against standards set by the commercial sector 
        in entertainment and education websites. The quality of information we 
        provide, the extent to which our web presence contributes to their remit 
        for education and access, ease of navigation, visual attractiveness and 
        so on will all become as essential virtually as they are physically. Indeed 
        governments have already introduced formalised performance indicators 
        relating distinctly to a museumís websites they are therefore already 
        having a direct impact on many museumsí funding. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Museums were amongst the first to recognise the 
        enormous potential of the information and educational opportunities which 
        the web can provide. In Britain the governmentís drive towards access 
        can be directly fulfilled through the immense reach of the web. Therefore 
        it is in our interests to provide a web service. However, it is important 
        to remember that the web is a self-selecting and fast moving medium. It 
        is not a ëpushí medium, it is a pull medium and our aim is not to get 
        visitors to visit the site and then leave, but for them to experience 
        the content we have prepared and to build community and bring their own 
        experiences to it. By listening to our visitors we strike more of balance 
        between serving our needs and serving the needs and of our visitors.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">There are three main forms of data which have been 
        used to date and can be used simply by researchers to conduct visitor 
        studies: server statistics, qualitative studies and unsolicited comment 
        and existing studies of museum visitors such as MORI reports and internal 
        knowledge of audiences and needs. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Statistical analysis</b></p>
      <p class="normal">One of the great benefits of the web is that content providers 
        can determine in a more accurate way than any other visual media, how 
        many people have seen their information ñ whether that be an advertisement, 
        a resource or a whole website. Statistical file analysis is used by almost 
        all websites and this provides a bedrock, an expectation, that the uses 
        of museums sites should be subject to scrutiny a priori. A good thing 
        in itself. Statistics packages can analyse the hits to our servers and 
        offer general indications on the popularity and use of our sites. This 
        is particularly true in analysing such areas as the most popular entry 
        and exit pages and paths through the site. By analysing which sections 
        of the sites are most used or most linked to museum web teams gain indications 
        as to the type of content most valued by the users. </p>
      <p class="normal">Good statistical packages are easy to come by and need 
        not be expensive, or even cost anything. Reliable statistics can be obtained 
        by packages such as Nedstat (<a href="http://uk.nedstat.net/">http://uk.nedstat.net/</a>) 
        which compiles data for sites with up to 10,000 visits per day or an eXTReMe 
        Tracking account (<a href="http://www.extreme-dm.com/tracking/?reg">http://www.extreme-dm.com/tracking/?reg</a>) 
        which does much the same thing. There are also packages which can be downloaded 
        and installed on your server or a remote machine (if you do not have access 
        to the server) such as Analog which is free for both Mac and PC (<a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/">http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/</a>). 
        For more graphic representations of data there are several packages for 
        which you can pay such as HitList (<a href="http://www.pwi.net/hitlist.html">http://www.pwi.net/hitlist.html</a>) 
        (which creates large database files and so should only be used on machines 
        with large memory and disk space) or Webtrends (<a href="http://www.webtrends.com/">http://www.webtrends.com</a>).</p>
      <p class="normal">An example of useful visitor information which can be 
        gathered from server files is the types of browsers being used by your 
        visitors. </p>

      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">The statistics for the month 
        of December 1999 clearly show th</span>at the majority of users on the 
        Science Museum website use Internet Explorer rather than Netscape Navigator. 
        This has implications for site development and interactivity. For instance 
        the Document Object Models in any javascripts used on the site should 
        be more biased towards the Internet Explorer model than the Netscape Navigator. 
        These kind of statistics are particularly relevant during redesign of 
        a site. Statistics on the level of browser by which I mean the version 
        number, are essential in dictating the level of functionality for a site. 
        If you set functionality to work with browsers of level 3.1 and above 
        and the majority of your audience use level 4 and above you are excluding 
        many elements of enhanced web browsing which may eventually annoy your 
        visitors and deter them from returning, whilst providing a high-level, 
        degrading experience according to browser version ensures that all visitors 
        receive some benefit appropriate to their own system. As museums with 
        access responsibilities it is not enough to simply discount users who 
        donít have the capability to view our sites. Server statistics provide 
        a valuable insight into browsing habits on site and should be a part of 
        any website visitor studies programme. </span> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Lies, damned liesÖ</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">There are however pitfalls. As Disraeli so wisely 
        said, ëThere are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statisticsí. 
        Whilst it tells us about visitor habits and gives us the raw data of their 
        location, time spent onsite and so on, analysing quantity of hits without 
        analysing the quality of user experiences is a mistake. There is no way 
        to know whether a site is confusing as visitors access the home page; 
        can visitors get straight to the information they need; is the reason 
        for the apparent popularity of one section of the site directly linked 
        to its place on the navigation bar rather than its content? </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">An example of the need for caution can be seen in 
        comparing the quantitative data for accesses to the /on-line directory 
        of the Science Museum site with qualitative data which resulted from a 
        museum visitor study conducted during June 1999. This directory houses 
        the majority of the Museumís interactive content on the website including 
        exhibitions, games and special content developed for children. The statistics 
        from the server files demonstrate the a large number of hits to this section 
        of the site over a period of 5 months. </span></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="Stretenfig2.JPG" width="374" height="249"></p>
      <p><span class="normal">From the graph above a number of assumptions can 
        be made:-</span></p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li><span class="normal">that the /on-line directory is providing popular 
          information </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">that visitors are aware of what content is held 
          in that directory through clear use of navigational text. </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">that the education directory is not providing 
          the right kind of information and that changing it to include more games 
          and exhibitions information will enable us to provide our visitors with 
          more of the information they want.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p><span class="normal">These are the assumptions which can be made from 
        the statistics taken in isolation. However, if we look at these statistics 
        in conjunction with a more qualitative analysis of the site we find out 
        far more about our visitorsí actual experience of the site.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Getting our hands dirty </b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In the summer of 1999 a Science Museum team conducted 
        an on gallery evaluation of the home page of the Science Museum website. 
        The study was carried out to evaluate the design and navigability of the 
        Museumís homepage. 112 visitors, selected at random were questioned over 
        3 days. 60% of respondents were male, 40% were female this split is representative 
        of the general UK internet audience of which 38% are female (Cyberatlas, 
        <a href="http://cyberatlas.internet.com/big_picture/geographics/article/032359112684100.html">http://cyberatlas.internet.com/big_picture/geographics/article/032359112684100.html</a>). 
        The UK audience is the largest for the Science Museum website. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Respondents were shown a print out of the Science 
        Museum home page and asked questions about it. As the aim was to test 
        the design and navigational text on the page a print out of the page was 
        used (see figure 2) in order to avoid creating an artefact of method. 
        Users were then asked a series of questions about the page, how they would 
        navigate around it, what they might expect to find in certain sections.</span></p>

      <p><span class="normal">It is evident from these responses that the title 
        which we had deduced to be so clear from the statistical evidence is actually 
        confusing. A better option might be to use the title ëVirtual Exhibitioní 
        as although it suggests virtual reality to 18% of respondents there is 
        far less confusion about the kind of content and the expectation of interactives 
        and games is fulfilled.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Using the same survey looking at the ëunpopularityí 
        of education pages it is apparent that in this case the navigational text 
        used is correct for the purpose. 55% of visitors expected to find information 
        for the education community (i.e. teachers and students), 10% felt that 
        there would be information for children on education, 4% felt that there 
        would be information for the further education community. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">These results can be further combined with those 
        from a survey conducted in a slightly different way, via the Internet, 
        in 1998 which focused on use of the education pages. The full report of 
        findings can be found at (<a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/eval/index.htm">http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/eval/index.htm</a>). 
        </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Science Museum website - education section survey</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This survey was conducted as follows. An invitation 
        was placed on the Science Museum web pages and volunteers emailed their 
        details to the Museum. These were responded to by Solomon Research with 
        a message offering a choice of completing a text questionnaire with the 
        e-mail or an on-line form located on the Solomon site.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"> Of 216 responses 49% came from those in education 
        and of those 46% had looked at the education section. A healthy proportion, 
        indicating that the section is speaking to the right audience. The study 
        also concluded that a fair proportion of the visitors in the education 
        section were looking for educational resources. The specificity of information 
        in the /education directory is the main reason why its hits are so much 
        lower than the /on-line directory. The information it provides is right, 
        the target audience is smaller and has a more specific agenda.</span></p>
      <p><b>Further benefits of getting your hands dirty</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Thus far I have demonstrated the importance and 
        usefulness of qualitative data to enable summative adaption of web pages 
        or web experiences in line with visitor needs. It is also useful for formative 
        approaches to new website content. Often studies done in oneís own museum 
        can be looked at in the context of other international studies. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Chadwick and Boverieís investigation into the characteristics 
        and patterns of behaviour in visitors to a museum website (1999) revealed 
        interesting data about the intentions of visitors to the New Mexico Museum 
        of Natural History and Science museum website which can be extrapolated 
        as being appropriate to all museum sites. The main purpose for visiting, 
        whether in a group or alone, was found to be learning, with 66.20% of 
        lone visitors and 91% of group visitors stating this as to learn. In contrast, 
        44% of lone visitors and 9% of visitors in a group stated that their main 
        purpose for visiting was to simply browse the site. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In the Science Museum there is a high volume of 
        specific enquiries to curators relating to the collections. This combined 
        with the popularity of our search engine and with Chadwick and Boverieís 
        results led us to conclude that we could do more to target visitor needs 
        through providing a science - subject oriented navigation alongside our 
        needs oriented navigation. Such a form of navigation would enable visitors 
        to reach specific information more rapidly and provide a useful focus 
        to the general educational interests demonstrated in the results of the 
        Chadwick and Boverie study.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This too was subject to a visitor study. In order 
        to evaluate a) whether the current navigation system was working or could 
        be improved and b) whether a new navigation system would get visitors 
        to the content they required more easily we undertook the aforementioned 
        study of June 1999.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">I have already referred to the print out of our 
        home page which examined existing navigation and design. The second half 
        of the evaluation concentrated on two topic navigation systems, one focusing 
        on three broad topic headings and the other on ten more specific topic 
        headings. These were developed in consultation with staff on the basis 
        of our collections and of other commonly used subject systems. The first 
        menu comprised three subjects: Science, Technology and Industry. The second 
        menu comprised nine subjects: Science, Health and Medicine, Power, Chemistry, 
        Communications, Engineering, Transport, Physics and Computing. These menus 
        were put on A5 sized cards.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">One selection of collections headings was chosen 
        as follows: Astronomy and Maths, Experimental Chemistry. Air Transport, 
        Civil Engineering, Space Technology, Bioscience, Agricultural Engineering, 
        Materials Science and Communications. An optimum division of collections 
        headings into subject areas was drawn up. The collections headings were 
        then placed on small cards such that they could be placed on top of the 
        subject menu headings. </span> </p>
      <p class="normal">Visitors were selected at random and shown one of the 
        two subject menus, they were then asked to place the collection headings 
        onto whichever of the subjects menus they felt they fitted best into. 
        They were informed that they could place more than one collections heading 
        on each subject menu, they were also informed that they could place a 
        collection heading on more than one subject menu.</p>
      <p><span class="normal">It was found that whilst the three broad subject 
        headings led people to place their collection heading cards in the right 
        general area, a substantial number of visitors placed headings in totally 
        irrelevant categories. For instance, 30% placed Experimental Chemistry 
        in Medicine, and 32% placed Materials Science in Technology.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Tests on the nine more specific subject headings 
        showed very high recognition for a greater number of collections areas 
        such as 91% of visitors placing Air Transport in Transport as opposed 
        to 83% placing it in Technology under the three broad subject headings. 
        This led us to conclude that, with some tweaking of collection heading 
        names to ensure that all were clear, the option of using around nine more 
        specific subjects was a more useful option for the visitor coming both 
        to learn and browse.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Studies like this are simple to arrange, do not 
        require technology or portable systems yet offer invaluable information 
        to museum website teams about their visitorsí needs. When taken in context 
        with pre-existing visitor studies and quantative analysis they enable 
        us to form a clearer picture of our visitors.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>We are still part of the museum </b></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Finally, it is important to set the site in the 
        context of our museum visitors, our museum audience. Marketing departments 
        and personnel employ tools which can be used to offer useful information 
        about Museum visitors and website visitors. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The biannual quantative MORI survey at the Science 
        Museum reveals interesting data on internet access and the Science Museum 
        website. Six out of ten visitors have internet access; the overall figure 
        in the general public is 21%. The table below shows the percentage of 
        visitors who have visited the website and compares it will the percentages 
        who have visited other websites.</span></p>

      <p><span class="normal">The sites listed are very popular and well known 
        sites. While these figures do not suggest that we compete with them on 
        a national scale, amongst our visitors we are evidently providing a useful 
        service.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Data can also be gathered from simple self-selecting 
        surveys on information leaflets. For instance, the Science Museum currently 
        runs a questionnaire on visitor information leaflets which includes amongst 
        other questions two about the Internet. Of 170 people responding to the 
        questionnaire 62% have internet access and of those 37% have visited the 
        site. Whilst this tells us nothing about the user experience it does place 
        our efforts to provide relevant information in context and will enable 
        the monitoring of growth and decrease in interest in the site. The important 
        things to note is that the opportunity to ask more pertinent questions 
        about the site is obviously open.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Determining audiences </b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Marketing expertise offers many more resources than 
        simply existing or forthcoming survey opportunities. The experience of 
        marketing and indeed other internal museum professionals can contribute 
        towards the development of a more visitor-centric site in other ways. 
        Visitor evaluations start from premises built on experience and knowledge, 
        from valid theories which we are not arrogant enough to leave untested. 
        Approaching content from a visitor focused point of view it is well to 
        gain inspiration from those who deal with visitors on a day to day basis 
        such as the marketing, education and research departments. In fact it 
        is essential to consult with as many of the forward facing museum professionals 
        as possible to ensure that as many groups as possible are considered and 
        assessed. It would be as much a mistake to present only detailed research 
        information on a museum website as it would be to present only marketing 
        information. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Simple internal exercises can easily provide new 
        ideas for user profiling and suggest visitor groups. Exercises of this 
        kind have been run at the Science Museum National Railway Museum and National 
        Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television as part of the redesign process 
        of these sites. In the case of the Science Museum it has resulted in plans 
        for a radical redesign and restructuring of the site in the case of the 
        other two museums it resulted in a re-direction of the existing site and 
        detailed content development.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Firstly it is important to assess who are the intended 
        audiences. Very often these will overlap with existing museum audiences. 
        For instance in the case of the Science Museum our list of audiences was 
        as follows:-</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Web Browsers, People wanting visitor information, 
        those in formal education, museum professionals, opinion formers, self-directed 
        researchers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Further to this the group were asked to offer suggestions 
        as to the needs of these various groups, specifics which could then be 
        broken down into general categories of needs as follows:- Authoritative 
        voice, Visit planning, General museum information. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Bearing in mind audiences and needs the group were 
        then asked to create scenarios for visitors to the site which helped to 
        demonstrate content and navigation paths. For instance, an opinion former 
        such as a journalist visits the site, finds press releases easily and 
        also notes forthcoming exiting exhibitions which will provide a good story 
        in two months time; a researcher comes to the site enters the research 
        section searches for all resources on a given topic, finds two exhiblets, 
        one online exhibition, various papers and a curatorial contact. They then 
        contact the library, link into the library contact and make an appointment 
        to visit. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Often such exercises throw up new and challenging 
        ways of structuring and presenting information. They must then be looked 
        at in the context of current statistical and qualitative data and of formative 
        evaluation.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">For museums the imperative to be accessible and 
        understandable is stronger now than ever before. In our eagerness to benefit 
        from the communication and narrative possibilities the Internet has to 
        offer to us we must be careful to take into account the intended audience. 
        We must be aware of the fact that we are still in the early stages of 
        a revolutionary medium and not berate ourselves where we fail. However, 
        we must also avoid the complacency that comes with our undoubted contribution 
        to the Webís development over the last six years. It is in asking questions 
        Do we actually provide visitors with clear information as well as interesting 
        information? Are we enabling our visitors to reach it as easily as we 
        can or are we setting out our own agenda? That we will find new ways to 
        engage with those visitors which will take us beyond the museum-centred 
        websites of the past into the more balanced and rich sites of the future. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It may seem a daunting prospect - self-examination 
        should result in change - yet we are amply provided with information and 
        opportunities to gather information in the new statistical evidence that 
        web sites produce by their very nature, in the legacy of visitor evaluation 
        studies done physically and the pools of knowledge which reside in the 
        different departments of the museum already. It is in combining all the 
        resources available to us, however small or large that we will be able 
        to move towards more visitor-centric museum websites.</span></p>
