      <p class="heading"><b>Learning History</b></p>
      <p><b class="author">Nicole Valli&egrave;res, McCord Museum of Canadian 
        History, Canada</b></p>
      <p align="center" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="small">The problems of access to 
          and distribution of museum materials are at the heart of a number of 
          initiatives undertaken by museum staff or agencies to draw on new technology 
          to achieve a wider diffusion of museum and archival resources. For example, 
          13 Montreal history museums have joined together to provide teachers 
          from greater Montreal and Quebec with an internet site containing information 
          on educational activities designed for students at the primary, secondary 
          and collegial levels. Within a broader context, CHINís Gateway to Canadian 
          learning Materials project is another initiative. </span></p>
        <p><span class="small">The school-museum partnership 
          is being renewed through the development of innovative technology-based 
          initiatives to use museum objects and research directly in the classroom. 
          Some ambitious projects, especially within the science museum world, 
          have led the way. Technology might well prove a vehicle to bring museum 
          resources into the classroom through the development of highly interactive 
          multimedia databases linked directly to the curriculum.</span></p>
        <p><span class="small">The McCord Museum of Canadian 
          History, in partnership with the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, 
          the Faculty of Education and Department of History from both McGill 
          University and Universit&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec &agrave; Montr&eacute;al, 
          and the Quebec Ministry of Education, is working to create new material 
          history-based resources for Canadian teachers. This project will focus 
          on the development of curriculum-linked teaching resources, drawn from 
          the collections of the partner museum. At the same time, the partner 
          organizations will examine the delivery of such resources to the classroom. 
          The project thus has two major areas of interest. The first is the integration 
          of the museum model of learning using objects and images into the more 
          traditional text-based curriculum materials of the primary and secondary 
          schools. The second is the evaluation of the Internet as a medium for 
          the diffusion of multimedia databases with age-specific interfaces, 
          and its efficacy as a support for teaching and learning.</span></p>
        <p><span class="small">This paper will discuss 
          the McCord Museum involvement in those 3 projects.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="heading"><b>Learning History</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">For this workshop, &quot;Finding Educational Sites,&quot; 
        I was asked to present the museum point of view. First, I would like to 
        point out that collection and information management, not education, is 
        my area of expertise, and my approach is that of a content provider. With 
        no special training in educational or learning theories, my view is in 
        many respects somewhat naive. However, given that the Internet is a recent 
        innovation, not yet highly exploited, and calls for new methods, ideas 
        and rules, I believe that this lack of expertise has at least one advantage 
        in a teamwork environment ñ I have no preconceived ideas about how to 
        teach or about how people learn.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Thus, as a content supplier, I would first like 
        to point out a relatively recent reality, one more specific to museums 
        ñ the presence of a profound change in not only how information is processed, 
        but also in how it is disseminated. With the advent of networking, information 
        is no longer created, disseminated and used in the same way. The museum, 
        a cultural institution and repository of collective memory and history, 
        faces a new reality that is profoundly destabilising traditional museum 
        methods, leading museums to review all of their practices.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Closely related to the presence of the Internet, 
        this change obviously arises from a new awareness of the value of and 
        potential for exploiting information via this new medium. Mindsets have 
        gradually changed (in fact, evolved) in such a way that from now on, information 
        relating to collections, and to all related activities, will be handled 
        in a more dynamic way. Based on the awareness of this &quot;new&quot; 
        strategic capital, attempts are underway to establish a true synergy among 
        the various stakeholders to ensure that they operate in &quot;open&quot; 
        communication mode, rather than in a vacuum. Stages in the production 
        process are reviewed from a perspective of versatility and, as a result, 
        cost-effectiveness.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Just as a quick review of this very specific area, 
        institutional priorities have gradually shifted over the last 15 years, 
        moving from inventory and data management toward operations and information 
        management and now focussing on access and dissemination of information 
        to the public. The information on an object, from multiple contexts, benefits 
        from optimised handling. Information on donors, fundraising, exhibitions, 
        publication projects, restoration and other areas are amalgamated with 
        descriptive and administrative information on the objects in the collection. 
        The data can be queried in numerous contexts and ways, and in many cases, 
        in ëa naturalí language. From the technical aspect, largely defined by 
        the limitations of the computer systems used, data has migrated from systems 
        that compartmentalised information to a much more integrated approach, 
        where technical imperatives have given way to transparent access. We have 
        moved from concave to convex, internal to external, specifically via the 
        Internet.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">At the same time, it is interesting to note that 
        the concept of network is changing and gradually expanding. It no longer 
        refers exclusively to communication, i.e., links among elements of a single 
        family or a single interest (in this case, museum collections), but more 
        broadly to decompartmentalization and openness. Within that context, most 
        of the data currently found in large centralised databases or even institutional 
        databases, although important and used by researchers and managers, are 
        currently, in most cases, of limited interest. However, imperfect or incomplete 
        does not in any way mean useless, and information on collections is not 
        static ñ indeed, just the opposite ñ it is part of a constantly evolving 
        reality. We must ensure however, that the work done over the last 25 years 
        - a substantial investment - goes beyond the immediate framework of the 
        museum institution. To evolve in this new context and exploit its potential 
        in a meaningful and productive manner, we have to look at joint projects, 
        network projects, and partnerships. Cultural heritage - as instrument 
        of knowledge for the benefit of a group - does not belong only to the 
        museum, but to the community as a whole. Thus, the only limit is the amount 
        of resources the community wants to devote to cultural heritage.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Thus, moving away from a &quot;data base&quot; to 
        what I could call here a &quot;knowledge base&quot;, meaning a resource 
        developed on a given subject, involves an approach that goes beyond simply 
        expanding multi-source access facilitated by a relatively user-friendly 
        access interface. In addition to descriptive databases linked specifically 
        to artefacts, the &quot;Rubikís cube&quot; approach (independent or directed) 
        must be supported by the availability of one or more interpretations that 
        will reinforce the learning process.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Within the Internet context, where we can virtually 
        tour sites, look at virtual exhibitions or &quot;search&quot; in on-line 
        databases (which sometimes offer users the option of creating and saving 
        their own files and thus exploiting a little further the Internetís interactive 
        capability), there is a real need for specific content, that meets specific 
        educational needs, for example the history sector. Quite simply, the need 
        for Internet content in this area is urgent, particularly given that history 
        museums have been identified as the most reliable source of knowledge 
        of our collective past. According to a study among adults conducted by 
        American researchers Rosenzweig and Thelen (The Presence of the Past ñ 
        Popular Uses of History in American Life, 1998) funded by the National 
        Endowment for the Arts, museums appear to be at the top of the list, ahead 
        of high-school and university teachers, books, television programs and 
        even parents. Paradoxically, another study conducted by Quebec researcher 
        Tamara Lemerise (1999) shows that history museums are, for young people, 
        the least popular in a field dominated by science and technology museums. 
        I would like to extrapolate slightly here, and compare those two North 
        American studies, which while they share neither the same methodologies 
        nor the same objectives, lead me to believe that although young people 
        may see history museums as dusty or uninteresting in the short term, the 
        fact remains that, in the long term, they are the ultimate &quot;historical&quot; 
        reference. As a repository of our collective heritage, and, in a certain 
        way, an interpretation of that heritage, we are <i>de facto </i>in a decisive 
        position that requires immediate and significant and meaningful action, 
        and thus entails considerable responsibility. Within that context, information 
        on the Internet cannot - can no longer? - be absent or simply available 
        in a summary format: it must be more complete and varied, interesting 
        to a variety of audiences, useful and most of all, used (I will come back 
        to this later).</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Fortunately, the Internet is evolving quickly, to 
        say the least, and its generations are short and promising. Thus, within 
        a context that extends beyond history museums, there are numerous programs 
        to initiate partnerships among museums ñ educational institutions, private 
        organisations, government. Obviously, a frequent trend is that when millions 
        are available, billions are needed. However, the reality is an increasing 
        number of partnerships. Although some emphasise content (I will come to 
        this below), the purpose of others is to perfect the tool. The problem 
        of material access and dissemination is at the centre of numerous projects 
        initiated by institutions or agencies to develop a tool for disseminating 
        museum resources to a wider audience.</span></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><span class="normal">As a local example, Montrealís 13 history museums, 
        including the McCord Museum, joined together in 1999 to provide a single 
        point from which history teachers can access a variety of information 
        on educational activities for primary and secondary students. Obviously, 
        this is only a showcase of activities available at the museum, and at 
        the present time, is not a place for accessing resources directly or exclusively 
        available on the Internet. The interface is simple and uses five research 
        headings: museums, school grades and cycles, subjects, themes and schedule 
        (http://musees-histoire-mtl.qc.ca). However, due to pressure from Quebec 
        teachers during the current school year (boycotting field trips), we were 
        unable to determine the actual impact of this tool on the organisation 
        of school activities.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Within a broader context, CHINís project to create 
        a centralised location for various Canadian museums resources available 
        for primary and secondary teachers is without a doubt a great example 
        of a tool made necessary by the growing number of products, thus meeting 
        the needs of the community. Obviously, increasingly effective search engines 
        provide access to those resources to a certain point. However, the catalogue 
        of resources prepared as part of the Gateway to Educational Materials 
        Project optimises on a broader scale those resources or projects developed 
        locally or individually. Thus, it is good to know that the museums exist; 
        but accessing all the educational resources in a given sector and on a 
        given theme, and determining whom specifically that resource is for, is 
        better still. The benefits will no doubt be immediate. One has only to 
        speak to teachers to get an idea of their distress over this new ëspace.í 
        And it is within this perspective that the McCord Museum worked with the 
        CHIN by supervising an intern who helped at various stages of the project, 
        notably, cataloguing museum resources. At the same time, in the museum 
        community, there have been related benefits from similar partnership projects. 
        Access to and better knowledge of existing products in oneís own area 
        stimulates research and subsequent developments. Without calling it &quot;competition,&quot; 
        there is no doubt that the desire to stand out from the crowd is contributing 
        in large part to the establishment of new standards, gaining in maturity 
        and, obviously, quality and relevance.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Museums as content providers and resource centres</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Access has become a priority for many governments, 
        and there are many examples. In general terms however, against the technical 
        backdrop of connectivity and hardware emerges a more crucial area ñ training, 
        learning and content.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">For example, like many other governments, the Quebec 
        Ministry of Education a few years ago sponsored a socio-economic conference 
        on information and communications technologies in education so as to determine 
        specific objectives, particularly the development of a common vision, 
        what measures to take and the resources required, and identifying partners. 
        Some consensus was reached, particularly with respect to the knowledge 
        and skills required, the active participation of teachers, the level of 
        computer hardware and teaching materials required, and finally, the development 
        of the network and linking schools to the network. (Curiously, no content 
        providers were shown on the list of conference guests, and few representatives 
        of the cultural community were on the list of observers). The conference 
        gave rise to a wide range of initiatives. Outside the purely technical 
        aspect of connectivity and hardware, large sums were subsequently devoted 
        to train teaching staff and for pedagogical research, and for the production 
        of content via the Information Highway Fund (IHF) in particular. In that 
        specific area, various projects were initiated in the cultural sector, 
        such as a project to help digitise collections for small museums. That 
        project was initiated by Quebecís Infomuse network, a provincial network 
        of some 100 Quebec museums. Initiatives of this type have given new impetus 
        to the drive to broaden access to our cultural heritage and helped make 
        a reality the desire of some Quebec museums to use the Internet. Obviously, 
        in the case of the Infomuse network, the initial objectives were to provide 
        institutions with a technological showcase. What we are seeing now is 
        the progressive evolution of brochure sites to content sites offering, 
        in many cases, access to a critical mass of information. Through these 
        first steps, a bank of strategic information is being built that can be 
        used to contribute to the subsequent development of new products. And 
        gradually, from a simple data repackaging approach, we are moving toward 
        a view of information as having a versatility that can be used to unleash 
        its inherent potential when creating new resources.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Thus with the realisation of the importance of this 
        &quot;external&quot; information that is increasingly accessible via the 
        Internet, access and reference frameworks and resource cataloguing projects 
        are being developed. But are those resources adequate? How can we be sure 
        that they are useful and, above all, used in the curriculum?</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The Internet has its own logic and presents some 
        challenges, namely, the need to review communication methods and define 
        new strategies appropriate to the medium used, redefine the interface 
        to allow real knowledge acquisition and determine how to use and create 
        ñ within a knowledge dissemination network context ñ a context favourable 
        to learning. The Internetís interactive capability fosters a dynamic space 
        in which users can be creative ñ a key component. This is especially so 
        when we consider that, according to some studies, including one by Professor 
        Philippe Marton of Universit&eacute; Laval, we retain:</span></p>

        <dir> 
          <p><span class="normal">10%&#9;of what we read</span></p>
          <p><span class="normal">20% &#9;of what we hear</span></p>
          <p><span class="normal">30%&#9;of what we see</span></p>
          <p><span class="normal">50% &#9;of what we hear and see</span></p>
          <p><span class="normal">70%&#9;of what we say</span></p>
          <p><span class="normal">90%&#9;of what we do.</span></p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p><span class="normal">A few months ago, I attended a talk given in New 
        York by Dr. Robert Cavalier of Carnegie Mellon University. As part of 
        his research into the use of technology in education, Dr. Cavalier conducted 
        a quantitative analysis to determine the level of learning based on the 
        tools used by the students, i.e., text, film and CD. The results of the 
        survey showed a significant statistical difference, favouring use of the 
        CD ñ interactivity. This space thus has to be designed as a means to provide 
        its own kind of experience, different from that of other mediums, making 
        use of as many senses as possible. Within their Mission Statement, the 
        firm Learn Technologies Interactive (Lyuen Chou) states, and I quote, 
        that &quot;the best entertainment is truly educational and the best learning 
        is truly entertaining ñ and that technology makes this possible&quot;. 
        I believe that this &quot;simple&quot; statement is an interesting introduction, 
        in that it summarises the objective of numerous initiatives implemented 
        in recent years. Boundaries are disappearing, and these two realities 
        can no longer be placed in opposition, or even in competition with each 
        other.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Learning history</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In the last few years, the science and technology 
        museum sector has been at the centre of the development of a number of 
        ambitious projects that have paved the way for renewed school-museum partnerships, 
        and that have demonstrated that the use of technology could be a catalysing 
        and relevant element in the learning process. We have moved from an answer-based 
        approach to a question-based approach, thus giving the student part of 
        the initiative for his/her learning. However, although history museums 
        are, traditionally, places of memory and not experimentation, this does 
        not prevent them from becoming dynamic stakeholders in the education process 
        by facilitating the appropriation of knowledge and encouraging debate 
        through the questioning process.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">For example, the Village Prologue (http://prologue.educ.infinit.net), 
        a Quebec on-line initiative composed of more than 13,000 pages on an 1852 
        community, was developed during the 1980s. On-line activities started 
        in 1987, and the first interactive exchanges with &quot;people of the 
        past&quot; began in 1991. In short, the Village Prologue is a micro-world 
        representing a seigneury in Lower Canada in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, 
        and experienced teachers, historians and programmers have been working 
        on it for several years. Teachers and historians created fictional residents 
        of the seigneury and the village following experiments done with teachers, 
        students and parents. They imagined their daily lives, homes, the objects 
        around them, the events that marked their lives and even their physiques 
        and personalities. Several activities are available on the site: corresponding 
        with the people, problem-solving activities, writing activities, discussions 
        and exchanges and the animation of one or more characters for adults. 
        With the annual support of more than 200 facilitators who correspond with 
        students in Quebec, this project has for some years been supported by 
        the federal government via the Grassroots Program, part of the Learning 
        Resources of Schoolnet Canada. The McCord Museum is currently working 
        in partnership with the people responsible for the Village Prologue project 
        to ensure that real artefacts are used in the dissemination of information 
        and learning of the history of Quebec at that time. We are incorporating 
        the concept of object-based learning with traditional learning modes. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">History museums are all too familiar with the evocative 
        power of the object taking second place to written material. However, 
        things change, and museum resources are now being used more extensively. 
        It is no longer rare to see groups of students consulting our archives 
        and Ö objects, looking for answers or at the very least clues for further 
        learning. This partnership has not always been a given, but does promise 
        the expansion of knowledge.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">To develop significant and meaningful content, like 
        many other museums, the McCord Museum wants to make a more dynamic contribution. 
        Encouraged by a government policy that puts history on the curriculum, 
        the McCord Museum, close to one year ago, proposed a partnership of stakeholders 
        from museums, universities, schools and the Quebec Ministry of Education 
        to develop specific content that is directly related to the curriculum 
        defined by the Ministry of Education. Submitted to the Social Sciences 
        and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), the project received 
        one of 22 grants for all of Canada as part of the new Community-University 
        Research Alliances (CURA) program. Launched in 1999, CURA is a pilot program 
        to help organisations within communities and university institutions combine 
        forces and tackle issues they have identified as being of common, priority 
        concern. The very existence of this new program, which promotes partnerships 
        and funds the McCord project, is eloquent proof of the need and willingness 
        to support the development of museum-classroom projects.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It is within this context that the McCord Museum 
        of Canadian History, in partnership with the McGill Institute for the 
        Study of Canada, the Faculty of Education and Department of History from 
        both McGill University and Universit&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec &agrave; 
        Montr&eacute;al, and the Quebec Ministry of Education, is working to create 
        new material history-based resources for Canadian teachers. Not only will 
        we be building on the traditional approaches of object-based learning 
        in the development of curriculum-linked teaching resources, but we will 
        be exploring the use of the technology, and specifically the internet, 
        in delivering these resources to students and teachers in their classrooms 
        and their homes.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The project summary, drafted under the direction 
        of Dr. Victoria Dickenson, Director General of the McCord Museum, is as 
        follows.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Project Laurier has two major areas of interest. 
        The first is the integration of the museum model of learning using objects 
        and images into the more traditional text-based curriculum materials of 
        the primary and secondary schools. The second is the evaluation of the 
        Internet as a medium for the diffusion of multimedia databases with age-specific 
        interfaces, and its efficacy as a support for teaching and learning.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Project Laurier is a three-phase project over a 
        three-year period. The first phase embodies primarily the research phase 
        of the project. The team will conduct a literature review in the two study 
        areas: object-based teaching and material history; and the role of new 
        technologies in classroom teaching and learning. During this period, the 
        team will also conduct on-site interviews with students and teachers at 
        a minimum of eight sites in Quebec and Ontario as well as expert interviews 
        with stakeholders at the Minist&egrave;re de lí&Eacute;ducation, the Ontario 
        Ministry of Education, and various provincial teachers association, as 
        well appropriate resource persons among a group of expert advisors.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The second phase deals with prototype development, 
        testing and evaluation. Based on research and information gathered in 
        phase one, the team will begin to develop the prototype application. Information 
        from stakeholder interviews, curriculum review, and assessment of museum 
        collections, will allow the team to select two curriculum units, one primary 
        and one secondary, for development in the prototype. The match between 
        curriculum units and museum resources requires some care. Not all will 
        be amenable to the addition of museum resources, and not all topics will 
        be reflected in museum collections. And as the most crucial part of any 
        web application is the interface design, the team will collect data on 
        user group and analyse these according to their comments, and submit the 
        application to selected peer reviewers as well. It is anticipated that 
        design changes will be required at the level of interface, but that development 
        of the database will be largely unaffected. Finally, during this phase, 
        the team will begin the development of a business plan to ensure the ongoing 
        support of the project.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The third and last phase focuses on completion of 
        prototype, finalisation of business plan, and integration of material 
        into the curriculum on a regional basis. The results of phase two evaluation 
        will be integrated into application design, and the prototype expanded 
        to include additional curriculum units for both primary and secondary 
        levels. Curriculum units will be selected and museum resources prepared 
        for the database. The addition of scholarly narratives created specifically 
        for the project will be incorporated into the application. While the prototype 
        application interface will be designed primarily for the Quebec environment, 
        the bilingual multimedia database will be usable with a variety of interface 
        designs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This project is significant on a number of levels: 
        one, it acknowledges the need for additional primary resources to enrich 
        the curriculum in the teaching of Canadian history; two, it acknowledges 
        the increasingly pervasive role of information technology in the Canadian 
        community and in the schools; three, it acknowledges the importance of 
        collaboration in incorporating technological change into traditional institutions; 
        and four, it acknowledges the needs of the next generation for technology-mediated 
        access to Canadian content. Children will continue to attend school, teachers 
        will continue to teach, and classes will continue to come to museums on 
        field trips; but museums and schools are working to prepare themselves 
        for new modes of access to content and to curriculum. Project Laurier 
        is part of that preparation.</span></p>
