      <p class="heading"><b>Virtual Objects and Real Education: A Prolegomenon 
        version .1</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER"></p>
      <p class="author"><b>Glen H. Hoptman</b>, <b>Jonathan P. Latimer</b>, <b>Marsha 
        Weiner</b>, The Lightbeam Group/Studio, USA</p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote><p class="small">Since the material and informational assets of our cultural 
        institutions are now liberated from bricks and mortar, the challenge facing 
        museum professionals and educators is how to best apply technology to 
        fulfill the needs of the general population and the aspirations of the 
        institutions. against the backdrop of the popular PBS production, <i>The 
        Antiques Road Show</i>; Prolegomenon version .1 integrates the foreword 
        thinking of James Burke's work <i>The Knowledge Web</i>, and presents 
        how the traditional museum-based orientation of artifact-as-history can 
        finally fulfill our highest democratic ideals of education, once stated 
        by John Dewey. Those ideals now have an opportunity to be fulfilled in 
        the triune function of CONTENT, CURRICULUM, and COMMUNITY, a credo that 
        is embraced by efforts like bigchalk.com, sponsor of our current work 
        in this arena. Prolegomenon version.1 projects a blueprint as to how the 
        cultural assets of museums can provide a true interdisciplinary approach 
        to learning that will reflect Burke's suggested," glimpse of what a learning 
        experience might be like in the twenty-first century." It is the beginning 
        of a community-based dialogue related to evolving an enhanced philosophy 
        and practice of education.</p></blockquote>
      <p class="heading"><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">For decades the revolution of personal computing 
        has been equated to that of the impact of the printing press. Some zealots 
        even went so far as to equate the worldwide, life-changing power of personal 
        computing with that of writing itself. Regardless, such revolutionary 
        times demand the skills of inquiry and reflection, especially when developing 
        a strategy of how to apply the revolutionary tools now available for K-12 
        education.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The grandfather of both modern, democratic and Progressive 
        education, John Dewey, reminds us: "The primary school grew practically 
        out to the popular movement of the sixteenth century, when, along with 
        the invention of printing and the growth of commerce, it became a business 
        necessity to know how to read, write, and figure. The aim was distinctly 
        a practical one; it was utility; getting command of these tools, the symbols 
        of learning, NOT for the <i>sake</i> of learning, but because they gave 
        access to careers in life otherwise closed."</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Once education got beyond the practical mandate, 
        educators then returned to the struggle of providing a democratic education 
        that had cultural components, "to put into the hands of people the key 
        to the old learning so that they might see a world with a larger horizon."</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Such is the challenge in applying today's technologies 
        to bringing museum assets to classrooms.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Hence, Prolegomenon version .1</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">But first, and aside:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Though "<i>The Antiques Road Show"</i> may curdle 
        the corpuscles of some museum professionals, in it's fourth season on 
        Public Broadcasting, 333 PBS stations carry the show. It is PBS' top rated 
        ongoing series, with an average audience of 6.43 million.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Here's a description for those unfamiliar with the 
        program: A group of professionals, most of whom work as antique dealers, 
        auctioneers and appraisers, not museum professionals, bring their well-announced 
        tent to town.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Locals are invited to bring family heirlooms or 
        treasures found at flea markets, garage sales or purchased in galleries. 
        The fleets of professionals, in various categories, are available to appraise 
        the value of the presented objects.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Throughout the program there are breakout segments 
        when the audience sees an individual, with their object, sitting opposite 
        a professional in a lighted area. The professional, with the command of 
        Regis Philben, asks, "How did you come by this?" After the tale is told, 
        the professional asks the more pointed question, "What do you think it's 
        worth?"</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">After listening, the expert nod with acknowledged 
        concern, and then describes, in stunning detail, details about the object. 
        Through the expert's description the audience learns about lost techniques, 
        artisans and craftsmen, historical preferences, economic forces, manufacturing 
        challenges and progress, fashions, and fads. Finally the expert evaluates 
        the object and the cultural spelunker exits, feeling somewhere between 
        confirmed that their object truly is a treasure, or disappointed. Regardless, 
        the collectors leave enlightened--they've learned something.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">One breakout segment was unique.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Sitting opposite an expert in Early American painting 
        was a 12-year-old girl. With her legs rhythmically swinging from the seat 
        of the chair, the expert learned that the painting before the audience, 
        a portrait of a woman of an indeterminate age, was recovered from a dumpster 
        by the girl and her mom. The child confidently gave her explanation of 
        the painting including, the era it came from, information about the painted 
        interior, the subject's costume, her status and that of her family, and 
        more.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The expert generously beamed surprise, pride, and 
        approval at this young collector. When asked how she knew so much, she 
        commented, with comfortable enthusiasm, (Iím quoting from memory)," I 
        just love this show and all my family knows it. So now when I watch I've 
        got a whole lot of books to look through. I've learned how to look at 
        stuff and find out what it means. I just think this show is great." </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The segment was:</span></p>
   <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="normal">In some ways it was an educator's dream. It showed 
          a child who has the <u>means</u> to follow her enthusiasm, a child who 
          has <u>resources at hand from which to learn more</u>.</span></p>
        <p><span class="normal">It was a successful use of media that suggests 
          an adaptation of museum assets to web-based education.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">To address that: Prolegomenon version .1</span></p>
      <p><b><span class="normal">Prolegomenon</span></b><span class="normal"> 
        is a collection of readings or exercises that will lead to further understanding 
        and development that will advance a way of thinking on a particular subject. 
        A present day prolegomenon that addresses new technology and a new approach 
        to knowledge is James Burke's <i>The Knowledge Web.</i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In his book Burke presents ten different journeys 
        "across the great web of change." Though the reader can read the book 
        from cover to cover, Burke also offers "gateways"ó notations in the margins 
        that lead the reader to other places in the book where the timeline of 
        one inquiry crosses the timeline of another. Such crossings reveal, for 
        example, how the products of a nineteenth-century perfume-spray manufacturer 
        and the chemist who discovered how to crack gasoline from oil came together 
        to create the carburetor.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The result is a sense of the connections between 
        knowledge, events, thoughts, and serendipity. It is, in Burke's own words, 
        "a glimpse of what a learning experience might be like in the twenty-first 
        century once we have solved the problem of information overload." He even 
        goes so far as to suggest that our brains are hard-wired for such higher 
        level, pattern-recognition which yields the context and relevance of information.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The book, both in its content and layout, is begging 
        to be free of the page. The content is begging to be applied to the tools 
        now availableó </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">interactive communication tools which allow a 
          user to traverse various timelines</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">in media rich environments,</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">which are linked to data resources that will 
          illuminate each step of the looping timelines, along with the ability 
          to communicate about oneís findings anywhere in the world.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The same tools suggested by Burke's <i>prolegomenon</i> 
        can be applied to museum assets to liberate the intellectual wealth of 
        cultural institutions and to help fulfill the artfully crafted Mission 
        Statements shared by many institutions; <i>to educate and uplift our democracy</i>.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">And in what better arena to deploy those liberated 
        resources then education.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">When interactive museum resources are joined with 
        educational requirements and communication technology, the public then 
        gets a golden triune function: <i>CONTENT</i>, <i>CURRICULUM</i> and <i>COMMUNITY</i>. 
        These are the three foundations upon which bigchalk.com has evolved it's 
        approach to the development of educational resources. It is in association 
        with bigchalk.com that this paper was written, and it is with them that 
        we at Lightbeam are designing a series of educational modules that embody 
        the spirit of this paper.</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">The CONTENT comes from some of the most highly 
          regarded institutions together with the extensive reference assets of 
          bigchalk.com</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Databases allow the means for interdisciplinary 
          connections to be made across the entire CURRICULUM.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">And the COMMUNITY of teachers, parents, and students 
          can communicate and interact via communication technologies.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">bigchallk.com has at its core this triune function:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>CONTENT</b> of the highest, most trusted level.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>CURRICULUM</b> to provide a framework of inquiry.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>COMMUNICATION</b> tools to involve family and 
        community in the education process.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Relevance to Education</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">One of the unfortunate aspects of formal education 
        today is that in many places it is still carried out much the same way 
        that it was in the 19th century. Students are still gathered together 
        in a school and moved from one room and grade to another according to 
        a rigid schedule. They sit in orderly rows and use standardized textbooks 
        that do not recognize the differences in learning styles, interests, needs, 
        or abilities of each individual student. All of the limitations associated 
        with the factory approach to manufacturing are inherent in the current 
        educational system. Itís even run on a calendar based on 19th century 
        agricultural practices.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">But the introduction of the Web and other information 
        technologies into the classroom turns this traditional paradigm for education 
        upside down. It changes many of the most basic relationships, including 
        the:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">link between time and studies;</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">connection between the teacher and the student;</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">role of the teacher;</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">content of the curriculum; and the</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">approaches to delivering information.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">These changes are based on a new relationship between 
        humans and information that is swiftly evolving.</span></p>
     <blockquote>
          
        <p><span class="normal">1. Information is no longer a scarce commodity. 
          In the past, information (facts and ways of manipulating those facts) 
          was difficult to obtain. It required seeking out someone with the proper 
          training and knowledge to learn from (a wise man or magus) or enrolling 
          in and academy or school (a teacher or professor).</span></p>
        <p><span class="normal">2. Information is no longer expensive. Obtaining 
          a good education can be prohibitively expensive, especially if a student 
          wants to attend a first-class school or college. Even textbooks are 
          far more expensive than other books with a similar trim size and page 
          count. But, information is available on the Web low-cost.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">The wide availability of information (as opposed 
        to knowledge and wisdom) is forcing a complete reorientation of the concept 
        of teaching and a redefinition of education. Quality education acknowledges 
        the innate curiosity of children and their desire to understand and master 
        their environment. It also recognizes that children have different interests 
        and learning styles, and that they progress at different rates. While 
        the acquisition of basic skills (reading, writing, mathematics, and the 
        scientific method) still needs to be stressed, the emphasis is on individual 
        achievement and challenge. A child is encouraged to learn skills at a 
        pace appropriate to that student regardless of standardized norms or grade 
        level. Technological tools such as the Web allow for this kind of individual 
        instruction, but it also presents a series of challenges for all concerned.</span></p>
      
          
      <p><span class="normal">1. For the first time students have easy access 
        to all kinds of information, some good, some bad. The challenges for students 
        are:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">How to seek and request information</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">How to evaluate sources of information</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">How to separate good information from bad</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">How to open new pathways and new connections 
          in information</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">2. The challenges for teachers are:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">How to give students the skills to seek and evaluate 
          information (reading, writing, speaking, listening and thinking)</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">How to help students open new connections for 
          information;</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">How to treat children with respect for their 
          individuality. Children have different interests and learning styles, 
          and that they progress at different rates.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">3. The challenges for information providers/publishers 
        are:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">How to package information to make it appealing 
          to students and teachers: instructional design, editing,</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">How to make sure the information is accurate: 
          editing, fact-checking.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading"><b>The Impact of the Web</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Taken together, these challenges require a reexamination 
        and rethinking of the nature and goals of education. As things now stand, 
        most of this thinking has resulted in applying old solutions to the new 
        technologies. For example, placing a book on the Web is not much better 
        than reprinting it on paper. In fact, a book may be harder to read on 
        the Web. But what if we donít stop there? If that book can be made interactive, 
        if readers can ask questions and comment on the book, or if the bookís 
        parts can be linked to other information on the Web, it suddenly becomes 
        a richer, more useful (and more attractive) tool. Then suppose that much 
        of that information the book is linked to is contained in museums around 
        the world, that single click would take the user to a related object or 
        display. Think how much richer that book would become. Imagine what that 
        little girl on The Antiques Road Show could do with that.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The Internet and World Wide Web provide the opportunity, 
        if issues of the various equal access "divides" are adequately addressed, 
        to be the great democratizer of education. With the comprehensive wiring 
        of schoolsÖultimately to the desktop of each and every studentÖthe opportunities 
        that information access presents can be realized by everyone. And with 
        the proper tools and interfacesÖlearning is liberated from the classroom.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">For the purposes of this Prolegomenon, here are 
        some of the possibilities the Web presents:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Exploring the Frontiers of Knowledge:</b> The 
        Web offers an opportunity for creative expression and problem solving 
        that go beyond established bodies of knowledge. An emphasis on innovation 
        is necessary if students are going to learn to adapt to a changing world 
        and ultimately take part in shaping change.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Getting the Most out of the Time Available:</b> 
        Once issues of equity and teacher proficiency in the design and use of 
        digital resources has been properly addressed then time is no longer the 
        major structuring element for students use of the Web. As students proceed 
        at their own pace, time becomes more generalized, less specific. Learning 
        can take place anytime, and anywhere, not just during a specific class 
        period</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Measuring progress also becomes individualized: 
        Any student can approach any lesson or take any test at any time. Teachers 
        can measure progress in terms of milestones, goals, or objectives, rather 
        than in terms of periods, days, or weeks. The spectrum of possible "correct" 
        answers can be expanded exponentially to reflect the expressive and representational 
        tools used by the students and saved in their respective portfolios.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Individual Learning:</b> Learning is a life-long 
        process, not an activity associated only with institutions. Many schools 
        promote the passive acquisition of knowledge. The Web allows individuals 
        to become responsible for their own learning. Properly used, the Web can 
        teach students to use reason and logic and to apply these tools to engage 
        with the world. Teaching basic skills and content areas can be enhanced 
        by using the Web for a wide variety of activities including Virtual Field 
        Trips, Virtual Science Labs for all ages, and student activities such 
        as a Math Team, Mock Trial, Science Olympiad, or Chess Club.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Collaborative Learning:</b> We live in a culture 
        that stresses individual self-fulfillment, sometimes at the expense of 
        others. Some schools err on the side of stressing the competitive and 
        private nature of learning. The World Wide Web allows learning to become 
        a cooperative effort in which shared ideas enhance each studentís experience 
        and understanding. Teachers can compare notes and share best practices 
        with teachers around the world. They can also compare their studentís 
        performance with other classes.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Diversity:</b> Because the Web is an opening 
        to the world, it allows students to experience the racial, ethnic and 
        cultural diversity they might not find in their local classroom. Perceiving 
        the needs and caring about the welfare of others is fundamental to becoming 
        a mature person.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Social Responsibility:</b> Because of its remarkable 
        ability to inform, the Web offers a unique opportunity to encourage social 
        responsibility in students. This encompasses compassion for other individuals 
        and responsibility for working on solutions to the problems of the immediate 
        community and of the larger national and international community.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>The Opportunities for Museums</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The Web and other information technologies offer 
        an unparalleled opportunity for museums; libraries, zoological parks, 
        and other institutions devoted to the acquisition, conservation, study, 
        exhibition, and interpretation of objects of artistic, historical, or 
        scientific value. Many of these opportunities parallel those listed above 
        for education.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Extending a Museumís Geographic Reach:</b> First, 
        a museumís range will be extended beyond anything imagined in the past. 
        Geography no longer matters. The audience doesnít need to come to the 
        museum; the museum can go to the audience.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Getting the Most out of the Time Available:</b> 
        As with educational institutions, museums will no longer be restricted 
        by time. On the Web, museum collections can be reached anytime. People 
        will be able to spend as much or as little time with each exhibit or each 
        object as they need. They will not have to put up with crowds or obnoxious 
        patrons, and neither will the staff.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Collaborative Learning:</b> Information can be 
        traded through the Web in ways that were impossible in the past. Museums 
        will be able to pool their information, easily comparing objects from 
        different collections and sharing their interpretive expertise. They can 
        even [ask] call on their audience for help when the occasion calls for 
        it, as has been done very successfully by the National Museum of American 
        History at the Smithsonian. Curators put objects that they couldnít identify 
        in a small cabinet near one of museumís entrances. They marked it plainly 
        with a request for help [from] form their visitors. Patrons loved it. 
        Here was something that stumped the experts. But on several occasions 
        patrons knew what the object was--they recalled seeing one in grandpaís 
        barn or grandmaís kitchen. Everyone won: the museum solved a mystery and 
        their visitors felt involved.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">To show one way in which museums can enrich and 
        enliven a student's education; here is a concept for developing an interactive, 
        electronically mediated curriculum. Each of the modules to be developed 
        for this program would be significantly enhanced by access to museum collections.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In places the physical classroom is disappearing. 
        Instead, a class consists of students scattered across the globe, connected 
        electronically. For example, students from many countries have participated 
        in virtual expeditions, explorations, investigations, and discussions. 
        They have traveled together to the ocean abyss by submersible, to Mayan 
        ruins by bicycle, and into the atmosphere of Jupiter with the Galileo 
        probe.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In Deweyís terms, even though students share these 
        virtual experiences vicariously through electronic means, they can be 
        very educational. He postulated that the experience that educates best 
        is shared inquiry. Shared inquiry involves communication, which for Dewey 
        is inherently educational. As he wrote in <i>Democracy and Education</i> 
        (1916), &quot;... all communication (and hence all genuine social life) 
        is educative. To be a recipient of a communication is to have an enlarged 
        and changed experience...&quot; More than any other medium, the Internet 
        offers an enormous opportunity for communication and sharing inquiries. 
        The Web is a universe of rapidly evolving virtual worlds populated by 
        people with shared interests who can be located anywhere in the &quot;real&quot; 
        world. Thousands log on every day to ask questions. Chat rooms, bulletin 
        boards, FAQ's, and Web sites devoted to arcane subjects abound. If the 
        information exists, it is probably on the Web.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Dewey also said (again in <i>Democracy and Education</i>) 
        &quot;The educator's part in the enterprise of education is to furnish 
        the environment which stimulates responses and directs the learner's course.&quot; 
        In an educational setting, one of the goals of student research is to 
        find the best and most accurate information available. Museums and their 
        sister institutions are the custodians of much of the best information 
        and best objects created by human beings. Making that content available 
        to classrooms over the Internet will create a whole new audience for each 
        museumís collections. In the long run, it may also create new knowledge 
        as well.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">So let me give you a glimpse of the future of interactive, 
        electronically mediated education. Dewey gives a hint of what this might 
        be like in his 1903 pamphlet, <i>Logical Conditions of a</i> <i>Scientific 
        Treatment of Morality</i>. In it he points out that:</span></p>
      <blockquote>
          
        <p><span class="normal">Students of logic are familiar with the distinction 
          between the fact of particularity and the qualifications or distinguishing 
          traits of a particularó a distinction which has been variously termed 
          one between the &quot;That&quot; and the &quot;What,&quot; or between 
          &quot;This&quot; and &quot;Thisness.&quot; Thisness refers to a quality 
          which, however sensuous it be (such as hot, red, loud) ... [i]t is something 
          a presentation <i>has</i>, rather than what it just <i>is</i>. ... The 
          selection of any particular &quot;This&quot; as the immediate subject 
          of judgment is not arbitrary, however, but is dependent upon the end 
          involved in the interest that is uppermost. ...Purely objectively, there 
          is no reason for choosing any one of the infinite possibilities rather 
          than another.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">In a classroom, finding connections between the 
        qualities of &quot;Thisness&quot; offers avenues for discovering whole 
        new ranges of knowledge. With the availability of information from the 
        entire world, knowledge will become broad, contextual, and interdisciplinary. 
        Imagine working out concepts such as redness or loudnessó or frogginess. 
        Imagine the possibilities and join us in developing a new epistemology 
        which, in a period of time that may be much shorter than we imagine, will 
        lead to a &quot;<i>New Progressive Education.com</i>.&quot;</span></p>
