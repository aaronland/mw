      <p class="heading"><b>Creating Online Experiences in Broadband Environments</b></p>
      <p class="author"><b>Jim Spadaccini, Ideum, USA</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote class="small"> 
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The emergence of broadband technology has changed the 
        Internet experience for millions of users. Faster Internet connections 
        create opportunities and unique problems for Web developers. More compelling 
        resources can be created for broadband connectionsólarger and/or more 
        graphics, better quality video, and more interactivity are a few of the 
        options. Most Web visitors, however, donít have a broadband connection. 
        The tension between taking advantage of the latest technology to create 
        the most compelling experiences possible and creating resources that are 
        accessible to a broad public audience is not a problem unique to developers 
        in the museum world. But it is one that is particularly sensitive given 
        the fact that most museums receive some sort of public funding and have 
        a mission to serve the community at large. Unlike the museum floor, usersí 
        experiences with online resources have always differed due to factors 
        such as connection-speed and the capabilities of their computers. The 
        emergence of broadband (and faster computers) has made this problem more 
        pronounced. So what are the options? What are the advantages that broadband 
        presents? How can museums take advantage of what broadband offers without 
        leaving other visitors behind? What technologies and techniques can developers 
        use to create compelling online experiences that are &quot;scalable&quot; 
        for visitors connecting at different speeds?</p> </blockquote>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The term broadband is used in this paper 
        to mean more bandwidthówhich means faster connections for Internet visitors. 
        This differs from the definition found in <i>Websterís Dictionary</i>: 
        &quot;of, relating to, or being a communications network in which a frequency 
        range is divided into multiple independent channels for simultaneous transmission 
        of signals (as voice, data, or video).&quot; If you took this out-dated 
        definition and applied it to the Internet, it would be defined as a broadband 
        environment regardless of the connection speed. Broadband can include 
        multimedia (sound, video, images, etc.), but the speed of the connection 
        is what differentiates it from dial-up Internet access. Cable modem or 
        DSL (digital subscriber line) connections are the most common types of 
        "consumer" broadband connections.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="normal"><b>How Fast? </b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Cable modems and DSL connections range 
        from 385 Kbps all the way up to 40 Mbps. These connections are roughly 
        10 to 1200 times faster than a 56K modem connection. In addition, cable 
        modem and DSL connections are on all the timeóthere is no "dial-up." This 
        a fundamental change in how users interact with the Web: for broadband 
        users, the Web is not only faster but "always on."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>How Many?</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">According to the Yankee Group (<a href="http://www.yankeegroup.com/">http://www.yankeegroup.com/</a>), 
        a technology research company, residential high-speed Internet services 
        will grow to 3.3 million subscribers this year. The number of subscribers 
        is expected grow to 16.6 million by the year 2004. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Spurring the growth of broadband 
        connections is the trend toward more multimedia on the Web. According 
        to the report, "Beyond T1/E1 1999-2000, North American Residential Broadband 
        Access Market Opportunities," published by Communications Industry Researchers, 
        Inc. (CIR)<br>
        (<a href="http://www.cir-inc.com/">http://www.cir-inc.com/</a>), the average 
        file transfer from the Web is now 60Kb, which is 15 times larger than 
        it was a few years ago. This not only makes broadband connections seem 
        more attractive, it renders dial-up connections increasingly inadequate.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">While the number of individuals 
        with high-speed access is estimated to grow considerably, only a small 
        percentage of the total U.S. Internet population is currently connecting 
        with broadband technology. According to the Computer Industry Almanac 
        (<a href="http://www.c-i-a.com/">http://www.c-i-a.com/</a>), there are 
        110 million Internet users in the United States at present. This means 
        that less than 3% of Americans are connecting using cable modems or DSL 
        connections from home, which, of course, doesn't include school visitors 
        or people who surf at work with high-speed connections. Still, the number 
        of visitors connecting with broadband is much smaller than those signing 
        on with dial-up. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Interestingly, the CIR report also 
        predicts residential broadband connections will top 31 million by 2003. 
        This is significantly higher (and a year sooner) than the Yankee Group's 
        estimation of just over 16 million by 2004. So while Internet researchers 
        disagree on the numbersóthe increase in broadband subscribers will be 
        significant by any estimation.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Webcasting </b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Webcasting is the first technology to 
	take full advantage of broadband on a wide scale. Large commercial Webcasting 
	sites have, in the last year, developed their own &quot;broadband sections&quot; 
	trying to appeal directly to users of the technology. Webcasting giant 
	Yahoo! Broadcast, for example, has a broadband category (<a href="http://www.broadcast.com/broadband/">http://www.broadcast.com/broadband/)</a>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <br>
        <span class="normal">Webcasting is a technology in which audio or video 
        content is digitized, encoded, and &quot;broadcast&quot; through the Internet. 
        The content can be accessed live or on-demand. The technology is capable 
        of delivering different rate streams depending on the usersí connection. 
        In other words, someone connecting with a 56K modem may receive a different 
        quality stream than someone connecting with a cable modem, DSL, or another 
        broadband connection. The higher quality broadband streams began appearing 
        on the Internet in 1999. Before that, most content providers (and developers 
        of the technology) didnít bother with high-bandwidth streams because the 
        audience just wasnít there. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Webcasting is the perfect technology 
        for the emergence of broadband. Itís completely scalable: You can create 
        one program and deliver high-quality video to broadband users, a few frames-a-second 
        video to 56K dial-up users, and even an audio stream to a user with an 
        antiquated 14.4K modem. In creating these different streams, youíre not 
        only reaching virtually every Internet user who wants to tune in, but, 
        in creating the broadband stream, youíre providing a way for future users 
        to see a relatively high-quality archive of the program. So while broadband 
        users may be few in number nowóthe broadband stream may be the one most-accessed 
        in the future as more and more users connect at higher speeds.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Much of my own experience comes 
        from helping to create broadband streams for Webcasts held at the Exploratorium 
        in San Francisco. In August 1999, the Exploratorium sent a crew to Turkey 
        to film the solar eclipse and send back video via satellite. This signal 
        was encoded and one of the streams was designated for broadband visitors 
        (<a href="http://webevents.broadcast.com/exploratorium/solareclipse/">http://webevents.broadcast.com/exploratorium/solareclipse/</a>). 
        The broadband stream was encoded at 300 Kbps or roughly at 9 times the 
        rate of an encoded stream for a 56K modem. With a higher data rate, there 
        is higher quality. The video seems less jumpy (more frames per second), 
        clearer (less &quot;lossy&quot; compression), and has a larger window 
        size. Following the Eclipse Webcast, The Exploratorium conducted a Webcast 
        for the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Loma Prieta Earthquake (<a href="http://www.exploratorium.com/faultline/remembering.html">http://www.exploratorium.com/faultline/remembering.html</a>) 
        and a program on the Science of Wine (<a href="http://webevents.broadcast.com/exploratorium/wine1199/">http://webevents.broadcast.com/exploratorium/wine1199/</a>). 
        Both of these programs have broadband streams. The Loma Prieta Webcast 
        has a T-1 stream which is about 100K per-second (which, it could be argued, 
        is not a &quot;true&quot; broadband stream). The Science of Wine has a 
        300K stream. For almost all major Webcasts, the Exploratorium now routinely 
        creates at a 100Kbpsóif not a 300Kbpsóstream.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The only drawback to creating high-band 
        streams is cost. Most of the expense is the cost of bandwidth. One hundred 
        people connecting to a 300K stream are going to use 9 times the bandwidth 
        that 100 people connecting to a 56K stream will use. Creating the broadband 
        stream itself is simpleóit just requires that such a stream is encoded. 
        Which may require an additional computer to facilitate the encoding for 
        a live broadcast. </span> </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>On Demand</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Streaming video can also be delivered 
        "on demand." Video clips can be integrated into Web sites, and different 
        versions can be delivered to visitors with different types of connections. 
        RealNetwork's (<a href="http://www.real.com/">http://www.real.com</a>) 
        new "G2" format allows developers to encode video clips which are automatically 
        "scaled" based on the speed of a visitor's connection. The RealPlayer, 
        which is used to play RealVideo files on the visitor's computer, contains 
        settings that alert the server to the type of connection. RealNetwork 
        calls this "SureStream" technology. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Recently, I developed a site for 
	the Exploratorium and NASA's Sun-Earth Connection Education Forum focusing 
	on this year's Solar Maximum. SolarMax 2000 (<A HREF="http://www.solarmax2000.com/">http://www.solarmax2000.com/</A>) 
	contains video clips of interviews with solar scientists that utilize 
	G2 technology. During the encoding process I specified which types of 
	connections were to be supported. Each encoded file contains optimized 
	"versions" for 28K, 56K, 80K, and 180K connections. Obviously, the quality 
	of each version improves as the amount of data increases.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Since the SolarMax 2000 site is 
        meant to reach a mass Internet audience, any broadband content needs to 
        be scalable so as not to turn away potential visitors. The streaming video 
        fulfilled this primary need, while providing broadband visitors with better 
        quality video.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Broadband-Only Sites</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Due to the relatively small number of 
        current broadband users, there are only a few examples of museum sites 
        created specifically for that audience. In the commercial realm, Quokka.com 
        (<a href="http://www.quokka.com/">http://www.quokka.com</a>) has developed 
        a reputation for providing Web-based broadband content. Other sites such 
        Intelís Web Outfitters (<a href="http://www.intel.com/">http://www.intel.com</a>) 
        also provides a few content sites geared toward visitors with high-speed 
        connections (and faster processors). These sites and others are free to 
        pursue what is at the moment a &quot;niche&quot; market. Museums for the 
        most part, with a mission to serve the public at large, have so far not 
        pursued the emerging broadband market. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>High-Bandwidth, Low-Bandwidth </b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Museums have created broadband sitesóbut 
        have been careful to include low-bandwidth versions as well. A recent 
        example is the Virtual Smithsonian (<a href="http://2k.si.edu/">http://2k.si.edu/</a>), 
        whose high-bandwidth version utilizes a variety of interactive and multimedia 
        technologies. The low-bandwidth version, not surprisingly, uses these 
        technologies much more sparingly. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">While creating two versions of the 
        same site is one way to insure that a site can reach all visitors, there 
        are some drawbacks. Some broadband visitors may still choose to visit 
        the low-bandwidth version anyway. Many visitors with slower connections 
        may feel that they are missing out by not being able to access the more 
        media-rich, high-bandwidth versions. Also, some new users of the Internet 
        might not know the difference between high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth 
        and may not know which choice to make.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Another significant drawback is 
        the development time required to produce these sites. Obviously, creating 
        two versions requires additional time. Also, there are more time requirements 
        and costs involved in updating and maintaining two sites. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Broadband sites themselves generally 
        use more interactive technologies such as Java (a platform independent 
        programming language) and/or Shockwave or Flash (interactive animation 
        and multimedia authoring programs). To develop using these technologies, 
        specific technical expertise is required. Hiring or contracting a Shockwave 
        or Java programmer or a Flash animator can be very expensive. The cost 
        of developing a high-bandwidth site can be much more expensive than creating 
        a low-bandwidth version.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">With all of these drawbacks, developing 
	multiple versions of sites is sometimes the only way to adequately present 
	the content. In 1998, I developed an online exhibit entitled, "<A HREF="http://www.exploratorium.com/memory/magnani">A 
	Memory Artist</A>"</span><span class="normal"> This exhibit contains drawings 
	and paintings created by artist Franco Magnani and photographs by Susan 
	Schwartzenberg. The paintings and drawings are of a small town in Tuscany 
	and are done entirely from memory. The exhibit compares these works of 
	memory with actual photographs of the same scene. In order to compare 
	these images, each one needed to be large enough so that viewers could 
	adequately observe the details. Also, each image needed to appear on the 
	same screen. Those unable to view the exhibit or unwilling to wait for 
	the images to download were given the option to view the text article 
	(which contained fewer images).</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The "Memory Artist" exhibit utilizes 
        JavaScript, which is a language developed by Netscape that allows Web 
        authors to add interactivity to pages. A simple Java script was used to 
        create a pop-up window. This was done to maximize the amount of screen 
        "real estate" available. The pop-up window removes the browser tool bars, 
        thus providing the extra necessary space. Some older versions of browsers 
        either don't support JavaScript at all or don't fully support it. Users 
        of these browsers are unable to access the pop-up window that contained 
        the exhibit. Instead, these users were given the option of visiting the 
        text article. In 1998, when the exhibit was posted, about one-quarter 
        of visitors to the Exploratorium site used browsers that didn't fully 
        support JavaScript. If we could have found another more inclusive method 
        of appropriately presenting the content we would have pursued it.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">To a certain extent, the "Memory 
        Artist" exhibit automatically detected the capabilities (although certainly 
        not the bandwidth) of visitors, providing them with the "exhibit" that 
        best suited them. More complex "auto-detect" scripts can tell if visitors 
        have multimedia capabilities by detecting browser types and versions, 
        as well as plug-ins (which expand the multimedia capabilities of browsers). 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">A Web visitor provides this information 
        to every site he or she visits. Auto-detection can make the user's experience 
        more seamless, providing fewer choices and directing visitors toward multimedia 
        technology that their computer is set up to handle. One example of an 
        auto-detect script at work is the Exploratorium's "Which Embryo Is Human?" 
        exhibit. (<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/embryo/">http://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/embryo/</a>). 
        An auto-detect script checks the browser version, sending visitors to 
        the JavaScript version or the non-JavaScript version automatically.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">While multimedia capabilities can 
        be automatically detected, the method is not foolproof and it cannot detect 
        the speed of the visitor's connection. Such a development would certainly 
        simplify the creation of multiple versions of sites. As the gap between 
        broadband Web users and dial-up users continues to grow, a method for 
        detecting the speed of a visitor's connection becomes more desirable. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">It's certainly possible such a development 
        could come to pass in the near future. Perhaps, in fact, browsers will 
        be able to communicate with servers in the way the RealPlayer doesóby 
        letting them know what type of connection they have. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Broadband Extensions</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Considering the problems that exist 
        in developing multiple versions of sites, perhaps the best method for 
        designing sites is to create sites that are flexible and contain scalable 
        media elements. These elements may scale automatically (like some streaming 
        media) or the user can select different versions of media files. In other 
        words, the structure and some of the contents of sites are available to 
        everyoneóbut some of the individual media files may require or work best 
        with broadband connections. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Providing the visitor with choices 
        for high-bandwidth or low-bandwidth media (or other components) means 
        the overall structure of the site can be inclusive (and one version), 
        while video, audio, images, and even interactive components can be scaled. 
        These components would be one "click away" from the general structure 
        of the site. Another benefit of this approach is the amount of flexibility 
        it provides. Low-bandwidth visitors can easily browse the overall structures 
        keying in areas of particular interestóif they are willing to spend the 
        time downloading a high-resolution image or a large video file. Or they 
        may view a "low-res" version, and then decide to view the higher quality 
        one.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">As we've seen, streaming video (both 
        Webcasting and "on-demand") provide a scalable solution that doesn't require 
        the visitor to have to choose between versions and, importantly, doesn't 
        require extra work for the developer. QuickTime video (generally a "non-streaming" 
        high-quality digital video standard) and images cannot be "automatically" 
        scaled. Different versions of these files would need to be created. Links 
        to these files would be offered as choices to visitors. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Thumbnail images linking to high-resolution 
        images have been used extensively on the Web for many years. The visitor 
        can make the choice to view the larger image; generally the size of the 
        image is listed, letting the users know what they are getting into. Broadening 
        this to include the option of viewing even larger images with more detail 
        is an obvious extension. In the museum world, visitors could view super-high-resolution 
        artwork or scientific illustrations. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">This technique can also be extended 
        to audio or video. Streaming audio is already "scalable," but other audio 
        file types and QuickTime video are not. It's easy to provide the user 
        choices between high-quality or low-quality versions of the same clip. 
        Creating additional versions of these files does require extra work and 
        extra file management and storage. However, creating and editing the clip 
        is usually the most time-consuming aspect of audio or video production. 
        Saving different versions of the clip is easy and having a high-quality 
        version provides more "value" for the time invested in creating and editing. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Sometimes "non-streaming" audio 
        or video can also be used as a high-quality alternative to streaming media. 
        One example of this technique is "Life Along the Faultine," a Web site 
        which I helped design for the Exploratorium. The article on Loma Prieta 
        (<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/faultline/loma_prieta">http://www.exploratorium.edu/faultline/loma_prieta</a>) 
        uses RealVideo and QuickTime to present news footage from the 1989 San 
        Francisco earthquake. The RealVideo is scaled so that broadband visitors 
        see better quality video than dial-up users do. The QuickTime versions 
        allow broadband users to view even better quality video (low-bandwidth 
        visitors can still download the clips, but it takes some time). All Web 
        visitors, regardless of connection type, can still read the article and 
        view the imagesómany of which are "clickable" to higher quality versions. 
        The structure of the site is as flexible as possible, providing the user 
        with options for interacting with video and images.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">As I mentioned, creating different 
        versions of media files does require more work on the part of the developer 
        (with the exception of G2 RealVideo files). But compared to the amount 
        of time involved in creating two versions of a site, the costs are minimal. 
        Having these "broadband extensions" in place provides more options to 
        current visitors and ensures that future ones will be able to view or 
        interact with higher quality files. It should be mentioned that variations 
        of this model are found in many places on the Web. In many ways, it's 
        a common-sense approach. You build a structure that is completely accessible 
        and then provide choices for visitors, offering content that takes advantage 
        of new technologies only when it's the best way to present the material.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The model I've presented doesn't 
        allow for "immersive environments." These are sites that create "virtual 
        spaces" on the Web. These types of environments are created using interactive 
        technology such as Java or, more often, Shockwave for navigation and the 
        "building" of the space. Such tools can provide compelling navigation 
        systems and interesting "spaces" for exploration, but the sites lack flexibility 
        for low-bandwidth and "low-tech" visitors. Even if some of the contents 
        of the sites could be "usable" for visitors, they need to meet the technical 
        requirements of the navigational structure (the Shockwave plug-in and 
        broadband connection) for visitors to view or interact with the contents.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Developing these immersive environments 
        can require a considerable amount of resources. Space is important, but 
        with limited museum resources it makes sense to focus on the exhibits 
        or other content. Good Web design (just HTML and images), may not provide 
        the visitor with as powerful an experience as an immersive environment, 
        but good design can create "space" as well, and in most cases it is more 
        functional, and it is always more accessible. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">As the number of potential users 
        with broadband connections increases, museums need to find compelling 
        ways to reach them. As I've mentioned, some commercial sites already cater 
        to these visitors, and certainly more sites will follow. If museums ignore 
        broadband visitors, they risk losing many of them to more compelling experiences 
        elsewhere on the Web. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">At the same time, focusing too much 
        energy on broadband visitors can be dangerous. With limited resources, 
        museums need to focus on creating resources that are flexible and inclusive. 
        The Web by its very nature is an "exclusive" environment. According to 
        "Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide," a report by the 
        "National Telecommunications and Information Administration" (<a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fttn99/">http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fttn99/</a>), 
        more than half of the U.S. population, particularly poor urban and rural 
        individuals, do not have access to the Internet. Obviously, creating additional 
        barriers such as bandwidth restrictions or the use of emerging technologies 
        further reduces your reach.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">There is a real tension between 
        creating compelling resources that take advantage of the latest technologies 
        that the Web offers and reaching the public-at-large. Museums should be 
        places where experimentation and innovation take placeóbut they also need 
        to reach their audiences. In addition, the realities of limited resources 
        and few online revenue models for museums can't be ignored.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The challenge for developers is 
        to balance these competing needs and not be carried away by all the hype 
        surrounding the broadband revolution. Common sense, compelling design, 
        and thoughtful uses of new technologies can provide rich experiences for 
        online visitorsóregardless of their connection speed.</span></p>
