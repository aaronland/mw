        Online/On-site Exhibition</b></p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p align="JUSTIFY" class="small">In September of 1999 the Minneapolis 
	  Institute of Arts "MIA" opened an eight-week exhibition, &quot;A Masterwork 
	  Restored&quot; allowing the public to observe the process of restoring 
	  a 300-year-old painting. Unique to this exhibit was not only the visitors 
	  on-site access to the physical restoration of the 12' x 7' masterwork, 
	  but the opportunity for the public to view the "real time" progress 
	  of the project on the web. Conceived as an on-site/online project from 
	  the beginning, this was the first project of its type to be composed 
	  of collaborators from different departments and organizations within 
	  the museum. The resulting web program "Restoration Online" (<A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org/restoration_online">www.artsmia.org/restoration_online</A>) 
	  became one of the most popular projects to date. This paper will describe 
	  the process of developing this site, the factors that led to its success 
	  and the perspectives of the primary participants.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>History and Conception</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Over the last decade The Minneapolis 
        Institute of Art's Interactive Media Group (IMG) has produced over a dozen 
        award winning educational multimedia programs for installation in the 
        museumís galleries. With the development of the museumís web site in late 
        1993, the IMG explored the development of a wide variety of online educational 
        units and resources for teachers and students. Through the internal and 
        external recognition for these successful projects and the curator's personal 
        interest utilizing interpretive technology, the Restoration Online project 
        was born.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">During a casual meeting in the spring 
        of 1998 the Instituteís Paintings Curator Patrick Noon described an idea 
        for a unique eight week exhibition focusing on the restoration of a very 
        large 17th Century Italian altarpiece <i>The Immaculate Conception with 
        St. Francis of Assis and St. Anthony of Padua</i>, by the artist Giovanni 
        Benedetto Castiglione. The painting had been in the museumís collection 
        for over 30 years and was in serious need of both structural and cosmetic 
        conservation. Because of the paintingís scale and the publicís interest 
        in the process of art conservation, Noon was very interested in securing 
        a gallery space in which the restoration could take place as an alternative 
        to the smaller conservation laboratory. He was also interested in finding 
        a way to utilize the museumís web site to promote and document the project. 
        This concept was also of great interest to the IMG staff, as it would 
        allow them to develop their first online exhibit tied directly to an ongoing 
        on-site exhibition.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Exhibition Planning/Development</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Soon after the Restoration projectís 
        exhibit and gallery were approved, a number of exhibition planning meetings 
        were held where the on-site and online aspects of the exhibit were introduced 
        and discussed among the exhibition planning staff and conservators. During 
        these initial meetings the online aspect of the project was still widely 
        misunderstood. Most of the staff had little or no point of reference for 
        such a project other than the online promotion of previous exhibitions. 
        Since the needs of both the on-site and online components overlapped in 
        a number of areas, strategies were developed to re-purpose and share information 
        and graphic resources as efficiently as possible. Plans were made to coordinate 
        the work of the designer developing the didactics for the gallery with 
        the graphic requirements for the online component. Plans were also set 
        in place for collecting and developing the curatorial and conservation 
        information to be used in the exhibition.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Because the exhibition focused upon 
        an ongoing, developing restoration process, the text and images for both 
        the online and on-site exhibits needed to be designed to accurately interpret 
        the events as efficiently as possible. Two methodologies were developed 
        to address this need. The curator and conservators identified images and 
        generated text describing the standard steps in painting restoration and 
        the known history of the work of art itself. At the same time, more dynamic 
        systems were developed for visually documenting the process and generating 
        up-to-the-moment text throughout the duration of the exhibition. These 
        systems depended heavily upon technologies that were not commonly used 
        in on-site exhibitions. </span> </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Digital methods</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">A number of new tools and techniques were 
        incorporated into the exhibit process allowing for the efficient, cost 
        effective documentation of the ongoing process including digital still 
        and video cameras, as well as a non-linear video editing system. The commercial 
        quality digital still camera proved to be one of the most indispensable 
        tools, allowing the MIA's staff photographers to shoot and "process" images 
        on a ongoing basis. These digital images were transferred to, organized 
        and archived on an internal shared server where both the IMG and the Design 
        department could easily access them for gallery and online applications. 
        An IMG Multimedia Specialist used an industrial quality, digital video 
        camera to document the process as well as to conduct ongoing interviews 
        with the curator and conservators throughout the duration of the exhibition. 
        These video segments were then inserted into and appended onto a dynamically 
        changing video program using the IMG's non-linear digital editing system. 
        A computer-based "webcam" was also installed in a fixed position with 
        the gallery space to provide documentation of the overall process. The 
        high quality, low cost and efficiency of all of these digital systems 
        provided for a uniquely flexible production environment that could respond 
        any time an opportunity presented itself. Each time a portion the painting 
        was changed or a discovery was made, detailed audio and visual documentation 
        could be quickly generated.</p>

      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>Configuring the in-gallery &quot;webcam&quot;</i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>The On-site Exhibit</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The on-site exhibition took place 
        in series of special exhibition galleries off of one of the museum's main 
        corridors. The space consisted of a small introductory gallery, a larger 
        exhibition space and a video viewing room. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Upon entering the introductory gallery 
        visitors had the opportunity to study a large reproduction of the unrestored 
        painting, a panel describing the scope of the exhibition, a panel devoted 
        to the history of the artist and the painting, and some preparatory sketches. 
        Immediately off of the introductory gallery was a video viewing space 
        containing benches and a 30" video monitor. The short video program shown 
        in this space was designed to provide an up-to-date overview of the restoration 
        process, including the paintingís deinstallation from the gallery, laboratory 
        x-rays, and transport into the adjacent exhibition gallery. In addition, 
        the program contained a general outline of the restoration process. This 
        outline was designed from the onset to allow documentation of the actual 
        process to be inserted into the program as the project restoration progressed. 
        The video program was run on a repeating loop during public museum hours 
        to present the prior steps in the process to current museum visitors and 
        to provide more life to the exhibit for those visitors viewing the painting 
        when the conservators were not present. This same video program was also 
        made available through the project's web site and will be discussed in 
        more detail in the online section of this paper.</span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The Central exhibition space was divided 
        to provide public space as well as a partitioned work area for the conservators 
        and the painting. Didactic text, graphic and photographic panels wrapped 
        the walls of most of the public space. These didactics included an outline 
        of the steps in the restoration process, schematic diagrams of the paintingís 
        physical structure and x-rays of areas of damage and earlier restoration. 
        One wall contained a set of numbered procedural panels designed with spaces 
        reserved for images of the completed steps or phases in the restoration 
        process. An iMac computer was installed on special counter with two chairs 
        in one corner of the public area. This computer provided access to the 
        online portion of the exhibition using a Netscape web browser running 
        in kiosk mode. The computer served to both extend the available project 
        information within the gallery as well as to market the fact that the 
        ongoing project could be viewed and followed from any computer with internet 
        access. </p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">For most of the conservation treatment 
        the painting was placed on a large movable easel in the center of the 
        partitioned conservation space. Special lighting was installed and a power 
        lift was used to assist the conservators in working on the huge painting. 
        A small railing was installed to keep the visitors at a safe distance 
        while allowing them to be close enough to view the detailed work of the 
        conservators and ask them questions. Gallery benches were placed on the 
        public side of the railing to allow visitors to sit comfortably while 
        observing the progress of the restoration. Museum docents and volunteers 
        were stationed in the gallery during heavy traffic periods to assist the 
        conservators in answering the many questions posed by the visitors. </p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Both the conservators and the docents

        access in-depth answers to commonly asked questions and to follow the 
        project beyond the visitor's on-site gallery experience. Colorful bookmarks 
        promoting the related online exhibition were made available throughout 
        the exhibition. Demand for these bookmarks was so high that they needed 
        to be reprinted three times during the length of the exhibition.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Designing Online Exhibit</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The online exhibition was created 
        with three goals in mind: 1) to provide an online version of the events 
        and information for visitors who arenít able to attend the on-site exhibition; 
        2) to provide extended information about the painting, the subject of 
        art conservation, and the restoration process; and 3) to document and 
        archive the process for later reference and educational applications. 
        In order to achieve these goals a great deal of preparation and planning 
        needed to take place prior to the onset of the exhibition.</span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">After reviewing all of the didactic 
        materials to be produced for the gallery, interviews were scheduled with 
        the two senior painting conservators Joan Gorman and David Marquis who 
        would be executing the restoration. Both of these conservators work for 
        the Upper Midwest Conservation Association (UMCA), a non-profit regional 
        conservation laboratory located within the MIA's building. The focus of 
        these interviews was to elaborate upon the physical history of the painting 
        being restored and the details and a timeline for the conservation process. 
        Interviews were also held with Paintings Curator Patrick Noon and Assistant 
        Curator of Paintings Susan Canterbury to identify key resources related 
        to the history of both the painting and the artist. The information gathered 
        in these interviews was combined with existing didactic information to 
        provide an overall structure for the online program. A prototype of the 
        structure and design of the program was developed and then reviewed and 
        approved by both the conservators and curators before proceeding with 
        production of the final program. The resulting program was made up of 
        five main sections: an intro or homepage; the Daily Log, Life of this 
        Painting, and Frequently Asked Questions, What's Wrong with this Painting?.</span></p>

      <p class="heading"><b>The Project Homepage</b></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="sayre.fig6.jpg" width="288" height="151"></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>The Restoration Online Homepage</i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The projects homepage was designed to 
        serve a number of purposes: to introduce the overall project, to promote 
        the on-site exhibition, to describe the importance of art conservation 
        in the MIA's mission, and to provide basic information about the Upper 
        Midwest Conservation Association. Users could choose to pull-up "live" 
        webcam images of the painting being restored, view "before and after" 
        images of other recently restored MIA paintings or link out to UMCA's 
        web site to find out more about this independent association. Along the 
        bottom of the homepage were links to the main sections of the site, represented 
        by photographic icons of the conservators and curator.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Daily Log </b></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="sayre.fig7.jpg" width="288" height="154"></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>The &quot;Daily Log&quot; section</i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">One of the most dynamic sections of the 
        site, the Daily Log, provided users with a virtual journal of the day-to-day 
        progress of the project. The Daily Log contained photographic images, 
        notes, video segments and a glossary which were generated on a daily basis 
        by Multimedia Specialist Mike Dust, who was also producing the ongoing 
        video documentation of the project. A customized set of templates was 
        developed using Alaire's Cold Fusion software to facilitate the efficient 
        maintenance and expansion of the Logs content. These templates aided in 
        managing the "expanding book" metaphor with a minimal amount of additional 
        markup. Each afternoon, Dust would review the days events with the conservators 
        and browse the images shot by the MIA Photo Services department. He would 
        then use the information and images to compose sometimes lengthy log entries 
        describing first-hand the most recent progress and discoveries. Dust would 
        also include links to the webcam and other sections of the site where 
        he felt they to be helpful.</p>

      <p class="heading"><b>Whatís Wrong with this Painting</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="sayre.fig8.jpg" width="288" height="152"></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>The &quot;Whatís Wrong with this 
        Painting&quot; section</i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">"What's Wrong with this Painting" presented 
        viewers with detailed information on the painting's technical problems. 
        The section was designed to look like a series of manila folders containing 
        text, photos and illustrations. Documents such as condition reports and 
        proposed treatment procedures which are normally not accessible to anyone 
        other than conservators and curators were available (in an edited form) 
        within these folders. Other folders contained x-rays of the painting, 
        photos and descriptions of damaged areas, interactive schematic diagrams 
        examining the physical construction of a painting and a glossary. Most 
        of the information in this section was gleaned from interviews with the 
        conservators and through interactive enhancements to the didactic gallery 
        information.</p>

      <i></i> 
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>The &quot;Life </i>of this<i> Painting&quot; 
        section</i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Upon entering the "Life of this Painting" 
        section, the user is presented with a timeline from the 16th century to 
        the present . The timeline contains both text and imagery and is interactive. 
        By clicking on centuries or decades, the user can walk through time exploring 
        key events that hold a direct relationship to the painting being restored. 
        The methodology is designed to expand the visitorís context for the restoration 
        by highlighting items such as the life and travels of the artist and painting, 
        technological developments in conservation and related art historical 
        events. The paintingís curators and conservators generated the information 
        contained within this section. Members of the IMG further enhanced this 
        information through additional research.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="sayre.fig10.jpg" width="288" height="157"></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>The &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; 
        section</i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The "Frequently Asked Questions" section 
        was designed to serve as a catch all for the numerous questions posed 
        by the public throughout the exhibition. The public was invited to submit 
        new questions to the conservators via an online form. IMG staff members 
        managed the process of collecting and posting the responses to these questions. 
        In order to get a jump on the anticipated barrage of questions; members 
        of the IMG staff surveyed friends and colleagues about questions they 
        had about the conservation project in advance of the exhibition. The two 
        dozen questions collected in this initial survey allowed the conservators 
        and curators to answer the majority of the common questions before the 
        exhibition began. The existence of these initial questions and related 
        answers also gave online visitors a greater perception of on-going interaction 
        between the museum and its public. Throughout the duration of the exhibition 
        the conservators and docents found this section of the program indispensable 
        for addressing repeat questions.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Public Response to the Exhibit</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The publicís response to both the on-site 
        and online restoration exhibits was overwhelmingly positive. The uniqueness 
        of the exhibition and the warm and engaging personalities of conservators 
        drew large with many repeat visitors. At times, weekends in particular, 
        the number of interested visitors slowed the conservators progress with 
        many questions and insightful discussion. Attendance was constant throughout 
        the duration of the exhibition with from a half dozen to one hundred visitors 
        observing the ongoing process at any one time.</p>
      <p align="center" class="normal"><img src="sayre.fig11.jpg" width="288" height="199"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>Visitors observing the ongoing restoration 
        in the gallery</i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">After a number of discoveries, the most 
        significant being the discovery of Castigliones's overpainted signature, 
        a number of dedicated "groupies" emerged. The conservator's felt that 
        the level of the publicís personal access to the project gave some visitors 
        a special sense of ownership in the project. Gallery conversations showed 
        that these enthusiastic visitors made regular visits to both the online 
        exhibit as well as to the gallery. The "Daily Log" and webcam were found 
        to be the most useful in remotely following the project. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">User statistics for the MIA's web site 
	(<A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org/">www.artsmia.org</A>) in which the project 
	site is located, increased dramatically over the duration of the project. 
	From the date of the exhibits opening to its close, user session more 
	than tripled to over 2000 users per day. The majority of these online 
	visitors were accessing the Restoration Online exhibition. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Even within the exhibition gallery, many 
        visitors spent time further exploring the project using the web kiosk. 
        The kiosk had advantages over the print-based didactics since it offered 
        a historical overview of the project from its beginning with dozens of 
        detailed photographs and notes. Graphics and diagrams which were static 
        on the gallery didactics were interactive in the online program. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>A school group and docent visiting 
        the exhibit</i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">School children were particularly interested 
        in the idea that the exhibit could be visited through the internet. Even 
        though very few tour guides and teachers permitted students to use the 
        kiosk in the gallery, many children responded enthusiastically when told 
        about the web site. Most children left with a promotional bookmark in 
        hand, some expressed excitement over the opportunity to visit the online 
        exhibit at home with their parents.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>The Conservator's experience</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">While the museum staff and many of the 
        visitors had a significant amount of experience with both web and interactive 
        multimedia educational programs, the UMCA painting conservators had very 
        little of these experiences personally or professionally. They were accustomed 
        to working in a quiet, private laboratory setting with little or no interaction 
        with visiting public. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The prospect of executing a large-scale 
        restoration of a major painting in public was provided enough unusual 
        challenges, never mind having a computer kiosk in the gallery with them. 
        And while they were very cooperative in providing extensive amounts of 
        information for the online portion of exhibit, both were concerned that 
        the media would not be flexible enough to document all the unpredictable 
        twists and turns in the treatment process.</p>

      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>Conservators discussing their work 
        with the curator</i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Once the conservators had viewed 
        the prototype for the online program, both began to see the possibilities 
        this new technology provided for illuminating an important yet predominately 
        unknown technical aspect of the museumís operations. As conservator Joan 
        Gorman states "... we felt ownership in the site to a degree. Here was 
        the project, the information we imparted to you (IMG) - but wow! It was 
        interesting, visually compelling, fun even." And as the project continued 
        to unfold their concerns related to the flexibility of the technology 
        diminished. During one phase of the project the painting had to be taken 
        off view for a number of days to be spray varnished. In this instance 
        the technology proved to be unexpectedly flexible as the webcam allowed 
        gallery visitors to remotely view the painting as it was worked on in 
        the well ventilated conservation laboratory.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Throughout the duration of the gallery 
        exhibition the conservators grew more and more enthusiastic about the 
        site. They were amazed by what they saw as the "overwhelming response 
        of the public to the web site" and the technologiesí ability to make information, 
        like the discovery of the artists signature, available to the world almost 
        instantaneously. At times when the painting was face down or difficult 
        to view, the conservators found it useful to direct visitors to the kiosk 
        to see what was currently not visible in the gallery.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">By the conclusion of the gallery 
        exhibition both conservators had been in their own words "converted" by 
        the educational potential of the web. Gorman summarized "... the web is 
        a wonderful tool, accessible to a very wide audience, an extension of 
        the project (and long after the project was complete), and a good marketing 
        device. To this day I refer people to the site to see our work. It affords 
        an informed, easy to use means of accessing a complicated subject like 
        conservation. In a very real way, the web site de-mystifies conservation, 
        one of my great goals as a conservator."</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Both conservators see the field 
        of conservation as slow to embrace new technologies, particularly for 
        educational purposes. The positive response they have received from their 
        colleagues over the online aspect of the project may begin to change that. 
        The "Restoration Online" site was featured on the front page of the American 
        Institute for Conservationís web site. With this type of professional 
        recognition and the positive aspects of the project's visibility, the 
        field is positioned for change.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>After the Exhibition</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">As the exhibition drew to a close 
        and the newly restored painting was rehung many UMCA and MIA staff members 
        began to debate what would become of the online project. The museumís 
        docents and education staff had become quite fond of the web site as a 
        means to explain the "behind the scenes" process of art conservation. 
        The museum's web site statistics were at an all time high. The Restoration 
        Online site was finally flushed out to the point where it could tell and 
        illustrate the entire process of restoring a painting from beginning to 
        end. An entire educational program had been dynamically created in real-time. 
        Was this the end or just the beginning?</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">With this continued interest mind, 
        a proposal was made to the Museumís Director Evan Maurer to permanently 
        install the &quot;Restoration Online&quot; program in the museumís permanent 
        collection galleries. An existing media space in close proximity to the 
        restored painting was freed-up to accommodate the final program. Didactics 
        from the exhibition gallery where the painting was restored were reinstalled 
        in the media space and a panel was written to describe the programís connection 
        to the nearby painting. To complete the connection, an extended label 
        was written for the painting which described its recent restoration and 
        directed visitors to the educational program.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Meanwhile, on the museumís web site, 
	the Restoration Online program was given a permanent position as an online 
	exhibition. The program continues to attract a great deal of attention 
	and in February, 2000 was reviewed as a wonderful web site for children 
	on the <i>Surfing the Net with Kids</i> (<a href="http://www.surfnetkids.com/">www.surfnetkids.com</a>) 
	web magazine.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Summary/Recommendations</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The &quot;A Masterwork Restored&quot; 
        exhibition and the &quot;Restoration Online&quot; web site were both highly 
        successful. Part of the reason for this was the subject matter itself. 
        Art museums rarely find opportunities to present live, production related 
        exhibits, something the general public is often starved for in museums 
        full of static objects. The first goal of extending project through an 
        online resource proved to be crucial to the projectís success as subject 
        matter was presented through interactive online materials contributed 
        the popularity of the project.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Beyond the subject matter itself, 
	the tandem formatting of online and on-site exhibitions mutually benefit 
	from their own cross marketing. The projectís initial goal of providing 
	an online version of events and information for visitors who werenít able 
	to attend the on-site exhibition was expanded as on-site visitors went 
	to the web to keep up on the project while online visitors become interested 
	in the real thing and were drawn to the museum.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The third and final goal set for 
	the online project was to document and archive the restoration process 
	for later reference and educational application. This goal was achieved 
	immediately when the program was permanently installed in the museumís 
	galleries. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Unfortunately, static online exhibitions 
	related to static on-site exhibitions are less able to compete with the 
	continuing intrigue of more dynamic ones. Online, on-site or both, the 
	success of this project begs the question &quot;Why donít art museums 
	do these types of exhibitions more often?&quot; And the answer is &quot;We 
	should.&quot;</span></p>
