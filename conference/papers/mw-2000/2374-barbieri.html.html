	Evaluating the Effect</span></b></p>
      <p class="author"><b>Thimoty Barbieri, and Paolo Paolini, Politecnico di 
	Milano, Italy</b></p>

      <blockquote> 
	<p class="small"> Webtalk-I is a powerful tool that allows creating Virtual 
	  Reality three-dimensional worlds, in which people can meet, by means 
	  of an Internet connection. Each one of the virtual visitors can remotely 
	  explore the Virtual world. In addition a virtual visitor can examine 
	  and interact with components of the world. Like in a real world situation, 
	  a visitor can see where the other visitors are currently located, where 
	  they are going, and what they are doing. Visitors exchange opinions 
	  or information with other visitors, using the keyboard. Visitors can 
	  interact with 3D objects, sharing the experience of the interaction 
	  with other visitors. An experimental application of Webtalk-I was presented 
	  last year during the closing plenary of MW99. It consisted of a reconstruction 
	  of a virtual museum, based on the Milan Science Museum, in which visitors 
	  could operate Leonardo's machines. 
	<p class="small" > After extensive testing, the environment, called "Virtual 
	  Leonardo" was officially opened to the public on June 7, 1999, in an 
	  extended and debugged version. We tried also some experimental virtual 
	  guided tours (one during ICHIM 99), with interesting results in educational 
	  terms. In this paper we evaluate the results of the first 6 months: 
	  how many visitors we had, what they did, the problems they had, the 
	  suggestions they gave us. Based on this experience is the design of 
	  the new WebTalk-II platform, currently under development. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b class="heading">Cooperating in Virtual Spaces</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The great part of museum web sites offer navigation 
	paths called "virtual tours". In the simplest cases, these tours are in 
	reality a collection of web pages, organized in a logical sequence, which 
	offer a sort of guide to the museum. To exploit more fully the possibilities 
	of multimedia technologies via the internet, another common approach is 
	to provide 3D environments which the cyber-visitor can navigate freely. 
	These environments are very often QuickTime VR shoots which can be viewed 
	with a standard plug-in. While this approach can convey a minimal feeling 
	of 'being there', several questions arise on this approach. First of all, 
	the task of guiding the visitor is left to the content of the web page 
	itself. Moreover, the visitor has no notion of other visitors which may 
	be more experienced and with which he could exchange ideas or comments, 
	quite a common scenario during a visit to a real museum. Secondly, not 
	always mimicking the reality of the museum is the winning choice in presenting 
	the museum contents. One can exploit the freedom from the chains of physical 
	reality, and represent in electronically recreated worlds what would be 
	nice to see in the real museum, but the constraints of physics prevent 
	to do. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Supporting cooperation between users during web 
	browsing is not such a new idea anymore. Several players in the Internet 
	arena have by now realized that surfing web sites is one of the few activities 
	that is still experienced alone. The net offers a number of chat-boxes 
	and virtual communities which are more or less unrelated to an underlying 
	web site (Active Worlds, <a href="http://www.activeworlds.com/">http://www.activeworlds.com</a>; 
	Blaxxun Colony City, <a href="http://www.colonycity.com/index.html">http://www.colonycity.com/index.html</a>; 
	Ultima Online, <a href="http://www.owo.com/">http://www.owo.com</a> ). 
	This approach often lacks a real referencing system to already existing 
	web contents with a complex structure. We have thus a good 3D cooperation 
	system, but a weak link to any existing web site. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"> Recently it is possible to see efforts to support 
	cooperation between users visiting the same web site, or even the same 
	web page. These approaches usually get to the user via NetMeeting (allowing 
	audio and video links with a pre-arranged rendezvous on a given server), 
	or use special plug-ins to integrate into the web site the typical chat 
	functionalities and cooperation patterns of cyber communities. There is 
	still a lot of 'bidimensional thinking' in these solutions, and as a consequence, 
	cooperation is clumsy and indirect. It is only the learned familiarity 
	of the users with the list-of-users and colors-of-different-meanings metaphors 
	that make the system work (Hypernix Gooey, <a href="http://www.gooey.com/">http://www.gooey.com</a> 
	). Here we have a fairly tight link to web contents, but a poor cooperation 
	system (or at least less imaginative than it should be), cast in a 2D 
	frame.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We are convinced that an interesting solution will 
	combine 3D Virtual Communities techniques with 2D web site structures. 
	Collaboration is supported within the museum environment by any 3D representation, 
	augmented with a 3D access structure to the museum's web site contents. 
	This is the underlying philosophy of the WebTalk-I and WebTalk-II projects 
	at Politecnico di Milano.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">With WebTalk-I, you can draw the museum environment 
	in 3D, and decide the position of the exhibits inside it. You can specify 
	for every object the actions that may be performed on it (click it, drag 
	it, rotate it, light it, hit it). You can also decide if the effects of 
	these actions are to be seen only by the actor, or you can make them shared, 
	that is the effects are seen by all the people which are navigating the 
	museum space in that same moment. You then define the links that allow 
	to jump from the 3D space to the related 2D web page. For example, clicking 
	on an info billboard next to a huge 3D mechanical clock, pops up the web 
	site page related to the clock. While you walk in the 3D museum, you see 
	all the others in the form of avatars, little human figures. This way 
	it is very easy to see at a glance how many people are viewing the same 
	information (space) you are, and what each user is doing in every single 
	moment. This is because 3D is the metaphor we use everyday to cooperate 
	in real life. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">3D spaces allow to use a whole different set of 
	rules for cooperation. An immediate advantage is the possibility to create 
	'special users' which can function as guides or clerk assistants, and 
	guide other users (in groups or one by one) to the visit of the site. 
	These guides can be driven by humans, can be automated agents with artificial 
	intelligence, or can be robots which follow pre-recorded tours.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Technically speaking, WebTalk-I uses the VRML97 
	language to represent the 3D shapes, and the Java language for the communication 
	engine with other users. These are two internet standards, so users should 
	not have problems installing the necessary software to experience the 
	virtual collaborative museum.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Our first goal was to apply these ideas to a real 
	museum, creating a suitable 3D environment. We approached a museum with 
	an existing website, to cooperate and with sufficient exposure. This is 
	how Virtual Leonardo started its days on the web.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Virtual Leonardo: evaluating effects and reactions</b></p>
      <p> <span class="normal">You can enter Virtual Leonardo from the main page 
	of the National Science Museum in Milan (<a href="http://www.museoscienza.org/">http://www.museoscienza.org)</a>. 
	The environment represents rather faithfully the inside of the cloister 
	of the monastery which houses the museum. From the cloister you can enter 
	different rooms, and each room contains a 3D version of a machine inspired 
	by Leonardo's drawings. These machines almost never worked in reality. 
	In Virtual Leonardo, they appear in full scale and fully functional. While 
	the real museum offers some wooden working models that can be operated 
	by the museum staff, the virtual museum shows you what is not possibile 
	to recreate in reality, and allows you to touch whatever you want.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Among the available machines there is the famous 
	Aerial Screw, the Pulleys, the Lagoon Dredge, the Parachute, the Pile 
	Driver. Beside each machine you can click on the info billboard to jump 
	to the related web page of the museum.</span></p>
      <p><img src="picture1.jpg" width="400" height="379" alt="Figure 1"></p>
      <p class="caption"><i>Figure 1: Four users (three in sight, and one viewing 
	the scene) are looking at the Aerial Screw flying. They have been reading 
	the explanations provided by Leonardo's avatar, and they are ready to 
	click on the billboard to read the related page.</i></p>
      <p><img src="picture2.jpg" width="400" height="321" alt="Figure 2"></p>
      <p class="caption"><i>Figure 2: Linking 3D space with the related 2D web 
	page, it is possible to be guided by somebody else to discover information 
	you might have overlooked following 2D links or using a keyword search 
	all by yourself.</i></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The server went live on June, 7<sup>th</sup> 1999, 
	and it is still running at present. There is generally free admittance 
	to Virtual Leonardo, and everybody is allowed to connect and visit at 
	any time. However, from time to time an expert from the museum staff might 
	organize a virtual guided tour, using an avatar shaped in the form of 
	Leonardo himself. This way, he can lead the cyber-visitors to a 3D tour 
	with an explanation of the machines. Nobody really needs to be at the 
	museum to do this, not the visitors nor the guide. A virtual tour was 
	successfully demonstrated at MW99 and at ICHIM'99, where the virtual guide 
	led the audience around to the discovery of Virtual Leonardo.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In six months (between Jun, 7<sup>th</sup> and Dec, 
	31<sup>st</sup> 1999), the system itself was hit <b>1547</b> times. This 
	figure includes all trials to get connected, even by people who didn't 
	have the proper software installed. Successful connections by people who 
	managed to start the virtual system numbered <b>501</b>. This was more 
	or less expected, as loading a page with VRML graphics and a Java program 
	has more requisites than a simple web page, and the user has to be prepared 
	in advance. Even if there is an installation page in which is clearly 
	stated what is needed to run Virtual Leonardo, most people give it a try 
	all the same, even without the proper software installed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The total contiguous time spent by all users in 
	Virtual Leonardo was <b>6,975</b> minutes, which is approximately <b>116</b> 
	hours. The visitors have spent an average of <b>14 </b>minutes per visit, 
	and the maximum connection time with a user reached <b>304 </b>minutes, 
	that is around <b>five </b>hours.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We classify connections under 2 minutes as failed 
	(since in average it takes a couple of minutes to load the system), and 
	connections between 2 and 10 minutes as unsatisfying, because such a short 
	period probably indicates that no cooperation or very little cooperation 
	has occurred between the user and the other participants in the museum. 
	This usually means that the user did not find anybody to interact with, 
	just strolled around a bit and then disconnected. This leads us to a primary 
	rule: cooperation mechanisms work as long as there is somebody else to 
	cooperate with. Trivial as this might sound, great effort has to be spent 
	to keep the cooperative environments populated. The majority of cyber-communities 
	play on the sense of personal ownership. They let you build or rent some 
	virtual space, so you connect often to look at your building or piece 
	of virtual space.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">A virtual museum should offer guided tours led by 
	an expert at predefined times, attracting visitors willing to learn something 
	in an innovative and entertaining way. It is this technique, together 
	with continuous updating of contents and simplicity of use, that brings 
	<i>satisfying connections </i>(above 10 minutes) into the system.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Virtual Leonardo got <b>148 (30%) </b>failed connections, 
	<b>251 (50%)</b> unsatisfying connections, and <b>102 (20%)</b> satisfying 
	connections. Unsatisfied users kept the connection open for an average 
	of <b>5.5</b> minutes, while satisfied users have been online with the 
	system for an average of <b>53.5 </b>minutes. Such a difference in connection 
	times stresses again the primary rule of cooperation: when there <i>is</i> 
	somebody else, the system works and keeps you on for almost one hour.</span></p>
      <p><img src="picture3.jpg" width="400" height="253" alt="Figure 3"></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><i>Figure 3: The bar diagram shows average 
	connection times between unsatisfied and satisfied users. The satisfied 
	users stay connected </i>way<i> longer!</i></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Even if this is a bad thing to do (for privacy reasons), 
	we logged all conversation, and we observed that conversation in the museum 
	is always sparse, like "hello, anybody in here", or "where are you?", 
	or "how do I make this thing work?". This changes completely when there 
	is a guide leading a tour and moderating conversations. In this case the 
	topics were often focused on Leonardo, on flying principles, and on the 
	'Last Supper'.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Another interesting observation stems from the data 
	gathered on the different type of actions. In broad lines, a user can 
	<i>move </i>his avatar, <i>use</i> an object, or type a line of <i>chat</i>. 
	During the observation period, the users generated <b>105,049 </b>events, 
	of which <b>5% </b>were caused by chatting, <b>26%</b> by playing and 
	touching the exhibits, and <b>69% </b>by moving around the virtual space.</span></p>
      <p><img src="picture4.jpg" width="400" height="264" alt="Figure 4"></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><i>Figure 4: The diagram breaks out the 
	types of events in Virtual Leonardo. There has been a lot more walking 
	than talking!</i></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This has both technical and natural reasons. Technically 
	speaking, the system does not make a good optimization of movement events, 
	overloading both the network and the logged data. On the other hand, it 
	is true, also from personal experience and from direct observation of 
	other people using the system, that in general one is more concerned with 
	moving and exploring than typing messages. Secondly, moving and typing 
	proved awkward, and in the end most of the users just chose to move around 
	and spare the talking. This has only in part to do with the difficulty 
	of coordinating mouse movements and keyboard typing. It has been observed 
	in other Cooperative Spaces with vocal communication systems, that movement 
	in virtual space and using the movement commands reduces intercommunication 
	(Ellis). Moreover, a problem which has still to be solved in a satisfying 
	manner is coordinating vocal communications within a large group without 
	creating confusion. Probably the one-liner chat metaphor is still the 
	best solution at the moment.</span></p>
      <p CLASS="heading"><span class="normal">Lessons Learned and Future Work</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Observing the users reacting to the system, and 
	collecting their praise and their complaints, has been of great importance 
	to define the growth path of our project.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The general idea worked and attracted visitors. 
	The museum staff was thrilled to have the possibility to discuss Leonardo 
	with working models in full scale, and to the broadest audience possible 
	Ò the world.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The problems, however, are still many:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">Technical issues proved to be an insurmountable 
	  barrier for less experienced users.</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">It is difficult to add contents to the 3D museum, 
	  because it requires a person proficient in VRML programming and not 
	  just a modeler. This leads, in the end, to two parts of the web site 
	  to mantain, the 2D part and the 3D part, with the 3D part lagging behind.</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">In general, one needs more people at the site 
	  at the same time. As this is not always possible, it is important to 
	  supply automated guides or pre-recorded paths to follow, in order to 
	  allow cooperation at least with the robots if not with other people. 
	  </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">The user interface could be greatly enhanced, 
	  and could support a richer set of cooperation possibilities.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">It is absolutely necessary to remove technical difficulties. 
	While it is true that the users' interest in cultural content might help 
	them endure several glitches of the system, by eliminating the technical 
	problems the audience can become broader and the cooperation more effective. 
	This is why the new system will drop VRML and go for an all-Java solution 
	which will work outside the browser. The users will install a dedicated 
	program, and the environment will be automatically installed, just at 
	the price of double-clicking the 'Setup' icon. Using Java, we will also 
	be able to read in 3D shapes written in any technique the museum designer 
	might choose, be it VRML, 3D Max, X3D, Lightwave, etc. Whatever new standard 
	will appear in future, it will be just a matter of adding a new part of 
	the program to load it in.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The link to the existing museum web site could be 
	made tighter or looser. There are two possible strategies to follow here. 
	You could re-create a completely different version of the web site in 
	3D, duplicating the authoring efforts and mantaining in fact two websites 
	instead of one. This could be the way to follow if the 3D portion of the 
	site has different contents which can be shown effectively only in three 
	dimensions. In this case a tight link to existing 2D content is not needed, 
	even if it could be implemented and used, and the final result is not 
	much different from other Virtual Communities on the web, except maybe 
	that the content is cultural and not focused on idle chatting. You could 
	provide a 3D shell on a web site which already exists and has a carefully 
	designed structure (possibly described with HDM). The 2D web site could 
	also be generated dynamically from an hyperbase of web contents using 
	another technology developed by the HOC Laboratory, the JWEB system. The 
	WebTalk system could then let you choose for the site a different implementation 
	of the same access structure, which uses 3D environments and metaphors. 
	The use of 3D gives the same web site the ability to be navigated cooperatively: 
	you could log in the entrance room, to find a guide in the form of an 
	avatar (linked to a human operator or an automated agent). The guide can 
	lead groups to web pages they might have never discovered without the 
	advise of an expert on the subject. During this navigation, it is very 
	important to provide the user with the most intuitive interface possible. 
	A 2D map might represent the navigation in space to help the user locate 
	other visitors or the guide. Special 3D spots or conveyor-belts<i> </i>might 
	be followed in the space to go to important sections of the museum. Hyperspace 
	jumps and hyperspace bookmarking facilities might be provided. Once you 
	reach a specific area, you could jump to the related portion of the conventional 
	web site. Again, the key here is that the 3D representation could map 
	the existing web site by providing an access structure which is logically 
	the same, but augmented with cooperation possibilities (I follow somebody, 
	somebody follows me÷) difficult to represent in 2D.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Cooperation possibilities might take many different 
	forms. We are defining <i>cooperation elements</i>: small rules that decide 
	what an user can do with other users and with the system. We are then 
	going to combine the elements in sets, called <i>cooperation metaphors</i>. 
	The designer of the 3D web site can decide which cooperation metaphors 
	are to be linked to groups or single users. For example, he might decide 
	that the museum can be visited only by guided groups (<i>rule: groups 
	are preformed and need a guide</i>), and that talking to the guide is 
	allowed but not talking between the group participants <i>(rule: intergroup 
	communication forbidden)</i>. These rules, set in this fashion, might 
	be grouped in a metaphor called <i>Restricted Guided Tour</i> and assigned 
	to all users incoming from 1 PM to 6 PM, when a human operator is available 
	for guided tours. Many cooperation rules can be envisioned and we are 
	formalizing them in a chart.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">All these ideas will be part of the new platform, 
	WebTalk-II (<A HREF="http://webtalk.elet.polimi.it/">http://webtalk.elet.polimi.it</A>), 
	of which a running prototype is expected towards the end of the year.</span></p>
