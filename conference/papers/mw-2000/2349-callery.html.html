      <p class="author"><b>Bernadette G. Callery and Robert Thibadeau, Carnegie 
	Mellon University, USA</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
	<p class="small">Visitors to modern museum exhibitions see only a limited 
	  number of objects selected from the collections. With only limited label 
	  copy available, it can be difficult for the visitor to understand the 
	  object in the context of the scientific, artistic or cultural theory 
	  presented in the exhibition. What happens when the visitor wants to 
	  know more? How can museums offer the original documents of discovery, 
	  the raw material of research, to the museum visitor and the World Wide 
	  Web user? Carnegie Mellon University Libraries, the School of Computer 
	  Science at Carnegie Mellon University and the Carnegie Museum of Natural 
	  History are collaborating to develop the prototype of a Smart Web Exhibit 
	  (SWE) designed to deliver information online, on target and on time, 
	  to a diverse user community. Visitors will view digitized archival material 
	  drawn from signature collections at both institutions. Users of the 
	  SWE will select material based on their level of interest (basic curiosity, 
	  generally informed interest, or detailed technical interest) or the 
	  amount of time they want to spend. Both onsite and online users will 
	  have the option of viewing a choice of pre-selected online exhibits 
	  of this material or searching the online collections by the materials' 
	  type, keyword or subject terms. The University Librariesí SWE will provide 
	  access to photographs, correspondence, lecture notes and published and 
	  unpublished papers of two early innovators in computer science, Herbert 
	  Simon and Alan Newell. The Carnegie Museum's SWE will display unpublished 
	  field notes, correspondence, photographs, published popular and scientific 
	  articles dealing with the Museum's early paleontological discoveries, 
	  especially that of <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i>. Challenges and compromises 
	  of the initial stages of this collaborative project are discussed.</p>

      <p class="heading"><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Visitors to modern museum exhibitions see only a 
	limited number of objects selected from the museum's collections. Since 
	the late nineteenth century, when the concept of the "index" museum was 
	proposed by J. E. Gray of the British Museum (Natural History) and promoted 
	by W.H. Flower of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, 
	many public museum collections have been divided into those items selected 
	for exhibition and a much larger research collection that is not usually 
	available to the public (Stearn, 1981). In an index museum, selected typical 
	specimens summarize the whole of a collection in a relatively small space, 
	as it was felt that the museum's large collections organized for scientific 
	study, with their masses of unique, but related objects, would bewilder 
	and tire the public. Museum visitors, unaware of the existence of these 
	separate research collections, may assume that the entire holdings of 
	the Museum are on permanent display. Collections of archival material, 
	including correspondence, photographs and other records dealing with the 
	acquisition and use of the museum's objects, are less known than the research 
	collections themselves, as the visiting public seldom sees any archival 
	material on display. Moreover, unless the formation and development of 
	the museum's collection is the subject of the exhibition, there is little 
	information in most exhibition label copy to indicate when and under what 
	circumstances a particular item was added to the collection or the context 
	from which it was taken. This research explores the idea that the box 
	office appeal of seeing the &quot;real stuff&quot; in museums could be 
	strengthened by access to the collection records and the related documentation 
	that supports the evidence for that reality. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Proponents of the New Museology, as summarized by 
	Stam (1993), emphasize the value of the museumís information base and 
	suggest that the wider availability of information about the acquisition 
	of collections is a way of fulfilling the social responsibility of museums. 
	Those who see the museum visit as an interactive educational encounter 
	such as Falk (1992) and Hooper-Greenhill (1994) emphasize the need to 
	present contextual information about the cultural materials exhibited 
	in museums as this context provides a basis for the visitor to make a 
	connection with the content and concepts of the exhibition. Hooper-Greenhill 
	(1994) speaks of the development of museum education programs, from the 
	early part of the twentieth century when "curators struggled to establish 
	museums as places where important objects were collected and cared for" 
	to the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, when new ways of communication 
	were developed using "discovery galleries, interactive exhibits and new 
	relationships to new audiences." The display of and possible interaction 
	with "real objects" has considerable power when viewed in the social situation 
	of a museum visit. Museum visitors want to see some reflection of themselves 
	in an exhibit. While not all museum visitors will have gone on a field 
	expedition, many can relate to the theme of exploration. With the proposed 
	Smart Web Exhibits (SWE), museum visitors will be able to view both the 
	mounted specimen in the museum gallery and the correspondence and field 
	photographs related to that specimen, sharing in the tedium of fruitless 
	exploration and the excitement of actual discovery. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The development of the Smart Web Exhibits will explore 
	a portion of the larger research question that asks what criteria museum 
	visitors apply in choosing one exhibit over another. Experimental variables 
	that the project hopes to isolate and test through the end user interface 
	will include the level of interest as indicated by the visitor and the 
	amount of time the visitor wants to spend looking at the exhibit. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Responding to the expectation that museums will 
	provide access to information about their collections via their websites, 
	this project plans to provide information through web-based kiosks on-site 
	in the museum's exhibition galleries and on the museum's and the library's 
	websites. The University Librariesí SWE will provide access to photographs, 
	correspondence, lecture notes and published and unpublished papers of 
	two early innovators in computer science, Herbert Simon and Alan Newell. 
	Web access to the congressional papers of U.S. Senator John Heinz is already 
	available on <A HREF="http://heinz1.library.cmu.edu/HELIOS">Carnegie Mellon 
	University's site</A> and will serve as a model for the Simon and Newell 
	papers. The Carnegie Museum's SWE will display unpublished field notes, 
	correspondence, photographs, published popular and scientific articles 
	dealing with the Museum's early paleontological discoveries, especially 
	that of <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i>. Evaluation techniques will be designed 
	to explore the differences in the visitorís queries and other uses of 
	the information system depending on whether they are onsite in the galleries 
	or searching the collection information via the website. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">While the popularity of behind-the-scenes tours 
	of the museum's research collections suggests that visitors are interested 
	in seeing more of a museumís collections, the specific research questions 
	asked in this project include</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">Do museum visitors want to know more about exhibited 
	  objects? </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">How can this additional information be organized 
	  and presented for the visitor's use?</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">What type of background and contextual information 
	  would visitors select, such as correspondence or photographs, if given 
	  a choice?</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">How can archival documents be organized for presentation 
	  as an adjunct and online exhibition? </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">How does online use of these adjunct archival 
	  materials differ from their onsite use, particularly in frequency of 
	  selection?</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">Do online visitors spend more time searching 
	  for and viewing this associated archival material than onsite visitors?</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">What amenities, such as a separate seating area 
	  or a separate, sound-insulated space within the galleries, would increase 
	  use of this material onsite?</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">With funding from the Institute of Museum and Library 
	Services, Carnegie Mellon University Libraries, the Carnegie Museum of 
	Natural History and the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon 
	are collaborating to develop, document and disseminate prototypes of Smart 
	Web Exhibits. Smart Web Exhibits (SWE) are designed to deliver information 
	online, on target and on time to a diverse user community. The typical 
	museum exhibition is a distillation of information gathered from many 
	sources, including the correspondence of collectors, the records of acquisition, 
	the dry bones of scientific description and subsequent publication - all 
	part of the raw material from which the curatorial narrative of exhibitions 
	are derived. Using the SWE, museum visitors will have direct access to 
	this material. Like the user selecting material from the library catalog, 
	the museum visitor may select material from the SWE to supplement the 
	museum's exhibits. Visitors may either follow the suggested trails of 
	an online exhibition or strike off on new ones of their own choosing by 
	searching the document base on the basis of keyword, an individual's name 
	or some other specific term. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Telling the Story</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Vannevar Bush (1945) wrote that "a record, if it 
	is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be 
	stored and above all it must be consulted." Museum exhibitions are a form 
	of record and represent the choice of curators, educators and exhibition 
	designers to present the curatorial narrative. With the Smart Web Exhibit, 
	we are combining the traditional selection of quality materials with access 
	to the raw materials of scholarship, including unpublished manuscript 
	sources that have been inaccessible and seldom included in exhibitions, 
	except by reference. In the SWE's display, transcriptions of handwritten 
	letters will accompany the page images, creating a self-documenting exhibition 
	label. By including easily accessible original documents in the information 
	base organized by the SWE, we are diversifying the voice of the exhibition. 
	The Smart Web Exhibit goes on beyond the label copy by including the writings 
	of those directly involved in discovering the objects displayed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The SWE extends the museum exhibition, allowing 
	the visitor to see the full text of the selected article or manuscript 
	letter or the field photograph or video, not just the index terms in the 
	catalog and the bibliographic entry for the retrieved text. The desirability 
	of this immediacy of access is favorably noted by Gurian (1991). </span></p>
      <blockquote class="normal"> 
	<p>We understand that not everyone wants the same additional information, 
	  but the individual who does want more information wants it then and 
	  there. Immediate access to information is satisfying to the audience; 
	  therefore the task is to provide information in the exhibition in a 
	  manner such that the audience knows it is available without being intrusive.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">To tell the story of early paleontological discoveries 
	at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, we are creating a curatorial 
	narrative by using the actual documents which recorded those discoveries. 
	The inclusion of the extensive correspondence between the museum's administrators, 
	scientists and field collectors, the required field expense reports and 
	the photographs capture the museum's side of the story. Clippings from 
	local newspapers and early scientific articles interpreting the discoveries 
	add the popular and scientific dimensions. The complete text and illustrations 
	of the first scientific publication describing the Carnegie's signature 
	dinosaur, <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i>, is already available online and 
	can now be put in context along with the correspondence between the Museum's 
	director and the field collectors. This work was scanned as part of the 
	celebration of the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of its discovery and is 
	available at the Antique Books site (<a href="http://www.antiquebooks.net/library.html">http://www.antiquebooks.net/library.html</a>) 
	For background on the Antique Books project, see Thibadeau and Benoit 
	(1997). The online scrapbook approach has been tested on the Museum's 
	website, with the slideshow "This is your life, <i>Diplodocus Carnegii</i>" 
	(<a href="http://www.clpgh.org/cmnh/exhibits/dippy/index.html">http://www.clpgh.org/cmnh/exhibits/dippy/index.html</a>). 
	Picture books of field photographs, recording actual field activities 
	of the Museum's recent collecting seasons, are a popular feature of the 
	Museum's simulated dinosaur dig, the Bonehunters's Quarry (<A HREF="http://www.clpgh.org/cmnh/bonehunters/index.html">http://www.clpgh.org/cmnh/bonehunters/index.html</A>). 
	These albums continue the tradition of documenting the discoveries and 
	field preparation of fossils, as well as the perils and pleasures of modern 
	camp life.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In designing a museum exhibition, the earliest, 
	and the most influential decisions involve the choice of audience for 
	whom the exhibition is intended and the point of view or bias used in 
	selecting and connecting the items used. Lavine (1991) questions the ability 
	of an exhibition to maintain a single voice, given the evolution of scholarship 
	within a discipline and the resultant divergence of voices and views. 
	He suggests that different types of exhibitions have different modes of 
	presentation and organization, noting that "exhibitions of social history 
	are driven by interpretive ideas and are usually organized as narratives. 
	As a result, objects are not made the primary focus of exhibits but retain 
	significance as corroborative evidence." Providing the museum visitor 
	with a choice of layers of information "of successively greater depth 
	and detail" is one technique used by museums in providing diversity of 
	information about the objects and ideas presented in their exhibitions. 
	MacDonald (1991) notes that "Diversity is the key to a museum fulfilling 
	its role as an information provider in the service of society." The Smart 
	Web Exhibits may be one technique for providing those alternate voices.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Labels - What Do Visitors Want To Know? </b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Museum exhibition labels are the most evident types 
	of the passive information sources provided to museum visitors. George 
	Browne Goode (1895), writing on museum administration from the vantage 
	point of assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, recognized 
	the positive value of labels, noting "an efficient educational museum 
	may be described as a collection of instructive labels, each illustrated 
	by a well-selected specimen."</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Like many other aspects of museum exhibition technique, 
	fashions on the length of labels have changed. Serrell (1996), whose writings 
	on the nature and extent of the museum exhibition label are widely referred 
	to, is quite firm on the length of the label, noting that &quot;all types 
	of labels should be kept as brief as possible.&quot; She does recognize 
	that there are other types of interpretation, which can be used to inform 
	and engage the visitors, ranging from handouts to extensive exhibition 
	catalogs. "Videos, audio tours, computer databases and demonstrations 
	by staff can provide other means and modes of presenting information and 
	interpretation. All of these supplementary forms of interpretation will 
	allow interpretive labels on walls or in cases to remain brief, as they 
	should be.&quot; Gurian (1991) also mentions the "branching programs" 
	of interactive videodiscs as a means of bringing additional information 
	to the user without cluttering up the walls of the exhibition.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In selecting material for exhibition, as well as 
	the label information accompanying them, curators and designers are guided 
	by Serrel's warning (1996) &quot;The museumís mandate to present information 
	must be tempered by a responsiveness to what visitors are interested in 
	and capable of receiving and processing."</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Organizational Stratagies</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The focus of the early phase of the Smart Web Exhibit 
	project will be to develop techniques for matching the visitor to the 
	material available. This may be done by beginning with the documents and 
	identifying individual documents as being of interest to a visitor with 
	a particular level of interest. Another technique would be to begin with 
	the visitor, as in the typical library catalog search, allowing the visitor-as-user 
	to search documents for keywords of interest to them. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">One technique of categorizing the visitor's level 
	of interest would be to include this information in the coding of the 
	documents. One possible approach to the conditional interpretation of 
	documents would be to organize them in hierarchical type trees as is normal 
	with collections. Documents would be labeled as described in Thibadeau 
	(1996) and the labels then formatted in XML format and manipulated using 
	advanced XML scripting as described in Thibadeau, Balderas, Snyder, and 
	Nestor (1999). Similar systems have been built for books at the National 
	Academy Press (<a href="http://www.nap.edu/">http://www.nap.edu</a>) and 
	World Resources Institute (<a href="http://www.wri.org/">http://www.wri.org</a>), 
	for wide-ranging materials including videos (<a href="http://www.ulib.org/">http://www.ulib.org</a>), 
	and for art, art history, and architecture images at the Academic Image 
	Cooperative (<a href="http://www.academicimage.org/">http://www.academicimage.org)</a>. 
	</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Another method for matching the material and the 
	visitor would be to apply a technique under development at Carnegie Mellon 
	University Libraries. The Automated Reference Assistant (ARA) provides 
	basic reference assistance to remote users by suggesting subject-specific 
	reference tools based not only on the subject of the user's question, 
	but also on the level of information desired. In the proposed model, resources 
	are categorized as basic and advanced. If a user retrieves too many resources, 
	only the ones identified by the system as basic are presented. The user 
	may then request additional information, at which point the system provides 
	the full list, including both basic and advanced resources.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">One technique will follow the library search model, 
	using the organizational strategy developed for the HELIOS project (<a href="http://heinz1.library.cmu.edu/HELIOS">http://heinz1.library.cmu.edu/HELIOS</a>). 
	In this model, individual documents organized by traditional archival 
	finding guides are scanned, the digitized images are converted to searchable 
	text using Optical Character Recognition and the quality of the resultant 
	page images and corresponding texts verified. Information on the archival 
	organization of the documents is preserved and metadata is attached as 
	part of the scanning and verification process. User will be able to search 
	the material by noun phrases in the text or subject terms and limit the 
	search by document type or date. A list of proposed document types for 
	the Museum's collection is included in the appendix to this paper.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">One of the features of the HELIOS project used to 
	organize archival collections is its notion of "bundles." This is their 
	term for identifying groups of different formats of material fastened 
	together. Bundles are a technique which can be used to record the physical 
	relatedness of documents. By this definition, there are "bundles" in the 
	archival material supplied by the Carnegie Museum. In addition to maps 
	and other field sketches inserted in the body of letters and field reports, 
	there are attached photographs and the all-important field expense reports 
	and receipts from workmen. In the manner of television documentaries, 
	the text of the letters could be interrupted, and interpreted, by photographs 
	which illustrate the action described in the letter.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The strategy that follows the exhibition organizational 
	model is one in which the documents are grouped into thematic hierarchies. 
	Access to the content of the archival documents available via the Smart 
	Web Exhibit can be provided based on the userís expressed level of interest 
	similar to the selection made for a traditional on-the-walls exhibition 
	or in a less-structured way similar to that of users browsing a library 
	catalog. In the first mode, the archivist or curator designs a hierarchical 
	structure that categorizes documents into these exhibition schemes. In 
	the second, the users search for documents that match the search keys 
	that they have input.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In the case of the material dealing with the Carnegie 
	paleontological discoveries, one proposed structure dealing with the nature 
	of research in the field of paleontology is outlined below. Individual 
	documents will be slotted into these categories as well as being flagged 
	for the user's level of interest.</span></p>
      <p><img src="callery.fig1.gif" width="400" height="300"></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><i>Figure 1: Thematic organization of 
	archival material</i></p>
      <p class="normal">In all cases, one of the measures of the success of the 
	organizational and indexing strategies used in this project will be the 
	ability to read a collection of letters dealing with a particular field 
	discovery. The challenge will be to present these materials in chronological 
	order, regardless of how the actual documents may have been scattered 
	across different archival series or record groups. Here will be an opportunity 
	for the museum visitor to share in the excitement of discovery.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Identifying The User</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Without abandoning the added value of the curatorial 
	narrative, the SWE is designed to adapt to the user's expressed level 
	of interest. Serrell (1996) reports that the Denver Museum of Natural 
	History used discovery, exploration and study as the three levels of information 
	supplied to their visitors. The SWE proposes the following as its initial 
	categories of these levels of interest.</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">simple curiosity, distinguished by an emphasis 
	  on graphics</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">general interest, the museum's standard level 
	  of presentation</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">intense technical detail, including scientific 
	  papers with specialized vocabulary</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">It may be important to categorize users according 
	to the amount of time they have available to "view" the exhibit. The amount 
	of available time could be matched with the levels of interest by offering 
	a "highlights" tour for each interest level. Each set of highlights would 
	present items determined to be of interest at the appropriate level.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Demographic breakdowns by the age of the visitor 
	does not appear to be adequate - as age isn't necessarily an indicator 
	of level of interest. Level of interest could translate roughly into age 
	if need be, but documents would be identified as fitting into one of the 
	three levels of interest, that is, basic curiosity, informed interest 
	and technical interest. The basic curiosity material could include the 
	"high points" that we would include in one of the system-supplied "tours" 
	that would be in addition to user-selected searches.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Some mechanism would need to be developed to allow 
	users at any level to have the opportunity to see more than is initially 
	presented to them, by either searching the information base directly or 
	changing their stated level of interest.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Challenges And Compromises</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Largely due to maintenance considerations, the Museum 
	prefers not to use keyboards as input devices in the majority of its computer-based 
	exhibits, using instead trackballs to point to menu choices. This limited 
	form of user query may not be adequate as a mechanism to select search 
	strategies that take advantage of the textual richness of the archival 
	documents included in the SWE. It may be that two different user query 
	approaches will have to be developed -- one for the onsite user and one 
	for the offsite or Web-based user. Users of the non-keyboard interface 
	may lose subject access to much of the material unless some other sort 
	of navigational tools is developed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Members of the museum's education and exhibition 
	staff are concerned that all newly developed exhibits appeal at some level 
	to children. This will affect the identification of material and may necessitate 
	the construction of a "just-for-kids" mode, possibly with a separate user 
	interface.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The extent to which specimen-level data will be 
	provided is still undecided, as there is a long tradition of limiting 
	access to particular types of data, such as specific location information. 
	This type of sensitive information may simply be omitted from the public 
	display at all levels.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Other Aspects Of The Propsed Smart Web Exhibit</b></p>
      <p class="normal">Not discussed in this paper are the plans for the evaluation 
	of the user interface, the tools used to index and provide access to media 
	other than text or still images or the process for obtaining reproduction 
	rights to material under copyright. Links may be provided to other similar 
	resources outside the individual museum or library.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p class="normal">The Smart Web Exhibit project is still in the specification 
	and development phase. The challenge of providing information to a diverse 
	audience online, on target and on time, will be met in the coming year.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Appendix: Document Types In The Museum's Archival 
	Collection</b></p>
      <p class="normal">The proposed document types are based on past user queries. 
	Terms listed under each standard category are examples of documents that 
	might be encountered in the collection that would be included under the 
	standard category.</p>
