      <p class="heading"><b>Integration of Primary Resource Materials into Elementary 
        School Curricula</b></p>
      <p class="author"><b>Nuala A. Bennett, Beth Sandore, Amanda M. Grunden, 
        University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA<sup>, </sup>Patricia L. 
        Miller,<sup> </sup>Illinois Heritage Association, USA</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="JUSTIFY" class="small">The primary focus of the Digital Cultural 
          Heritage Community Project is the digitization of materials from local 
          area museums, archives and libraries for elementary gradesí social science 
          curricula. Using teachersí curriculum units and the Illinois Learning 
          Standards for direction, primary source materials are identified by 
          curators and librarians for inclusion in a digital repository. The repository 
          metadata must be complex enough to easily integrate the different forms 
          of metadata currently used by each institution, while, at the same time, 
          being simple enough for facilitation by the elementary school users. 
          Simultaneously, a collaborative agreement was developed to include a 
          set of terms and conditions for digital access to collections, the right 
          to distribute materials and permissions to host materials. We have thus 
          far learned that each school districtís interpretation of the state 
          learning standards necessitated additional review of local standards 
          to insure that the project addressed goals and objectives that were 
          pertinent on a local as well as a state level. Curators and librarians 
          have had to be innovative when choosing items to digitize, and teachers 
          must be able to make use of materials in imaginative ways, as it was 
          often apparent that there might not always be a good fit between curriculum 
          needs and the local area museum and library collections. Finally, we 
          are developing a set of guidelines and standards to enable the creation 
          of a consistent database, easily mapping between different controlled 
          vocabularies and organizational data.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Digital technology brings the potential 
        for museums, libraries, and archives to play an integral role in the enhancement 
        of learning by providing access to digitized primary and secondary cultural 
        resources as well as more traditional bibliographic and cultural materials. 
        The Digital Cultural Heritage Community Project (DCHC) (<a href="http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/dchc">http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/dchc</a>) 
        at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is an eighteen-month 
        project that commenced April 1999. The primary focus of the DCHC is the 
        digitization of materials from local area museums, archives and libraries 
        with the ultimate goal of enabling early and late elementary grade teachers 
        to integrate digital cultural heritage materials into the social science 
        curricula.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Access to the digitized materials 
        is available from the database on the DCHC Web site. The database is publicly 
        accessible, although its emphasis will likely encourage only those users 
        with an interest in Illinois social science issues. Our main user is likely 
        to be an elementary school teacher who will integrate the information 
        available on the database into his or her classroom activities.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Collaboration</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In order for any collaborative project 
        to be successful, there must be extensive cooperation among participants, 
        and it is no different for the DCHC participants. When the DCHC started, 
        collaboration involved several conference telephone calls, and extensive 
        use of a listserv. Observation and analysis of the listserv discussions 
        led us to believe that most participants were often more willing to respond 
        to specific directed questions rather than general discussions. It was 
        subsequently felt that some sort of threaded email package would be more 
        suitable to the project. We believed that the threaded email, by its very 
        nature, would help in the direction of discussions and lead to more specific 
        exchanges, thereby generating more feedback from all participants. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Using OíReilly Webboard<sup>TM</sup> 
        (<a href="http://webboard.oreilly.com/">http://webboard.oreilly.com</a>), 
        we set up a threaded email discussion board, which overtook the listserv. 
        The Webboard now allows us to follow specific lines of discussion much 
        more closely and enables us to much better understand our shared goals 
        for the project. There are many more levels of communication among participants. 
        Formal and informal messages can be kept apart and allow for better understanding 
        of project-related discussions. Similarly, people who are not interested 
        in a particular discussion now know that they need not follow it as closely 
        as they might another, and the Webboard allows them to distinguish easily 
        between all discussions. It also ensures that decisions about the project 
        need not necessarily be made by consensus among every single project participant, 
        but by those who are following a particular discussion more closely. Figure 
        1 is a screenshot of the Webboard, where the discussion topics are visible 
        in the left frame, and the details of one discussion are visible in the 
        right frame. Finally, the Webboard also allows us to admit a number of 
        outside advisors to particular discussions while also restricting their 
        access to other topics. This allows us to achieve additional insights 
        and information that can be very helpful to the project. </span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Equipment</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In order to fully participate in 
        the DCHC, each partner institution needed to have access to appropriate 
        hardware and software. Schoolteachers and partner institutions were given 
        the choice of receiving an Apple iMac or PC, based on their personal and 
        institutional preferences and familiarity with the two platforms. Teachers 
        tended to select iMacs, while the other partners opted for Dell PCs. Similarly, 
        each partner institution was supplied with a flatbed scanner or a digital 
        camera depending on preferences and existing equipment in their institution. 
        The Digital Imaging and Media Technology Initiative, where the project 
        is based, has large flatbed scanners and a batch processing slide scanner, 
        as well as digital cameras, all of which are also made available to the 
        project partner institutions for imaging.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">DCHC staff went to the schools and 
	institutions to set up their equipment, ensure its operability, and provide 
	rudimentary training on the use of the new hardware and software. Email, 
	phone, and regular additional visits to the schools and institutions provide 
	continued equipment support for the participants. A workshop aimed primarily 
	at those who would be doing the most digitizing from the museum, archive 
	and library partners was held on scanner and digitization standards. Participants 
	were introduced to scanner operation and the use of scanning utilities 
	and image manipulation software such as Adobe Photoshop (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/">http://www.adobe.com/</a>). 
	They also learned about resolution, color-depth, and quality indices as 
	well as calibration of scanners and monitors for optimal digitization. 
	During the workshop, decisions regarding the number and quality of digitized 
	images were discussed and it was agreed that the DCHC would follow the 
	general guidelines for digitization as presented by the Library of Congress 
	(Fleischauer, 2000) and using the Cornell University digitization formulae 
	(Kenney &amp; Chapman, 1996). This workshop helped to ensure that all 
	partners would be able to produce quality consistent images that would 
	be usable in the final database.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Curriculum Units</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The participant teachers in the 
        DCHC teach 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 5<sup>th</sup> grades in 
        East Central Illinois schools. They initially made available to all project 
        participants their lesson plans and curriculum units for social science. 
        There were no restrictions on the number or arrangement of curriculum 
        units, which each teacher would submit. Accordingly, there is much variation 
        in the type and organization of the combined units. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">As well as submitting their curriculum 
        units, the teachers included information about which of the Illinois State 
        Board of Education Learning Standards for Social Science (<a href="http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ils/standards.html">http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ils/standards.html</a>) 
        were covered within each particular unit. Although the individual school 
        districts can also develop their own specific learning objectives, they 
        all must conform to the broadly stated goals in the state standards. The 
        current Illinois State Board of Education Learning Standards were adopted 
        in 1997. The Learning Standards are statements that define a core of essential 
        knowledge and skills that all Illinois students enrolled in public schools, 
        elementary through high school, are expected to know and be able to do. 
        They are useful in many aspects such as setting uniform expectations of 
        all students, easing the transition of students who move from school to 
        school, and also providing a foundation for defining the knowledge and 
        skills that teachers need in order to provide instruction for students. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Initially, it was proposed that 
        the teachers would submit their curriculum units appropriate to the Illinois 
        Social Science Learning Goals 14-16, and then later submit the units for 
        Learning Goals 17-18. However, we found that the teachers were submitting 
        units, many of which covered several Learning Goals from 14-18, and the 
        distinction between the earlier goals and the later goals has now largely 
        been ignored. We have six detailed curriculum units for 3<sup>rd</sup> 
        graders, four units for 4<sup>th</sup> graders, and four units for 5<sup>th</sup> 
        graders, covering areas of social science such as &quot;How we learn about 
        communities&quot; (3<sup>rd</sup> grade) or &quot;French in Illinois&quot; 
        (4<sup>th</sup> grade). </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Combined with the curriculum units 
        and the corresponding Learning Goals, the teachers also suggested examples 
        of primary source materials that they might find useful in teaching each 
        particular unit. These materials were chosen by the teachers based on 
        their experience of teaching the units over the past several years and 
        their experiences of what items would be most helpful to the students. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Selection of Materials</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Based on their subsequent reading 
        and understanding of the curriculum units, social science learning goals 
        and desired primary source materials, the museum curators, archivists 
        and librarians delved into their collections to search for examples of 
        the types of materials that they believed the teachers would find most 
        useful if digitized for inclusion in a digital repository. There followed 
        much collaborative discussion between the teachers, curators, archivists 
        and librarians to achieve optimal content selection for the digital repository. 
        Final content selection was determined through this detailed and continuous 
        review process where the teachers together discussed the benefits of using 
        particular museum or library images for the curriculum units. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">It was at this point that we realized 
        how restrictive working with local area museums and libraries can be for 
        specific subject fields, such as social science. Local area museums tend 
        to obviously have collections that contain many items specific to a local 
        region. Although the teachers at elementary grade levels often teach local 
        interests, or how national topics might relate to local issues, their 
        main coverage in the social sciences tends to more national topics. Thus, 
        it would often happen that a teacher would initially like to see a digitized 
        image of a particularly national artifact, but might have to make do with 
        something that was much more local in nature. As well as the constraints 
        of geography in local museums and libraries, there is a constraint of 
        time periods as well. In particular, in Central Illinois, museums and 
        libraries tend towards collections from the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> 
        centuries. As a result, topics such as the Prehistoric Indians can be 
        difficult to cover.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Consequently, the museum curators 
        and librarians had to be particularly innovative in choosing items from 
        their collections. They had to choose items, which would be of use to 
        the teachers in class. More importantly, they had to be innovative in 
        convincing teachers of the use of particular items from their collections. 
        In one case, a librarian suggested that a teacher might find herbals useful, 
        whereas the teacher had never previously thought of such an artifact (for 
        a unit on Native Americans): The librarian explained that &quot;[t]hese 
        are early printed books, from the 1400's, 1500's, to the present, with 
        woodcut drawings of various herbal plants. These books were used by healing 
        practitioners to make herbal remedies. Obviously, the Indians were the 
        source for some of this invaluable information in the herbals written 
        in later centuries&quot;. The teacherís response was &quot;I have never 
        heard of herbals! I think it might be interesting to see what the writing 
        and woodcuts look like. We were just talking about shamans today in [4<sup>th</sup> 
        grade] class, and discussing how the willow bark used by Indians has the 
        same compound in it as aspirin&quot;.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Accessibility to Materials</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">While discussing the proposed content 
        of the database, the participants simultaneously determined the steps 
        necessary to make the content available to teachers and students, and 
        to create the digital repository that will be accessible through the project 
        Web site. In order to create an integrated system usable by each participant 
        institution, several issues are of major concern, particularly the metadata 
        that would be used for the database of images.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Metadata</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Firstly, the metadata must be complex 
        enough to easily integrate the different forms of metadata currently used 
        by each participant museum or library. There was a great range of metadata 
        formats in use among the participant institutions. The museum community 
        uses <i>Nomenclature for Museum Cataloging</i> (Blackaby,1995), as well 
        as also using tools such as the <i>Art and Architecture Thesaurus</i> 
        (<a href="http://shiva.pub.getty.edu/aat_browser/">http://shiva.pub.getty.edu/aat_browser/</a>). 
        The library participants, on the other hand, mostly use references for 
        Library of Congress name and subject headings and would have little or 
        no experience of museum methods. The first metadata issue of concern was 
        ensuring that each museum and library would be willing and able to merge 
        its existing content and metadata with the multiple other sources. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The metadata must, at the same time, 
        be simple enough to be easily understood by the participant elementary 
        school teachers and their students. We found that elementary school teachers 
        did not easily understand the concept of metadata, yet they were able 
        to discuss the metadata fields quite easily. Similarly, the museum curators 
        and librarians had different ideas about metadata, so we arranged a workshop 
        where the project participants came together and learned about metadata 
        from a basic standpoint to ensure that everybody had at least some basic 
        knowledge of the issues involved. The metadata workshop closed with the 
        participants agreeing that the museums, libraries and archives would continue 
        examining and utilizing the various digital file formats for access and 
        archival purposes, metadata (indexing and description) formats, and thesauri 
        that are used across the professions. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Following the metadata workshop, 
        lively Webboard discussions followed. Issues that were considered included 
        OCLCís Cooperative Online Resource Catalog (CORC) (<a href="http://www.oclc.org/oclc/corc/index.htm">http://www.oclc.org/oclc/corc/index.htm</a>) 
        and Dublin Core (<a href="http://purl.org/dc/index.htm">http://purl.org/dc/index.htm</a>), 
        both of which had been used extensively during the metadata workshop, 
        as well as EAD (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/ead/">http://www.loc.gov/ead/</a>) 
        and the creation of dynamically delivered HTML and Microsoft Active Server 
        Pages (MS-ASP)<sup> </sup>(<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/server/asp/ASPover.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/server/asp/ASPover.asp</a>) 
        using MS-Access or AltaMira Pressís PastPerfect<sup> </sup>(<a href="http://www.altamirapress.com/Pastperfect.html">http://www.altamirapress.com/Pastperfect.html</a>) 
        as a database source. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">CORC claims to be &quot;a state 
        of the art, Web based system that helps libraries provide well-guided 
        access to Web resources using new, automated tools and library cooperation. 
        It is a system of automated tools that can be used for the creation, selection, 
        organization, and maintenance of web-based resources&quot;. CORC was originally 
        restricted to about 100 libraries, but since January 2000, it has been 
        made available to all libraries. Although the DCHC participants spent 
        some time testing CORC, it was found to be unsuitable at the time for 
        this particular project because of the learning curve, which would have 
        been involved for the participants and also, the version of Dublin Core 
        utilized in CORC was not extensible enough to accommodate our needs. EAD 
        was similarly dismissed for this project, on account of the amount of 
        time it takes to train all participants and become totally familiar with 
        its complexity. Discussions with several people in the EAD community led 
        us to believe, given the combined experience and knowledge of our project 
        participants, that it would take too long for everybody to become sufficiently 
        knowledgeable about EAD to use it comfortably.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Dublin Core, on the other hand, 
        given its simple adaptability would be much easier for everybody to handle. 
        During the metadata discussions, it was agreed that DC would be the metadata 
        format that would be used, and we then set about finalizing the actual 
        DC fields and field descriptions for the DCHC. Dublin Core is a set of 
        fifteen elements, or fields that are intended for facilitation of electronic 
        resources. DC has several characteristics that made it ideal for the DCHC. 
        In particular, its simplicity enabled us to ensure that all project participants 
        had a grasp of the issues quickly and without too much difficulty. Its 
        semantic interoperability also made it a prime candidate among the project 
        users at several different museums and libraries, the focus of which can 
        be very diverse collections. Finally, its extensibility also allowed us 
        to provide a set of metadata elements that covered the many varieties 
        of project participant institution. In order to ensure uniformity of metadata, 
        we designed a database using the following set of fields, as closely related 
        to DC field names as possible, that we felt would cover as much of the 
        information as possible coming from the partner institutions.</span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The actual database was designed, 
        with the fields described above, using MS-Access 2000. Although several 
        of the participant museums use PastPerfect for their own local database, 
        MS-Access was chosen in preference to PastPerfect because it allowed greater 
        flexibility in the creation of unique fields and in building queries and 
        relationships that would be necessary for the types of searches and compilation 
        of database statistics that the project wished to produce. Also, as the 
        database grows, MS Access would allow easy transfer to a more robust database 
        such as MS-SQL.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">MS-ASP was also chosen because of 
        its cross platform capabilities and ability to integrate well with either 
        MS-Access or SQL should the database need to expand in the future. ASP, 
        as a server-side technology, affords greater speed and simplicity for 
        the end user than other scripting languages and is cross-browser compatible. 
        This allows greater access to the database by users of a variety of Web 
        browsing software, which is important given the variation in location 
        and ability of project participants. Additionally, the servers behind 
        the backbone of the DCHC were already able to support ASP development 
        without further modification or installation of proprietary server software.</span></p>

      <p class="heading"><b>Integration into Classroom Activity</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Primary source materials can assist 
        the teacher in enhancing the curriculum. It is well-known that the use 
        of primary source materials, as well as helping to alleviate boredom in 
        classroom settings, can also help to advance students to higher-level 
        thinking and it can offer experience of collecting, organizing, interpreting, 
        and weighing the significance of factual evidence to achieve a systematic 
        analysis of primary source documents. Students can compare and contrast 
        evidence from different sources and try to identify factual information 
        and separate it from opinion, and make justifiable inferences and conclusions 
        (Otten,1998), (West, 1996).</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The teachers who are participating 
        in the DCHC have the opportunity only once or twice a year to visit a 
        museum or library with their students. Being able to access the DCHC database 
        now allows the teachers and students to view materials held in many more 
        local area museums and libraries that they might not otherwise see during 
        the year. They have much more material at their fingertips, and teachers 
        are able to enrich the curriculum by effectively using the images in the 
        database during the course of their teaching a particular curriculum unit.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In parallel with on-line discussions 
        about the content and metadata for the database, we also held a number 
        of workshops to ensure that all project participants had sufficient knowledge 
        and skills to participate actively in all discussions, and more importantly, 
        to make use of the database of images and associated metadata in their 
        classroom settings. The first workshop on material culture, &quot;Integrating 
        Primary Resources into Teaching&quot;, proved very helpful to all participants. 
        Through hands-on activities, project participants learned valuable methods 
        for using primary sources to enhance the social studies curriculum using 
        images of authentic artifacts, documents, and photographs. In particular, 
        the elementary schoolchildren of Illinois can liven up certain topics 
        such as &quot;Government in Illinois&quot; by accessing images of items 
        such as judgesí robes that were used in famous court cases, or ballot 
        boxes that were used in elections in times gone by. Another advantage 
        of each workshop was that it gave participants a chance to meet face-to-face. 
        Communication was facilitated and improved after each meeting among participants.</span></p>

        ownership, and conditions of use. Museums and libraries together developed 
        a set of terms and conditions for digital access to their collections.

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">This agreement ensures that there

        information in digitized form. The agreement sets out in writing how to 
        make the digitized images, descriptive text and other media available 
        to participating institutions in formats agreed upon by all the participating 
        institutions and it confirms how works are selected for inclusion in the 
        project on the basis of a process agreed upon by the participating institutions. 
        The agreement also covers copyright issues, such as whose responsibility 
        it is to obtain permissions to digitize objects, and confirms that the

        to the state standards and there was little or no difference. In the case 
        of the second school district, the district learning standards were designed 
        to actually reflect what is covered in the classroom, and the teachers 
        believe that the state learning standards are not as comprehensive, and 
        are only later matched up with what is taught. The third district was 
        in the process of revamping its local standards and relied more heavily

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">While considering the state learning

        as a state level. In most cases, the local standards did allow for the 
        museum curators and librarians to find more innovative artifacts for the 
        students, and enabled broadening the scope of the search for items to 
        include in the database.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Innovation</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Secondly, as teachers made their curriculum 
        units available, it became clear that there might not always be a good 
        fit between curriculum needs and the local area museum and library collections. 
        In order to get over this stumbling block, the curators and librarians 
        must be more innovative when choosing items to digitize. In turn, teachers 
        must be willing and able to make use of materials with their students 
        in more imaginative ways. One example where this happened was a unit on 
        &quot;Communities and Geography&quot;, which a teacher used to cover items 
        such as rice-growing in China. None of the local area museums or libraries 
        had anything that remotely covered this industry in another part of the 
        world. However, one of the libraries did have an ox-yoke that was carved 
        by Lincoln. While the ox-yoke is of course important in the teaching about 
        Lincoln, it was also useful for the teacher to show an implement to the 
        children that might be used for rice-growing carried out in another land.

      <p class="heading"><b>Consistency</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Finally, we had to develop a set 
        of guidelines and standards for the museums and libraries to enable the 
        creation of a consistent database, easily mapping between different controlled 
        vocabularies and organizational data. Much discussion took place about 
        the type of database and metadata, which would be used for the images. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">It was particularly important that 
        we developed a consistent set of guidelines for every partner institution 
        entering data into the database. The fields in the database were based 
        on the Dublin Core fields, but due to the nature of the partners and their 
        collections, some adjustment of the original fifteen DC fields had to 
        take place. Almost none of the participants had worked with DC before 
        their involvement in this project, so it was imperative that very specific 
        guidelines were set out for all participants to enable their entering 
        data into the database without any difficulty and with complete consistency.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The DCHC is now halfway through 
        its anticipated lifespan. We plan to carry out more research into how 
        the teachers actually use the database images in their curriculum. We 
        would like to look at innovative ways in which teachers may further develop 
        their curriculum units using the database images which the museums and 
        libraries have made available to them. We need to carry out extensive 
        evaluation studies to ascertain how much use the database is actually 
        receiving from our local users as well as users from outside our immediate 
        locality. We are already closely monitoring use of the project Web site, 
        but need to analyze what users are actually doing at the Web site and 
        how they are using the database. We also have set up an Advisory Group 
        of eight experts from various fields and regularly avail of their advice 
        as to how we might improve upon the DCHC and perhaps expand it further 
        for the future.</span></p>
