      <span class="AbstractText">Access to cultural exhibits is a central issue 

      in museums and exhibition galleries that is recently approached under a 

      new, technological perspective. Although the cultural industries' practices 

      in the cases of museums and cultural exhibits have remained practically 

      unchanged for long, in recent years we are witnessing a gradual adoption 

      of media-technologies in various aspects, such as collections archiving 

      and digital document preservation, media- and Web-presentation, graphical 

      animations, etc. The advent of such technologies contributes towards providing 

      media-rich presentations of cultural exhibits and consequently offering 

      better services to museum visitors. Lately, Internet and Web-based technologies 

      have been employed for providing access, mostly to images of exhibited objects. 

      With current technology, such access is limited due to the non-interactive 

      nature of pre-recorded images or videos and the difficulty in constant updating 

      of the sites when there is change in the content. In few cases, the incorporation 

      of higher-end technology, such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, 

      or robotics, is explored. Some science museums, large &quot;edu-tainment&quot; 

      venues, and recreation parks have traditionally been the ones to embrace 

      new media first, by employing fascinating and sophisticated interactive 

      installations and presenting up-to-date results on the creative use of technology.</span><span class="AbstractText">In 

      this paper we present such an effort, the TOURBOT project, which emphasizes 

      the development of alternative ways for interactive museum tele-presence, 

      essentially through the use of robotic &quot;avatars&quot;. TOURBOT, an 

      acronym for TOUr-guide RoBOT, represents a collaboration between museums, 

      technology providers, and brokers of technology to museums. The overall 

      goal of TOURBOT is the development of an interactive tour-guide robot able 

      to provide individual access to museums' exhibits and cultural heritage 

      over the Internet. TOURBOT operates as the user's surrogate personna 

      (avatar) in the museum by accepting commands over the web that direct it 

      to move in its physical workspace and visit specific exhibits. In other 

      words, the imaged scene of the museum and the exhibits is communicated over 

      the Internet to the remote visitor. As a result the user enjoys a personalized 

      tele-presence to the museum, being able to choose the exhibits to visit, 

      as well as the preferred viewing conditions (point of view, distance to 

      the exhibit, resolution, etc).</span><span class="AbstractText">In addition 

      to remote interaction with the robot, TOURBOT can also act as a flexible, 

      on-site museum guide to visitors that are physically present. By interacting 

      with the tour-guide robot, museum visitors have the ability to individually 

      exploit the expertise stored in the robot, which can react flexibly to their 

      requirements. It can, for example, offer dedicated tours of specific focus 

      to exhibitions or alternatively give overview tours. As a side effect of 

      this concept, museum visitors get acquainted with new, cutting-edge technology 

      by easily interacting with a complex robotic system. Therefore, technological 

      advances are seamlessly assimilated in everyday activities. </span><span class="AbstractText">This 

      approach to cultural heritage access presents a high degree of novelty as 

      well as a number of technical and conceptual issues and challenges. This 

      paper discusses these issues while analyzing the expected benefits and expectations 

      from visitors, the community, and the museums. </span>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class=normal>The goal of this project is the development of an interactive 

        TOUr-guide RoBOT (TOURBOT) able to provide individual access to museums' 

        exhibits and cultural heritage over the Internet (TOURBOT, <a

href="http://www.ics.forth.gr/tourbot" target="new">http://www.ics.forth.gr/tourbot</a>). 

        TOURBOT operates as the user's avatar in a museum by accepting commands 

        over the Web that direct it to move in its workspace and visit specific 

        exhibits. The communication network is, thus, effectively extended by 

        the introduction of interactive, mobile robotic platforms as terminal 

        nodes. The imaged scene of the museum and the exhibits, is communicated 

        over the Internet to a remote visitor. As a result the user enjoys a personalized 

        tele-presence to the museum, being able to choose the exhibits to visit, 

        as well as the preferred viewing conditions (point of view, distance to 

        the exhibit, resolution, etc). TOURBOT is able to guide on-site museum 

        visitors providing either group or personalized tours.</p>

      <p class=normal>In order to realize the TOURBOT system, a multimedia Web 

        interface is created to allow people to interact with the tour-guide system 

        over the Internet (Schulz et al., 1999). An on-board interface also facilitates 

        interaction with on-site visitors of the museum. Using the Web interface, 

        people all over the world are able to tele-control the robot and to specify 

        target positions for the TOURBOT system. Camera controls are used to choose 

        the part of the exhibition the user wants to inspect in more detail. The 

        robotic tour-guide possesses a multimedia information base providing a 

        variety of information about the exhibition at various levels of detail. 

        Thus, the TOURBOT system essentially serves as an interactive and remotely 

        controllable tour-guide that provides personalized access to exhibits 

        with a large amount of additional information.</p>

      <p class=normal>A tele-operated interactive tour-guide robot requires a 

        high degree of autonomy since it operates in a populated environment in 

        which humans are also present. Therefore, the project includes the development 

        of a safe and reliable navigation system for TOURBOT (Trahanias et al., 

        1999; Fox et al., 1998; Argyros et al., 1999). The robotic avatar is equipped 

        with a series of state-of-the-art sensors that allow it to acquire information 

        about its environment. The navigation system uses this sensory information 

        to adapt the robot's internal model of the environment and to plan the 

        robot actions.</p>

      <h1>A New Paradigm in Access to Cultural Content</h1>

      <p class=normal>In the last couple of decades, museums have been evolving 

        their concept and have been setting new priorities and objectives that 

        follow a more global approach. Under this expanded approach, museums are 

        expected to actively and energetically seek (and please) a broader audience 

        (Ames, 1986). This signifies a change in the definition of the museum 

        "public", now expanded to include school children, the working classes, 

        minorities, individuals and groups with special needs. Changes of this 

        kind were taking place as early as the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, 

        when by opening the King's collections to the people, the primitive 

        idea of the museum open to the public was substituted with the one of 

        the museum belonging to the public (Poisson, 1950). With the advent of 

        technology, museums begun to look at new ways for providing access to 

        their collections and to their activities in general. Most museum technology 

        applications involve the creation of archives, libraries, image galleries 

        but also tools of virtual presentation of collections and 3D representations 

        (Thomas and Mintz, 1998). We have many examples of successful projects 

        presented on CD-ROMS, on-site kiosks, installations, and the Web, in a 

        variety of forms, ranging from simple archives to innovative, experimental 

        and interactive sites (Dietz, 1998).</p>

      <p class=normal>Although significant progress has been realised in the past 

        years, technical limitations still exist. In addition to the varying transmission 

        speeds and copyright issues presented as problems for museum presentations 

        on the Internet, keeping the pre-digitalized collections up to date and 

        providing access to other more dynamic museum information, such as changing 

        events and temporary exhibitions, is still quite difficult, time consuming 

        and expensive. Furthermore, the resulting museum presentation may still 

        be far from satisfying the need of the distant or remotely located visitor 

        to experience the museum "environment". By museum environment, we mean 

        not only the images and accompanying information of the digitised collections 

        but also the "aura", the living and changing space where other humans 

        are present. </p>

      <p class=normal>In knowledge of these limitations, the TOURBOT project has 

        attempted to introduce a new paradigm in providing access to cultural 

        heritage exhibits (Konstantios, 1983). Through the introduction of museum 

        visiting via a robotic avatar, it facilitates immersive tele-presence 

        with advanced visualisation capabilities. Full access to cultural exhibits 

        is granted to the user, in the sense that the latter is able to choose 

        the exhibits to visit, as well as the preferred viewing specification 

        (point of view, distance to the exhibit, resolution, etc). </p>

      <p class=normal>There is no doubt that currently access to cultural heritage 

        is limited, enjoyed mostly when physical presence in the exhibition premises 

        can be possible. At the same time, it is common understanding that alternative 

        ways should be developed in order to provide such services for remotely 

        located exhibits. In the case of professionals who need to critically 

        study realistic views of exhibits as part of their work, TOURBOT offers 

        a viable alternative to the current model that requires on-site visits. 

        Additionally, the robotic avatar operates on a twenty four-hour basis, 

        seven days a week, permitting thus more people to exploit this service 

        at their convenience.</p>

      <p class=normal>The TOURBOT approach introduces a novel model of augmented 

        environments, in that it allows human interaction with and workspace exploration 

        of a remote site. Technological advances in various fields have made it 

        possible to envision such immersive, tele-presence applications; the current 

        project exploits fully related technologies to provide an integrated solution 

        for the particular case of exhibition places.</p>

      <p class=normal>Compared to current approaches employed to provide services 

        to people with special needs, TOURBOT presents a viable alternative, since 

        it offers advanced, fully interactive access capabilities from a person's 

        residence. In the current project, access to cultural exhibits in museums' 

        premises is targeted; however, the concept introduced is quite general, 

        offering a variety of options for new services for independent living, 

        such as access to large trade fairs, technology exhibitions, etc.</p>

      <p class=normal>As a unified service to remote users, TOURBOT extends current 

        communication networks by allowing mobile robots to be part of the overall 

        structure. Such a mobile agent acts as the user's avatar, operating 

        in a physical environment that is perceived by the user through the robot's 

        sensors; interaction with the (augmented) environment is achieved by using 

        the robot's actuators. Therefore, TOURBOT results contribute towards 

        the seamless integration of networks and mobile agents for providing full 

        user access to exhibitions.</p>

      <p class=normal>The next table summarizes the features of the proposed approach 

        for cultural heritage access, contrasting them with the current possibilities 

        offered by conventional Web presentation systems.</p>

      <h1>Innovation</h1>

      <p class=normal>The very objective of the project, namely the development 

        of a robotic avatar that allows virtual user presence in an exhibition, 

        constitutes a contribution in a number of areas: interfaces for mobile 

        agent tele-control; navigation technologies; multimedia presentation systems 

        over the Web; virtual tele-presence and tele-visit. Such areas are deemed 

        essential for the evolution of a new generation of remote access technologies, 

        that built upon existing network infrastructure. </p>

      <p class=normal>The Internet is a very fast evolving technology that electronically 

        connects distant sites; however, up to now, electronic networks serve 

        mainly to exchange and acquire information. In some cases this information 

        is pictorial by means of images taken in "real time" with a stationary 

        Web-camera. To take full advantage of a network such as the Internet, 

        it would be desirable to get real physical interaction with the remote 

        site being visited. Robots, and especially mobile platforms, can extend 

        the Internet towards an interactive platform that allows actions to be 

        carried out and dynamic information to be exchanged between distant sites.</p>

      <p class=normal>The TOURBOT project implements exactly the above concept 

        for the particular case of museums as remote sites. In other words, it 

        augments current networks by substituting a terminal node with a mobile 

        platform. The latter acts as the user's avatar, by accepting commands 

        over the Internet to rove in its workspace, it therefore permits personalized 

        tele-visiting of remote exhibition sites, physical interaction and dynamic 

        selection and acquisition of the information to be retrieved.</p>

      <p class=normal>The current project capitalises on related, cutting-edge 

        technologies to accomplish its goals. According to the interdisciplinary 

        structure of the project, its major technical contributions lie in: (a) 

        advanced Web-interfaces for mobile agent tele-control and remote visualization, 

        and (b) improved navigation capabilities for complex indoor environments 

        (museum premises). The user interface will allow visitors all over the 

        world to control and interact with the robot. To safely navigate and reliably 

        operate, the robot needs advanced navigation and error recovery capabilities 

        that have not been fully demonstrated so far for autonomous robots operating 

        in populated environments.</p>

      <p class=normal>The field of mobile robotics has made serious progress in 

        the recent years. The technology has reached a state that allows the development 

        of mobile robot systems, able to operate autonomously in human environments 

        over long periods of time, without human supervision. Until today, only 

        laboratory experiments have been carried out, illustrating the capabilities 

        of the developed control systems. These systems, for example, lack mechanisms 

        for monitoring their progress and detecting execution failures. Long-term 

        reliability, however, requires that mobile robots are able to detect and 

        deal with sensor and execution failures and that they can recover from 

        such situations, either by actively choosing the optimal sensor setup 

        or by choosing necessary escape actions. Furthermore, current mobile robot 

        control systems generally consider only the robot and try to maximize 

        the robot's performance. In populated environments, however, robots must 

        adapt themselves to the behaviour of the people surrounding them.</p>

      <p class=normal>Based on the above, the scientific goals concerning the 

        navigation aspects of a robotic tour-guide include advanced techniques 

        for monitoring the execution and for detecting and escaping from execution 

        failures. Furthermore, they include sophisticated sensor interpretation 

        techniques allowing the robot to monitor its environment and to adapt 

        itself according to the abilities of the people it is guiding.</p>

      <p class=normal>The second aspect of scientific and technological objectives 

        concerns the improved interaction abilities over the Web, as well as with 

        people inside the museum. Current museum presentation systems provide 

        only information at terminals, which are close to the specific exhibits. 

        Visitors in the museum have to access these information terminals to obtain 

        detailed information about the exhibits. Portable CD or MC players provide 

        mobility, but only limited presentation and interaction capabilities. 

        Users have to follow fixed tours and obtain only audio information. These 

        presentation systems cannot in some cases flexibly react to the interests 

        of the users. The goal of this project is to develop a flexible and mobile 

        information agent, which provides individual access to the information 

        stored in a multimedia information base. This information base will include 

        graphics, images, spoken and written text as well as audio. The TOURBOT 

        system will be able to adapt the presentation to the interests of the 

        users, which will partially be derived from the interaction with them, 

        e.g. by monitoring the kind of information required by the users.</p>

      <p class=normal>A further contribution of TOURBOT lies in the aspect of 

        technology integration. The TOURBOT system will use an integrated and 

        inter-operable information base for representing all relevant aspects 

        of the environment. This information base contains all multimedia information 

        needed for the interaction with the users, as well as the layout information 

        needed for navigation tasks. The problem of an integrated model of the 

        environment serving different tasks of the robot, e.g. navigation tasks, 

        scheduling tasks and interaction with users, is still an open issue.</p>

      <p class=normal>In summary, the innovative aspects of TOURBOT include technological 

        and conceptual novelties. TOURBOT capitalizes on relevant technologies 

        to contribute to developments in remote access to cultural heritage. Moreover, 

        it introduces a new model of remote information browsing over the Web. 

        A few years ago, Web browsers were quite primitive; now they are becoming 

        increasingly sophisticated and there are already versions of browsers 

        that allow manipulation of three-dimensional worlds. The next step in 

        this evolution chain seems to be the provision of facilities for active 

        physical exploration of distant sites. TOURBOT presents a real innovation 

        in this aspect, by introducing this concept in museums and exhibition 

        centers.</p>

      <h1>Community Added Value</h1>

      <p class=normal>Information society, in the dawn of the 3<sup>rd</sup> millennium, 

        advances far beyond the mere use of technology in well-established application 

        areas (i.e. banking, booking, office automation, etc), by incorporating 

        novel models of information access and management. With a clear focus 

        on user-friendliness, accessibility of technologies to the broader public, 

        and integration and convergence across information processing, communication 

        and media, research and development efforts are addressing conventional 

        applications under a new perspective. Globalization and the ever-increasing 

        demand for transparent and personalized access to various kinds of information 

        are the driving forces for research in this area, paving the way towards 

        services that are universally and seamlessly accessible to all. </p>

      <h1>Access to cultural heritage</h1>

      <p class=normal>Cultural heritage is currently being under-exploited, accessed 

        mostly through conventional channels. In a few cases, attempts are developing 

        towards Web-based systems, to provide access to specific views of related 

        objects. Still, such systems support limited access, by either presenting 

        static images or low resolution virtual reality representations of sub-sets 

        of cultural exhibits. However, advanced and immersive access to such expositions 

        is a prerequisite for a content-rich information society. TOURBOT assists 

        the globalization of the access to cultural exhibits, by capitalizing 

        on established technologies, to provide tele-presence in a distant museum's 

        premises and personalized visit of the exhibits.</p>

      <h1>Tele-presence services</h1>

      <p class=normal>The mobility of the robot allows Web visitors to choose 

        a wide variety of view-points and enjoy tele-presence in the museum. Therefore, 

        it provides the means to overcome the barriers of distance, limited time 

        and restricted mobility of potential users, offering them the possibility 

        to visit the museum through a robotic avatar. Citizens and professionals 

        can thus benefit from the increased services offered; moreover, this can 

        be particularly advantageous for people with restricted mobility, since 

        it provides customized, user-friendly and full access to cultural exhibits. 

        Besides, increased interaction capabilities with the exhibits themselves 

        are offered to the user, which may be useful when visiting a science or 

        technology museum. In addition to this increased interactivity, the robotic 

        avatar can deliver high-resolution images over the Web, being thus extremely 

        beneficial to professionals and specialists.</p>

      <p class=normal>There is no doubt that, currently, access to cultural heritage 

        is limited, enjoyed mostly as a by-product of holidays or other recreational 

        activities. At the same time, it is common understanding that alternative 

        ways should be developed in order to provide such services for remotely 

        located exhibits. In the case of professionals that need to critically 

        study realistic views of exhibits as part of their work, TOURBOT offers 

        a viable alternative to the current model that requires site-by-site visits. 

        Additionally, the robotic avatar could operate on a twenty four-hour basis, 

        seven days a week, permitting thus more people to exploit this service 

        at their convenience. Since TOURBOT also operates as a tour guide in a 

        museum's premises, certain advantages are offered to museum visitors. 

        They have the ability to individually exploit the expertise stored in 

        the tour-guide robot, which can react flexibly to their requirements. 

        It can, for example, offer dedicated tours on temporary focuses of the 

        exhibition or alternatively give overview tours. As a side effect of this 

        concept, museum visitors get acquainted with new, cutting-edge technology 

        by easily interacting with a complex robotic system. Therefore, technological 

        advances are seamlessly assimilated in everyday activities. </p>

      <p class=normal>Successful completion of TOURBOT will trigger new vistas 

        in other, related application areas, such as large trade fairs that need 

        to be visited by remotely located persons. Besides the cultural aspects, 

        TOURBOT has also a clear direction in education and entertainment. Imagine, 

        for example, exploring the exhibits of a museum, all from the comfort 

        of your home as a diversion on a cold winter evening. You are provided 

        with your own, personalized telescope that aims at revealing the wonders 

        of culture; certainly an entertainment and educational possibility.</p>

      <p class=normal>Moreover, TOURBOT addresses the cultural industries' 

        practices and strategies that, in the cases of museums and other cultural 

        exhibitions, have remained practically static for the last decades. Such 

        environments are usually organised in a way that a visitor will benefit 

        from her physical presence to get an appreciation and other information 

        regarding the exhibits. The recent introduction of fixed terminals and 

        other audio-visual aids in museums (Roussou and Efraimoglou, 1999) has 

        contributed towards providing better services to visitors, and thus helped 

        increase their market penetration. </p>

      <p class=normal>Museum Web-visitors are recently also experiencing Internet 

        access to images of exhibits as well as virtual reality representations 

        of a museum's environment. However, with current technology such 

        access is limited due to the non-interactive nature of pre-recorded images 

        or videos, or the inherent low resolution capabilities of virtual reality 

        worlds. The TOURBOT concept facilitates active navigation in the real 

        museum's workspace and observation of objects of interest through 

        the robotic avatar. At the same time, the robotic platform serves as an 

        on-site tour guide, providing advanced services to visitors. The above-described 

        expansions to museums' practices and procedures are expected to contribute 

        towards a corresponding increase in the market potential of such organisations 

        and will constitute an asset for museums and other sites for cultural 

        heritage promotion.</p>

      <h1>Economic Development and Prospects</h1>

      <p class=normal>The possibilities of new paradigms in providing access to 

        cultural exhibits offered by the information society are developing fast. 

        In recent years we are witnessing a gradual adoption of media-technologies 

        in various aspects of the sector, such as digital document preservation, 

        media- and Web-presentation, graphical animations, etc. The advent of 

        such technologies contributes towards providing media-rich presentations 

        of cultural exhibits and consequently offering better services to museum 

        visitors. Lately, Internet and Web-based technologies are also employed, 

        for providing access mostly to images of exhibited objects.</p>

      <p class=normal>Worldwide, many museums and exhibition halls are currently 

        exploiting such technologies, aiming at increasing their market shares. 

        The potential offered by the introduction of media technologies is immense, 

        provided that novel and attracting services will be offered as a result 

        of such developments.</p>

      <p class=normal>The TOURBOT concept is in-line with the above issues, facilitating 

        tele-presence and effective access to cultural exhibits through robotic 

        avatars. TOURBOT capitalizes on cutting-edge technologies providing increased 

        interaction with the site being visited. Effectively, it augments existing 

        communication networks that are nowadays used to transmit information 

        that is viewed via a browser, with mobile platforms at particular nodes 

        that allow for dynamic selection and acquisition of the information to 

        be retrieved. An extrapolation of current trends reveals that its employment 

        in the cultural industries' practices will have a positive impact.</p>

      <p class=normal>Furthermore, new vistas open for TOURBOT results in other 

        exhibition sectors, such as large trade fairs. In such exhibitions, and 

        generally in exhibitions where the items presented (content being displayed) 

        change often in short periods of time, TOURBOT technology may be extremely 

        valuable for providing access to distant users. In such cases it is not 

        realistic to provide even simple, static images of the exhibits on the 

        Web, since the dynamic nature of the exhibition's content would turn 

        the Web pages obsolete very fast. The situation is even worse with richer 

        representations of the exhibits (videos, virtual reality representations), 

        since the effort needed for their development may not pay off. Alternatively, 

        robotic avatars can be introduced in these cases to seamlessly provide 

        access to Web-visitors to the contemporary content of the exhibition.

      <h1>Concluding Remarks</h1>

      <p class=normal>The TOURBOT project addresses the development of a robotic 

        avatar, able to provide individual access to museums' exhibits over 

        the Internet. Such mobile agents allow virtual tele-presence in physical 

        environments, effectively supplementing existent network infrastructure 

        by allowing mobile avatars to replace network terminal nodes. The project 

        goals are pursued by a consortium comprised by technology providers, brokers 

        of technology to museums and end-users (museums). Early experiments prior 

        to TOURBOT have been conducted at the Deutsches Museum Bonn with RHINO 

        (Burgard et al., 2000).</p>

      <p class=normal>TOURBOT, as currently being pursued, aims at the development 

        of interactive tour-guide robots able to provide access to museums' 

        exhibits over the internet. The proposed approach introduces a novel model 

        of augmented environments, in that it allows human interaction with and 

        workspace exploration of a remote site by means of a robotic avatar. Therefore, 

        it extends current communication networks by allowing mobile robots to 

        be part of the overall structure and it contributes towards the seamless 

        integration of networks and mobile agents, an application that will soon 

        become an integral part of our everyday lives.</p>
