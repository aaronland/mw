      <h1 class="PaperTitle">Creating Online Galleries of Information for K-12 

        Audiences</h1>

      <h2 class="Author">Ranya Sihweil, The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing 

        Arts, USA</h2>

      <h1 class="abstractTitle">Abstract</h1>

      <p class=AbstractText>This paper will examine recent initiatives to create 

        original &quot;mini-sites&quot; of information and resources for use in 

        K-12 classrooms. These &quot;galleries of information&quot; include cross-institutional 

        collaborations with various arts and humanities organizations across the 

        world. In particular, the paper will focus on an interactive site based 

        on the life and music of Duke Ellington as well as on a mini-site celebrating 

        the arts of Ireland through a &quot;virtual museum&quot; based on art 

        works from private and public collections in the United States and Ireland. 

        These online exhibits and sites were created specifically for educational 

        use and embody certain aspects and attributes worth sharing with the broader 

        arts community. Highlights will include: designing for a diverse audience 

        with various technological capabilities; gathering and re-presenting original 

        materials; and creating arts-integrated lesson plans and activities for 

        young online audiences.</p>

      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

      <p class=normal>On the cusp of marking and celebrating ten years of life 

        on the Internet, ARTSEDGE has evolved from being a repository of information 

        to being a creator of arts and education materials. As technology and 

        access to technology continues to grow at a faster rate than our Web site, 

        our original mission needed to be revisited and ultimately be revised 

        in order to accommodate and incorporate the growing trends of education 

        online. Maintaining our position as pioneers in online education was being 

        threatened by the incessant influx of new search engines and professional 

        cataloguers of information. This shifting environment led us to the creation 

        of mini-sites that would allow us to continue to create and disseminate 

        high-quality materials to our users without alienating them by using cutting-edge 

        technology.</p>

      <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>

      <p class=normal>As the nation's center for the performing arts, The 

        John F. Kennedy Center has come to symbolize America's regard for 

        the arts. It serves as a dynamic resource that contributes to the cultural 

        enrichment of audiences from around the world. Recognizing that the arts 

        can provide multiple learning modalities, challenge students to think 

        in new ways, and foster creativity, the Center is also a national leader 

        in the development of arts education policy and programs. The Center's 

        programs are designed specifically to foster an appreciation and understanding 

        of <i>all</i> the arts.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Center has a unique Congressional mandate to increase 

        opportunities for all people to participate in and understand the arts. 

        Arts education is the key to realizing this mandate. The Center's 

        involvement in providing Internet content for educators began ten years 

        ago, when the National Endowment for the Arts asked the Center to review 

        existing arts education mechanisms and to propose strategies for disseminating 

        new and exemplary programs nationwide. The result was a proposal for a 

        project, initially known as the Arts Education Dissemination Network, 

        that would serve as a clearinghouse and communications tool for<span class="Normal"> 

        arts education specialists. After extensive pilot testing, a brief stint 

        as a Gopher site, the site became known as ARTSEDGE: The National Arts 

        and Education Information Network. The <b>goals</b> were, and remain, 

        simple:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> CONNECT PEOPLE TO PEOPLE -- resulting in a stronger 

          and more cohesive arts community nationwide by helping people communicate 

          and share information and ideas 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> CONNECT PEOPLE TO INFORMATION AND RESOURCES -- 

          helping the arts community to learn from itself as well as from the 

          broader education community, and to participate fully in the ever-expanding 

          worldwide knowledge base 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> BUILD A NEW BASE OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE ARTS AND EDUCATION 

          -- showcasing contributions of teachers and artist-educators who 

          have developed and successfully implemented arts-based, interdisciplinary 

          programs and practices that are linked with new standards for excellence 

          in education 

      </ul>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">The main <b>purpose</b> of ARTSEDGE 

        is to support the place of arts education at the center of the curriculum 

        through creative and appropriate uses of technology. The mission of ARTSEDGE 

        through the millennium has grown out of the aforementioned goals: connecting 

        people to people, connecting people to information and resources, and 

        building a new base of knowledge in the arts and education. These vital 

        goals continue to be expanded to reflect the influences of both recent 

        education reform and technological innovation, enabling a stronger emphasis 

        on interaction.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">The<b> mission</b> of ARTSEDGE continues 

        to center around using technology to contri</span>bute to the field of 

        arts education, rather than around technology itself. ARTSEDGE is about 

        content, not merely technology. It will generate and share original and 

        updated material about arts education. This material is part of the easily 

        accessible, flexible information contained in the ARTSEDGE network databases.</p>

      <p class=normal>The<b> vision</b> for ARTSEDGE includes expanded attention 

        to initiatives that include collaboration, research, and the documentation 

        and publication of our process. These initiatives encourage participant 

        interactivity and create a group of contributing stakeholders. ARTSEDGE 

        is at the hub of a community whose members actively participate in the 

        construction of the Web site by contributing both product and process 

        information. For example, teachers across the globe can contribute original 

        lesson plans and share valuable resources on the site. Working with recent 

        developments in knowledge representation and instructional strategy moves 

        arts education toward the center of the curriculum. ARTSEDGE showcases 

        interdisciplinary initiatives and projects that integrate the arts across 

        the curriculum.</p>

      <h1>THE BIRTH OF THE MINI-SITE</h1>

      <p class=normal>By implied definition, a mini-site is a little site. By 

        ARTSEDGE's criteria, our mini-sites are resource-rich, self-contained 

        explorations of a particular theme or subject. These sites contain activities 

        and resources for both classroom and at-home use that will facilitate 

        project-based learning.</p>

      <p class=normal>As dead dot coms litter the information highway, the staff 

        of ARTSEDGE have continued to struggle with ways of maintaining a site 

        that strives to be cutting-edge without alienating our main demographic: 

        teachers who more often than not have to endure slow connections on old 

        computers with an over-taxed, understaffed tech support system. We concluded 

        that in order to maximize our contribution to arts education, we have 

        to provide cutting-edge <i>content</i> through cutting-edge <i>design</i> 

        rather than through the advanced, yet unattainable technology that continually 

        seduces anyone who works on a Web site. So this became our maxim for the 

        site -- that access for all would take precedent over flashy technological 

        features.</p>

      <p class=normal>The main idea behind creating mini-sites was so that we 

        could offer teachers thematic-based "units" that would combine the best 

        of technology with the best of content. Yet, despite having made this 

        decision, we continued to remain torn: other sites were more dynamic; 

        they had clever interactive features and a snazzier presentation. This 

        growing online "competition" led us to the exploration of creating mini-sites. 

        We would maintain our "design for all" perspective for the main ARTSEDGE 

        site, especially for the areas that teachers visited most often -- 

        such as lesson plans -- and create a series of offspring: sites that 

        would bring the content to the classroom using creative and advanced technology. 

        This satisfied our desire to explore the various aspects of technology 

        that enticed us as users. The use of mini-sites proved to be a successful 

        solution that suited everyone involved. The teachers could continue to 

        retrieve "print and teach" lessons, and the wired classrooms could access 

        the quality content they are used to with new and innovative technological 

        features. Finally, ARTSEDGE could deliver content to everyone and not 

        compromise our status as pioneers in the field of educational online technology.</p>

      <h2>Criteria for Creating Mini-Sites</h2>

      <p class=normal>The current vision for ARTSEDGE includes expanded attention 

        to initiatives that include collaboration, research, and process documentation 

        and publication. These initiatives encourage participant interactivity 

        and create a group of contributing stakeholders. ARTSEDGE is at the hub 

        of a community whose members actively participate in the construction 

        of the Web site, by contributing both product and process information. 

        Working with recent developments in knowledge representation and instructional 

        strategy moves arts education toward the center of the curriculum. ARTSEDGE 

        represents interdisciplinary initiatives and projects that integrate the 

        arts across the curriculum.</p>

      <p class=normal>ARTSEDGE has continued to develop and expand rapidly. Now 

        both individuals and organizations can bring forth resources, links, or 

        proposals and attempt to gain support from or collaborate with us on a 

        more regular basis. The development of some criteria to judge these offerings, 

        as well as material developed especially for publication on the site, 

        has become necessary. ARTSEDGE has generated guiding principles for internal 

        purposes. Every project, activity, resource or event that ARTSEDGE develops 

        alone or in collaboration with others should adhere to one or more of 

        the following overarching principles.</p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">The following represent only a small 

        sampling of some of the principals we follow when developing new collaborative 

        projects such as mini-sites:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Interactivity is an essential part of an ARTSEDGE 

          project. It will be included in as many projects and aspects of them 

          as possible. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> ARTSEDGE seeks to support accessibility to electronic 

          educational resources for all people. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> ARTSEDGE will continue to maintain a high level of 

          accessibility for individuals with disabilities. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> ARTSEDGE will assist in closing the gender gap in 

          the field of information technology by providing quality, high-interest 

          materials that will be of interest to <i>all </i>students. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> ARTSEDGE will provide multicultural resources that 

          address the varied cultural base of the American people. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> ARTSEDGE seeks to support educators in conceptualizing 

          through standards when preparing instruction, rather than matching standards 

          to instructional materials after they are delivered. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> ARTSEDGE resources will be aligned with the national 

          and state art standards, as applicable. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> All ARTSEDGE resources will be passed through a vetting 

          system described below. The purpose of this activity is to certify the 

          accuracy and validity of all information published on the site from 

          representatives of the covered disciplines, as well as to review and 

          obtain recommendations regarding the level of content matter and its 

          appropriateness. This panel has a tactical mission in ensuring the truth 

          and validity of all materials published on the site. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> All materials on the site will be reviewed by our 

          Teachers' Advisory Council (TAC), which is made up of 30 teachers from 

          a variety of grade levels and subject areas. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> All materials will be vetted for practical application 

          in the field, for correlation with the National Standards, and for correctness 

          and quality of content. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> The TAC reviews material regarding its practicality, 

          pedagogy, and classroom usability. It also acts as a content review 

          panel consisting of discipline-specific experts in each discipline in 

          which ARTSEDGE publishes units, lessons, or activities.

      <h2>Choosing a Theme</h2>

      <p class=normal>Teachers have been creating thematic units in their classrooms 

        for decades. In other words, the concept is not a new one. For ARTSEDGE, 

        the most difficult aspect of developing a mini-site is choosing a theme/subject. 

        Being aware of the pitfalls of creating content that reflects the personal 

        interests of staff members (often times the authors of content on the 

        site) is always difficult. How we chose a theme may sometimes be random 

        and may end up being based on an individual staff member's interest, but 

        in the end, we always seek to answer the same question: will it be used 

        in classrooms nationwide? As the popularity for our initial ventures into 

        this arena grows, so has our method.</p>

      <p class=normal>We have begun to develop a matrix that collects surveys 

        from teachers we meet in workshops or those who are active on our ListServs. 

        We now look for voids in content online and if a need for certain types 

        of information and resources exist, we try to address it. Conversely, 

        if we get excited about creating a site on a particular subject and our 

        Internet resources show that another education site has comparable resources, 

        we abandon that idea. Re-creating the wheel is unfortunately the easiest 

        trap to fall into when creating materials online -- it sometimes does 

        not seem feasible to generate a completely original idea. In addition, 

        it is impossible for a small staff to become experts on a theme, and with 

        limited budget resources, hiring experts is often not an option. So we 

        collaborate and locate an "expert organization" that is willing to work 

        with us to find a way that their resources can be easily accessible by 

        teachers from around the country. Potential partners have included schools, 

        universities, museums, performing arts organizations, and non-profit education 

        organizations.</p>

      <h1>A FEW OF THE ARTSEDGE MINI-SITES</h1>

      <h2>African Odyssey Interactive (<a href="http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/aoi">http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/aoi</a>)</h2>

      <p class=normal>African Odyssey Interactive (AOI) was our first mini-site 

        created around five years ago as part of the Kennedy Center's African 

        Odyssey Festival. The purpose of AOI is to promote an ongoing exchange 

        of ideas, information, and resources between artists, teachers, and students 

        on African arts and culture.</p>

      <p class=normal>ARTSEDGE has a special relationship with AOI, a long-term 

        Kennedy Center initiative: we collaborate to produce teaching resources 

        and new content regarding African culture and the African Diaspora. We 

        do this by capitalizing on our position within the Kennedy Center to make 

        their African Odyssey performing arts resources available to educators 

        across the country. ARTSEDGE earnestly attempts to achieve its goal of 

        creating a new base of knowledge, and the AOI site is a particularly successful 

        example. ARTSEDGE has not only gathered African arts and cultural resources 

        for teachers, but has consistently generated new information by providing 

        interactive opportunities for them. During each season of the annual Kennedy 

        Center's African Odyssey Festival, ARTSEDGE hosts a weekly online 

        chat with an African performer or diplomat. Frequently, the performers 

        are brought to the studios of another collaborator, the Prince William 

        School TV Network, where they give televised workshops on their art form. 

        The workshops are followed by interactive teleconferences so that students 

        anywhere can see the performance, participate in the workshop, and then 

        interact with the performer. Archives of all of our interactive events 

        are available online as new warehouses of information about African culture 

        and student learning.</p>

      <p class=normal>Partly because the site has continued over the past five 

        years to be an initiative of the Kennedy Center's African Odyssey 

        Festival program, it has taken an independent stance online. It is one 

        of the ten most accessed features of the ARTSEDGE site and continues to 

        provide information to teachers on a regular basis.</p>

      <h2>The Duke Ellington Centennial Site (<a href="http://dellington.org/">http://dellington.org</a>)</h2>

      <p class=normal>This site was created to celebrate the centennial of Duke 

        Ellington's birth. A collaboration between ARTSEDGE, MENC: The National 

        Association for Music Education, and the Smithsonian Institution's National 

        Museum of American History, the Duke Ellington Centennial Site was designed 

        to bring the world of Duke Ellington alive for students and others interested 

        in his life and music.</p>

      <p class=normal>MENC, the world's largest arts education organization, is 

        the only association that addresses all aspects of music education. More 

        than 80,000 members represent all levels of teaching from pre-school to 

        graduate school. Since 1907, MENC has worked to ensure that every student 

        has access to a well-balanced, comprehensive, and high-quality program 

        of music instruction that is taught by qualified teachers. MENC's activities 

        and resources have been largely responsible for the establishment of music 

        education as a profession, for the promotion and guidance of music study 

        as an integral part of the school curriculum, and for the development 

        of the National Standards for Arts Education.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American 

        History (NMAH) is home to many of our nation's treasures, including the 

        Duke Ellington Collection. As part of its commitment to preserving America's 

        jazz heritage, NMAH supports the Duke Ellington Youth Project, the Jazz 

        Masterworks Orchestra and other projects devoted to encouraging creativity 

        and exploration in this uniquely American form of music.</p>

      <p class=normal>This unique partnership proved to be successful in identifying 

        and disseminating new and original content. As access to resources on 

        the Internet became vastly available (and abundant) it was obvious that 

        unless we came up with a fruitful partnership, we would end up repackaging 

        the same material that already existed online. At the time, many renowned 

        organizations were building sites about Ellington, so "competing" with 

        experts from the perspective of content development would have been an 

        exercise in futility. Both MENC and the NMAH were also interested in creating 

        educational materials, but no one organization could do it on such a broad 

        level alone. This trio made perfect sense: the music educators would provide 

        the lesson plans, the museum would provide the visual and biographical 

        documentation, and ARTSEDGE would be the vehicle for the dissemination 

        of this information--a medium teachers are already accustomed to using.</p>

      <p class=normal>Although the site resides on the ARTSEDGE ser<span class="Normal">ver, 

        in the spirit of collaboration it was decided that the URL would serve 

        two purposes: be both a direct reflection of Ellington while showing no 

        bias towards a single partner.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">The site features:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <p class=normal> 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Standards-based lessons and activities developed by 

          MENC that includes interactive listening lessons that to date (two years 

          after launching) have been used by approximately 5,000 students! 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> A virtual Student Gallery, featuring artwork and original 

          poetry (part of the DC Duke Ellington Youth Festival) by students at 

          the Duke Ellington School for the Arts in Washington, DC. ARTSEDGE staff 

          members visited the school to hear the students recite their poetry 

          and found that the emotion could not be replicated in a text description 

          so went back and recorded them. Every poem featured on the site has 

          an audio clip of the author's entire reading. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Over 100 photos from the Duke Ellington collection 

          at the Smithsonian, in the form of an annotated scrapbook. Many of these 

          images had never been published online or in print, and the opportunity 

          to feature such special and rare documents was a very exciting part 

          of this partnership. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> A threaded discussion area for conversing with others 

          interested in Ellington. In May 1999, this featured a month-long interactive 

          discussion with Ellington experts. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> A listing of Ellington-related Web links and online 

          resources that includes selected bibliographies, discographies, and 

          curriculum sources. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> A calendar of celebrations that took place on and 

          around the Centennial of Ellington's birth on April 29th and throughout 

          the year. 

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> A special timeline that contextually places Ellington 

          in world history. 

      </ul>

      <p class=normal>This site has become one of the most visited parts of ARTSEDGE 

        and is one of the greatest examples of what can happen online between 

        different organizations. Teachers across the county have expressed both 

        their fascination and delight with the many original and user-friendly 

        features.</p>

      <h2>Island Online: A Celebration of Irish Arts (<a href="http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/irish">http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/irish</a>)</h2>

      <p class=normal>In May 2000, the Kennedy Center launched a two-week festival 

        celebrating the Irish Arts. The Center showcased music, dance, theater, 

        film, literature and visual arts from Ireland and Northern Ireland. Recognizing 

        the educational component of many of these events, ARTSEDGE created Island 

        Online, a virtual celebration of the Irish arts. The site provides opportunities 

        for teachers and students to discover a wealth of Irish resources for 

        use in the K-12 classroom.</p>

      <p class=normal>While the partnerships created for the Ellington site were 

        fostered for the development of online resources, numerous organizations 

        with which we partnered for Island Online were already in place by Kennedy 

        Center programming and other programs in the Education Department. Finding 

        the "expert" was a little easier this time around because our colleagues 

        had already developed much of the work. The Kennedy Center created a major 

        educational initiative with the US Department of Education and the Departments 

        of Education in Ireland and Northern Ireland. The goal was to link Irish 

        and American schools through the study of each other's art and culture. 

        ARTSEDGE divided the many aspects of the festival into four major categories: 

        look, listen, learn and share.</p>

      <h2>Look: Virtual Exhibits from International Collections of Irish Art</h2>

      <p class=normal>The Kennedy Center exhibited the private collection of Brian 

        P. Burns during the Festival. The Burns Collection includes paintings 

        and sculptures by Jack B. Yeats, Roderic O'Conor, Paul Henry, Walter Osborne, 

        Sir William Orpen and others that span from the mid-19th to the mid-20th 

        century. Brian Burns generously allowed ARTSEDGE to videotape and photograph 

        his collection for online dissemination. The virtual exhibit takes the 

        viewer on a "walk" through the collection. In addition to the text that 

        was provided to ARTSEDGE by the Burns Foundation on each piece, Mr. Burns 

        walked with us through the gallery and provided anecdotes about these 

        paintings. Video and sound clips from this extraordinary event are interwoven 

        throughout the site.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Ulster Museum in Belfast also partnered with ARTSEDGE 

        and sent us digital images of highlights from their collection. Their 

        own Web site has not yet published these images on it, so this opportunity 

        was unique for both organizations. The exhibit &quot;A Land of Heart's 

        Desire: 300 Years of Irish Art&quot; from the museum<b> </b>is a stunning 

        collection of 18th, 19th and 20th century Irish paintings including works 

        by John Lavery, William Orpen, Roderic O'Conor and many more.</p>

      <h2>Listen: An Online Student Music Exchange</h2>

      <p class=normal>In partnership with the Departments of Education in Ireland, 

        Northern Ireland and the United States, the Kennedy Center coordinated 

        a music exchange between schools in these countries. Through the Center's 

        Artists in Residency program, five musicians from around Ireland visited 

        schools in the Washington, DC Metro area. The site includes photographs 

        of their interactions with the students and video clips of the music they 

        made together. Additionally, four members of ARTSEDGE's Teachers 

        Advisory Council visited schools in Ireland to meet the teachers and coordinate 

        the online music project. This project is still in process and has not 

        yet been debuted online! Students from schools in Ireland created music 

        that was digitized and sent to schools in the United States. The participating 

        US schools are currently expanding this piece, and the final result of 

        this collaboration and the lesson plans used to create it will soon be 

        published on the site.</p>

      <h2>Learn: Lesson Plans and Resources About the Irish Arts</h2>

      <p class=normal>This part of the Irish site includes lessons and resources 

        on Irish arts and culture and includes a comprehensive unit on the paintings 

        of Jack B. Yeats, the poetry of his brother William, and the artistic 

        contributions of the rest of his dynamic family.</p>

      <h2>Share: An Online Interactive Space for Storytellers and Artists</h2>

      <p class=normal>ARTSEDGE created a virtual environment for storytellers, 

        artists, students and teachers to share their experiences online with 

        people around the world. The section "Storytelling Online: Mythology Across 

        Time and Borders" is a collaborative program created by ARTSEDGE with 

        some of the world's most beloved storytellers, for students and teachers 

        to enjoy the art of storytelling. The theme for the storytelling project 

        is mythology and the participating authors are mythmakers in their own 

        right--they will share their stories and thoughts on the process of 

        myth making on the site.</p>

      <p class=normal>Renowned authors Nick Bantock and Katherine Neville graciously 

        offered to lend their time and expertise to teachers and students in writing 

        workshops, teacher training and online discussions. Similarities and differences 

        among cultures will be uncovered, mythical archetypes discovered, and 

        exploratory/migratory patterns examined during this exchange. Katherine 

        Neville also worked with us to videotape a discussion of her writing experiences.</p>

      <p class=normal>The online workshop includes lesson plans and process-based 

        instructional activities for teachers to implement in their classrooms, 

        and the students will post their stories online for commentary by their 

        peers in the partner schools and by the professional writers participating. 

        Discussion boards and chat room facilities will be made available for 

        both real-time and e-mail based collaborative exchanges between both the 

        students and the teachers.</p>

      <p class=normal>Although the festival is long over, this project has not 

        yet been completed. Unfortunately, the festival took place towards the 

        end of the school year and coordinating with schools at this time became 

        very difficult. The project is still in progress and will reach completion 

        and publication online this Spring.</p>

      <p class=normal>Connections will also be made to existing ARTSEDGE Storytelling 

        resources, including African Odyssey Interactive's "Story Spinning" 

        site.</p>

      <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

      <p class=normal>The founding director of ARTSEDGE stated our vision clearly: 

        &quot;Most importantly, this initiative is about content and the efficient 

        exchange of information and ideas. Our vision represents the significant 

        opportunity we have in this time of education reform to bring together 

        and organize the best of idea, information, and resources from the arts 

        and from education-- to create one knowledge base for the education 

        and enjoyment of future generations.&quot; Ten years later, after passing 

        through the various stages of cyber-infancy, ARTSEDGE has reached its 

        current adolescent state, providing the best possible educational resources 

        to a cherished user base of over a quarter million teachers per month. 

        Of these quarter million, an estimated 40% are recurring visitors. Maintaining 

        our position as pioneers in online education and consistently developing 

        new materials that utilize the wealth of resources that are available 

        on the Internet is vital.</p>

      <p class=normal>&quot;Arts learning, involving as its does the construction, 

        interweaving, and interpretation of personal socio-cultural meaning, calls 

        upon a constellation of capacities and dispositions which are layers and 

        unified in the construction of forms we call paintings, poems, musical 

        compositions, and dances. Many of these same competencies and dispositions 

        extend to other subject domains where they coalesce in equally distinctive 

        forms -- mathematical, scientific, linguistic -- as pupils organize different 

        kinds of meaning, insight, and understanding.&quot; (Champions of Change, 

        page 45)</p>

      <p class=normal>Collaborating with other educational and arts organizations 

        to create mini-sites to successfully integrate the arts throughout the 

        curriculum will continue to be at the top of our agenda. Creating these 

        sites involves "construction, interweaving, and interpretation of personal 

        socio-cultural meaning, [and] calls upon a constellation of capacities 

        and dispositions which are layers and unified in the construction of..."
