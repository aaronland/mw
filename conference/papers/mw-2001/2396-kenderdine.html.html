      <p class=PaperTitle>1000 years of the Olympic Games: Treasures of Ancient 

        Greece: Digital Reconstruction at the Home of the Gods. </p>

      <p class=Author>Sarah Kenderdine, Powerhouse Museum, Australia </p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>This paper results from a recently completed project 

        that augmented an exhibition at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, entitled 

        <i>1000 Years of the Olympic Games: treasures of ancient Greece </i>(July 

        18 -- November 18, 2000)<i>. </i>This Exhibition<i> </i>offered an 

        opportunity to supplement the traditional visitor experience with the 

        introduction of 'virtual reality' components. These include 

        a 3D digital reconstruction of the archaeological site of Olympia in 200 

        BC; the laser scan of the famous statue of Zeus from the archaeological 

        museum in Athens; and the construction of a large-scale Web (<a

href="http://www.phm.gov.au/ancient_greek_olympics" target="new">http://www.phm.gov.au/ancient_greek_olympics</a>) 

        that combines the Exhibition components with a host of other information 

        sources. </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The paper reflects on the theoretical concerns companion 

        to the processes of digital reconstructions using historical and archaeological 

        data sets. From this position it is possible to examine the curatorial 

        and technical decisions made in creating the works. An outline of the 

        web architecture and design is presented. A statistical analysis of the 

        web since its launch is also examined. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class=normal>Here we enter the ancient sanctuary of the gods of Olympia, 

        witness Zeus the wielder of the thunderbolts, and walk the archaeological 

        site of Olympia as it appears today. The works under discussion result 

        from a recently completed project that augmented an exhibition at the 

        Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, entitled <i>1000 Years of the Olympic Games: 

        treasures of ancient Greece </i>(July 18 -- November 18, 2000)<i>. 

        </i>This Exhibition<i> </i>offered an opportunity to supplement the traditional 

        visitor experience with the introduction of virtual reality components. 

        These were a 3D digital reconstruction of the archaeological site of Olympia, 

        in 200 BC, the laser scan of the famous statue of Zeus from the archaeological 

        museum in Athens, and the construction of a large scale Web which delivered 

        the Exhibition components together with a host of other information sources 

        and interpretive information. </p>

      <p class=normal>This paper begins by introducing some of the visions, opportunities 

        and cautionary perspectives that are companion to the processes of archaeological 

        reconstruction using digital tools. Observant to the potential and difficulties 

        inherent in digital reconstruction, the paper will then discuss some the 

        curatorial and technical aspects of creating the information complex: 

        the reconstruction of Olympia; the laser scan of Zeus; and the presentation 

        of materials on the Web. </p>

      <p class=normal>The paper examines the data acquisition process at the site 

        of Olympia, and the archaeological and historical data considerations 

        that were the basis for creating the 3D visualisation of the site in 200 

        BC. The scan and display of the statue of Zeus is also outlined. A brief 

        description of the web contents introduces the technical, architectural 

        and curatorial decisions that were used to define the design. This section 

        concludes with a statistical analysis of the Web usage since its launch. 

        Reviews of the Web by industry, and education and research awards that 

        the works have attracted to date, conclude the discussions. </p>

      <h1>Theory in Digital Archaeological Visualisations</h1>

      <h2>Opportunities</h2>

      <p class=normal>In theory, digital reconstructions represent a paramount 

        tool of enquiry for archaeologists. As Forte (2000) notes, this can occur 

        when:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>..."interactive-computational simulation" 

        becomes the methodical ideal of the scientist: reason and observation 

        permit the break down of an event into its primary elements and from these 

        it is reconstructed. A tight link is established between computational 

        information and the "architecture of thought", because both embody man's 

        desire to be the "architect" of the "world". A portion of the real is 

        no longer represented by a chain of ideas in which all pertinent information 

        is housed; instead it is reconstructed in a way that the observer can 

        immerse himself, react to it and be reacted to... </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span lang=EN-AU>...Through the collection of multiple 

        forms of data otherwise lost, that become homogeneous after calculation, 

        a model of the event can be constructed. This allows for the step-by-step 

        visualisation of all phases, providing humanity with extraordinary predictive 

        power, since each level is the necessary condition for the next one. </span></p>

      <p class=normal>The techniques of immersion, interaction, and sensorial 

        interaction are all based on perceptive mechanisms (Gregory, 1998 in Forte, 

        2000). They represent instruments that permit the user to operate in synthetic 

        space; that is, to be able to understand synthetic space in all of its 

        richness through the shifting of points of view (Forte, 2000). In archaeological 

        enquiries, the richness of the medium for teaching and theory testing 

        in the form of alternate visualisations is potentially unlimited. </p>

      <p class=normal>To situate digital visualisations of archaeological and 

        historical sites into museums and to translate them for the Internet represents a powerful form of interpretation. It allows for complex datasets 

        to be drawn together forming products that are multi-sensory and easily 

        accessible. </p>

      <p class=normal>Colonna (1994) presents his view of the flexible nature 

        of digitally reconstructed environments (as discussed by Barceló).</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span lang=EN-GB>A virtual world should be, then a <i>model</i>, 

        a set of concepts, laws, tested hypotheses and hypotheses waiting for 

        testing. If in standard theories, concepts are expressed linguistically 

        or mathematically, in virtual environments, theories are expressed computationally, 

        by using images and rendering effects. Nothing should be wrong or "imaginary" 

        in a virtual reconstruction, but should follow what we know, be dynamical, 

        and be interactively modifiable. A virtual experience is then a way of 

        studying a geometrical model--a scientific theory expressed with a 

        geometric language--instead of studying empirical reality. As such 

        it should be related with work on the empirical reality (excavation, laboratory 

        analysis). As a result we can act virtually with inaccessible artefacts, 

        buildings and landscapes through their models (Barcel</span>ó<span lang=EN-GB>, 

        2000). </span></p>

      <p class=normal>For the Olympia project, the empirical reality was based 

        on numerous excavation reports and historical and scholastic sources discussed 

        below, and in aerial and geological ground survey data. A considerable 

        component of the project was the acquisition and analysis of source information, 

        especially as a high degree of veracity and verisimilitude was required. 

        The digital reconstruction process attempted at all times to create an 

        archaeologically correct interpretation of the research materials available.<span

lang=EN-GB> </span></p>

      <h2>Caution in reconstruction</h2>

      <p class=normal>Increasingly, archaeological reconstructions are used in 

        cinemagraphic-digital formats or 3D interactive environments. These virtual 

        models are criticized for their ability to portray scientific speculation 

        as 'truth'. In general the more advanced the level of technology 

        used in the reconstruction and display, the greater the belief in its 

        authenticity (Emele, 2000). This mechanism is also reinforced when reconstructions 

        are displayed in the context of museums with the inherent authority these 

        institutions confer to the works. </p>

      <p class=normal>Virtual archaeology has been accused of being more 'an 

        artistic task than an inferential process' (Forte, 2000). Uncritical 

        acceptance of the product has led to a point where '<span lang=EN-GB>fundamental 

        questions relating to issues such as what we actually mean by virtual 

        reality, and what our expensively assembled models truly represent have 

        been left largely unexplored' </span>(Emele, 2000). <span lang=EN-GB></span></p>

      <p class=normal>As Barceló (2000) notes:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>...future advancement of virtual reality techniques 

        in archaeology should not be restricted to &quot;presentation&quot; techniques, 

        but to explanatory tools...</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>...VR techniques [are] not only for description, 

        but for expressing all the explanatory process. An explanation can be 

        presented as a visual model, which is as a virtual dynamic environment, 

        where the user asks questions in the same way a scientist use a theory 

        to understand the empirical world (Barceló, 2000). </p>

      <p class=normal>The perspectives introduced above were to act as both visionary 

        statements and cautionary notes to the visualisation project. Against 

        the potential of a digitally reconstructed archaeological model, the project 

        was constrained in a number of ways with regard to the final product. 

        Resource restrictions (time and computing power) meant that it was necessary 

        to fix an approximate date in the history of Olympia rather than use the 

        model to examine the changes at Olympia over time. Interactivity was also 

        restricted to force the users to complete a tour of the site (with choices 

        along the way) in 20 minutes, rather than allowing free interaction. Juxtaposition 

        of the reconstruction and the archaeological site was introduced by the 

        use of panoramas from the Olympia site as it appeared in March 2000. </p>

      <p class=normal>The paper will now introduce the Exhibition that gave the 

        opportunity for the creation of the works and the impetus for the Web. 

      </p>

      <h2>The Exhibition <i>1000 years...</i></h2>

      <p class=normal>In 2000 Sydney hosted the 25<sup>th</sup> Olympiad and was 

        also the recipient of the most significant selection of antiquities from 

        ancient Greece ever seen in Australia. Sydney's Powerhouse Museum featured 

        54 ancient objects - most of them usually on permanent display in their 

        museums of origin in Greece, and many being famous icons of Greek art. 

        The exhibition,<i> 1000 Years of the Olympic Games: treasures of ancient 

        Greece </i>(July -- November 2000) captured some of the magic that 

        constituted the essence of Olympia, and the vibrant ancient Greek society 

        in which it thrived. The majority of objects coming from Greece to the 

        Powerhouse Museum, including sculpture, grave markers, votive offerings, 

        ceramic vessels and sporting equipment, date from around 700 to 200 BC. 

        This slice of time is one of the most energetic periods of human endeavour 

        ever recorded. Subdivided chronologically for our convenience into the 

        Archaic (about 660-480 BC), Classical (480-323 BC) and Hellenistic (323-27 

        BC) Periods, it was during this time that the essentials of western life 

        were defined - including philosophy, poetry, drama, architecture, art, 

        and sport (Donnelley, 2000). </p>

      <p class=normal>Due to a significant sponsorship offer by the Intel Corporation, 

        the Exhibition had two interactive components - the digital reconstruction 

        of Olympia and the 3D Zeus - incorporated into it. Most importantly (according 

        to sponsors wishes), both of these works would be translated for the Internet 

        in a state-of-the-art Web. Data acquisition was a major task in creating 

        the initial exhibits. </p>

      <p class=normal>The site of Olympia is in fertile countryside squeezed by 

        the steep and tree covered Mount Kronos into the elbow of two rivers - 

        the Alpheios and Kladeos. Archaeology and historical records show that 

        little has changed at this site over the past few millennia. In the prehistoric 

        period, its verdant topography inspired the worship of nature gods and 

        set it on a course for greatness as one of the glories of ancient Greece. 

        This isolated glade was to spend 1000 years as one of the most important 

        religious sanctuaries in Greece, with its Olympic Games a fundamental 

        component of worship to the supreme deity in the ancient Greek pantheon: 

        Zeus (Donnelley, 2000). </p>

      <p class=normal>A team comprised of a curator, archaeologist, surveyors 

        and photographers traveled from Australia to Greece early this year to 

        capture the data sets in high resolution using laser scanning and digital 

        photography. Most of the archaeological remains at Olympia are scattered 

        across the site, the result of two earthquakes of the 6<sup>th</sup> Century 

        AD and numerous floods. Those foundations that survive date to different 

        periods, from the Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic and Roman times. </p>

      <p class=normal>The excavations at Olympia were begun in May 1829, by French 

        archaeologists. The initial finds (metopes from the opisthodomus and parts 

        of the metopes from the pronaos of the Temple of Zeus) were transferred 

        to the Louvre where they are still being exhibited. When the Greek government 

        was informed of the looting of artefacts, the excavation was stopped. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>Excavations were started again 45 years later by German 

        archaeologists. Research continues today by the German Institute of Archaeology 

        in Athens and the Ephorate of Antiquities in Olympia. The Museum of Olympia 

        associated with the archaeological site houses many of the sculptural 

        and object material that has been recovered from the site. Supplementary 

        material on the archaeological site and its associated Museum can be found 

        on the Hellenic Ministry of Culture's Web (<a href="http://www.culture.gr/" target="new">http://www.culture.gr/</a>).</p>

      <p class=normal>The bibliography on Olympia runs to hundreds of items, although 

        those dealing strictly with the archaeology of the site can be counted 

        in the mere dozens. The most important sets of documents for the reconstructions 

        were some of the oldest. It almost goes without saying that any work on 

        Olympia would be nearly impossible without Pausanias' <i>Guide to 

        Greece </i>(2<sup>nd</sup> AD)<i>.</i> </p>

      <p class=normal>The five text volumes of the earliest German series, <i>Olympia. 

        Die Ergebnisse der vom Deutschen Reich veranstalteten Ausgrabung</i> (Adler 

        et. al. (1892-1897); referred to hence as the Adler and Curtius publications) 

        contain incredibly detailed descriptions of buildings and objects, complemented 

        by the hundreds of plans, sections, drawings and reconstructions in the 

        accompanying folio volumes. Subsequent important updates have been published 

        by Ashmole &amp; Yalouris (1967); Grunauer (1971) and (1981); Miller (1971); 

        Mallwitz (1972); Herrmann (1972); Koenigs (1984) (Da Costa et al, 2000). 

      </p>

      <h2><a name="_Toc492291492">Archaeological and historical considerations</a></h2>

      <p class=normal>The project team decided to attempt to reconstruct Olympia, 

        as it had been around 200 BC. Of course, it is actually impossible to 

        pick a single year to reconstruct an ancient site, given the relative 

        coarseness of archaeological chronology. At a site like Olympia, used 

        without interruption for over a thousand years, almost certainly with 

        frequent refurbishment of quite old buildings, it is really only possible 

        to establish the rough date a building was erected. Whether a building 

        was undergoing renovation in a particular year cannot be stated. The length 

        of time it took to complete buildings is also another issue. </p>

      <p class=normal>The choice of 200 BC was therefore made for mainly practical 

        reasons: the later the date in the site's history, the more buildings 

        there would be, and the more interesting a virtual tour for modern visitors 

        would be and would more closely correspond to the extant ruins; it was 

        an Olympic year; it was just before the Roman annexation of Greece began. 

        We acknowledge the date was stretched slightly in order to incorporate 

        the entire gymnasium and the <i>krypte</i><a

name="_Toc492291493"> entrance to the stadium. </a></p>

      <h2>Individual buildings</h2>

      <p class=normal>The Adler and Curtius publications provided detailed ground 

        plans of most buildings. As well, the elevations were usually calculated, 

        and the extant decorative elements, mainly terracotta <i>simae</i> and 

        <i>akroteria</i>, were associated with each building. Major additions 

        or changes to some buildings were taken from the later publications. The 

        drawings were used directly by the modellers to recreate each building. 

        An attempt was made to incorporate as much small detail as possible given 

        the limits of time and computing power (both in rendering and delivering 

        the animated tour). For example, the Adler and Curtius volumes contained 

        the differing capitals and columns of the Heraion, and these were included 

        in the model.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="kenderdine.fig2.jpg" width="400" height="393" alt="Fig 2. Work in progress, rendering the Pryaneion. &copy; Powerhouse Museum. "></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Fig 2. Work in progress, rendering the Pryaneion. &copy; 

        Powerhouse Museum. </p>

      <p class=normal>Inevitably, there was missing information, and the limited 

        timeframe meant that not every known detail could be incorporated. The 

        application of colour, which is now standard in our concept of ancient 

        Greek architecture and art, is still difficult because of the lack of 

        evidence. One particular difficulty in using the early German work is 

        that the colour plate published (Volume II, plate CXII) does not correspond 

        with the text description of colours or placement, even though it is supposed 

        to be the template for the painting of Doric buildings at Olympia. This 

        is partly a factor of colour printing techniques in 1896 and the fact 

        that we had the 1966 reprint, and also due to the difficulty of really 

        knowing what colours such as "mild whitish cobalt blue" or "a strong but 

        at the same time transparent blue" actually were. However, we followed 

        the Adler and Curtius publications as closely as possible in terms of 

        applying colour to the buildings, and the evidence of the terracotta roof 

        decorations excavated at the site was particularly helpful in this regard. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>Buildings which must have had pedimental sculpture or for 

        which some fragments of sculpture remain, such as the Metroon, were given 

        pale blue pediments, rather than attempting a poor reconstruction. Doors 

        and lattice screens were based on those depicted on black and red figure 

        vases.</p>

        of Zeus, The Apples of the Hesperides. Drawing David Loong. &copy; Powerhouse 

        Museum. </p>

      <p class=normal>Probably the least satisfactory outcome, given the time 

        restrictions on the project, related to the addition of statuary to the 

        Altis area of Olympia. Literally hundreds of dedicatory statues and objects 

        would have been placed into the sacred area, but we were able to reconstruct 

        only a handful, modelled on excavated statue bases and the descriptions 

        in Pausanias. </p>

      <p class=normal>Our most ambitious reconstruction was the interior of the 

        Temple of Zeus. This was based only on Pausanias' descriptions as 

        no evidence remains. It is thought that some coins and Christian icons 

        reflect the seated Zeus figure, once one of the wonders of the ancient 

        world, but they have already past through the filter of later cultural 

        biases.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="kenderdine.fig5.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Fig 5. Reconstruction of the Temple of Zeus. &copy; Powerhouse Museum. "></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Fig 5. Reconstruction of the Temple of Zeus. &copy; Powerhouse 

        Museum. </p>

      <p class=normal>A further discussion on the basis for reconstruction is 

        available from the project web (<a href="http://www.phm.gov.au/greek/4/pdf/archaeological_basis.pdf" target="new">http://www.phm.gov.au 

        /greek/4/pdf/archaeological_basis.pdf</a>). </p>

      <h2>The digital model</h2>

      <p class=normal>The topography of the site and the locations of key structures 

        were surveyed by members of the team so that the present surface (which 

        approximates the original ground level of the site) could be used in the 

        visualisations. This was performed using surveying equipment loaned by 

        the National Technical University in Athens. A digital elevation model 

        was prepared from this data, and combined with a detailed terrain model 

        of Kronos Hill obtained from large-scale topographic maps. In addition, 

        the surrounding landscape was also modelled from smaller scale topographic 

        series maps. As a result, the landscape of ancient Olympia used in the 

        visualisations is a very close approximation to the terrain of the period. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>Every graphic element was created for the project. Existing 

        digital Greek architectural elements would not have allowed us to maintain 

        a sufficiently high level of contextual accuracy. For example, the Temple 

        of Hera (where the Olympic torch is ignited) has every column different 

        as it was constructed and reconstructed over a long period of time. Standard 

        commercial digital library elements did not easily modify; in all cases 

        it was easier to create new elements. The human figures and statues were 

        modelled originally in Poser V4, and modified in 3D Max. </p>

      <h2>Display</h2>

      <p class=normal>The delivery of the VR reconstruction posed many challenges. 

        The intention was to provide a 3D 'experience' of Olympia to 

        an audience of up to 20 people at a time using affordable technology. 

        A rear-projection polarised projection system with inexpensive plastic 

        glasses was developed. Two JVC DLA-C15 rear projection capable projectors 

        were used to overlap the left and right channel images onto a 3m wide 

        screen in a 5m square room.<span lang=EN-GB></span></p>

      </p>

      <h2>Future </h2>

      <p class=normal>The virtual reconstruction of Olympia was intended for the 

        general public (with limited interactivity) rather than for use as a teaching 

        tool. However, the underlying dataset of the model does allow for scientific 

        <span class="Normal">use. Some areas for investigation include</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Modelling sun in relation to temples</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Modelling the earthquake effect on the Temple 

          of Zeus</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Model allows for further research about the 

          use of the sanctuary and liturgical practice</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Choices for colour applications invite responses 

          from the academic community.<span lang=EN-GB> </span></span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>Statue of Zeus</h1>

      <p class=normal>One of the most significant sculptures in the National Archaeological 

        Museum in Athens is the statue of Zeus from Artemision (Artemesium), also 

        considered to be perhaps a statue of Poseidon. This bronze sculpture is 

        slightly larger than life size, and was found in 1926 in the sea off Cape 

        Artemision. It is one of the few surviving examples of Early Classical 

        statuary. The laser scan of the Zeus allowed this object to travel, in 

        a virtual sense, from Athens to Sydney.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="kenderdine.fig7.jpg" width="400" height="183" alt="Fig 7. Laser scanning the statue of Zeus at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, March 2000. Photo University of Melbourne. &copy; Powerhouse Museum. "></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Fig 7. Laser scanning the statue of Zeus at the National 

        Archaeological Museum in Athens, March 2000. Photo University of Melbourne. 

        &copy; Powerhouse Museum. </p>

      <h2>A laser scan</h2>

      <p class=normal>A Modelmaker Laser Scanner mounted on a Faro 3D Coordinate 

        Measurement Arm was used to create high-resolution point clouds of the 

        surface of the statue. A purpose-built scaffold was fabricated in Athens 

        to enable elevation of the scanner to the top of the statue while ensuring 

        a stable fixture. The entire sculpture was digitised over several daytime 

        sessions in multiple parts. There were considerable restrictions on this 

        part of the project, which included no method of re-orienting the scanning 

        system datum and a very short working period in the Museum. </p>

      <p class=normal>The data resulting from the laser scanning operation consisted 

        of very dense clouds of points representing the surface of the statue 

        with a coordinate accuracy of around 0.2mm. This presented many difficulties 

        as the data sets were huge and needed substantial filtering before they 

        were useful. The decimation process reduced the density of the data points 

        without reducing the high level of detail in the model. The process used 

        a variety of software packages, finally resulting in 3D Studio Max model 

        of the statue. This contained over 2 million polygons. </p>

      <h2>Presentation</h2>

      <p class=normal>The Zeus model was presented in a separate virtual reality 

        booth at the Exhibition. It was displayed using shuttered glasses technology 

        driven by proprietary software running on Intergraph hardware. </p>

      <p class=normal>A limited amount of interactivity was provided where users 

        could rotate the model about its vertical axis, and zoom in and out. A 

        higher degree of interactivity was not appropriate given the respect accorded 

        the actual object itself, and therefore, its facsimile! (Da Costa et al, 

        2000). </p>

      <p class=normal>The aforementioned works - Olympia and the Zeus - were 

        both then translated into the products for a state-of-the-art Web. </p>

      <h1>Web site (<a href="http://www.phm.gov.au/ancient_greek_olympics" target="new">http://www.phm.gov.au/ancient_greek_olympics</a>)</h1>

      <p class=normal>Despite the great opportunity to produce these aforementioned 

        interactive Exhibition materials, the sponsors of the project (Intel Corporation) 

        and the Museums' main interest involved the production of a state-of-the-art 

        Web. This Web was intended to augment the Exhibition, and to demonstrate 

        the viability of the Internet to supplement and extend materials offered 

        locally in the Museum. The ability to give access to this material to 

        wide audiences and the fact that it will eventually outlive the Exhibition 

        by two years is also the advantage of this medium.</p>

      <p class=normal>To meet the sponsors' expectations, this Web was constructed 

        to demonstrate the use of state-of-the-art technologies for the delivery 

        of rich cultural content. The web was designed with a two-week exclusive 

        period for the Intel Web Outfitter Service in the United States, where 

        subscribers have a minimum of a PIII chip and are regularly updated with 

        the latest plugins. From the Museum's perspective the opportunity 

        to design a product with a high degree of sophistication outweighed the 

        concerns over download times and minimum browser specifications. The Web 

        was ultimately intended for academic, school and researcher markets. </p>

      <h2>Architecture, design and programming</h2>

      <p class=normal>The web was scripted as active server packages. A flash 

        based navigation system was used. There was high use of 360<span>°</span> 

        panoramas constructed with Live Picture from Reality Studio. Apart from 

        the standard plugins such as Abode Acrobat Reader, the main plugin is 

        the Zoom Viewer by MGISoft. The latter has two main utilities: it allows 

        the high-resolution images to be stored on the server and streamed to 

        the user on demand; and it prevents the users from saving the materials 

        to their hard drives. This last feature is of extreme importance to the 

        Greek Hellenic Ministry of Culture and the Museum who wish to protect 

        copyright. As noted, none of the Exhibition artefacts (also on display 

        on the Web) had travelled outside Greece before. With a history of contentious 

        international relations over Greek antiquities, it was very important 

        to all those involved that every measure be taken to prevent unwanted 

        use of the digital materials. VRML was not considered to be a robust or 

        user-friendly environment for translation of the Olympia reconstruction. 

        However visualisation in 3D is certainly the way forward for the display 

        of these materials in the future, and major developments continue in this 

        field. </p>

      <p class=normal>The web is constructed in six sections. These are: </p>

      <p class=normal><b>1. The Exhibition</b>: a series of zoomable panoramas

      <h2>Promotion and marketing</h2>

      <p class=normal>The Web was launched just prior to the Olympic Games. It 

        benefited from a high degree of marketing through its association with 

        the Intel Web Outfitter Services and was featured on the homepage for 

        the Intel.com Web for a short time in the United States and Australia. 

        The site was translated into three other languages: Korean, Chinese and 

        Japanese. In conjunction with children, the Premier of the State for New 

        South Wales launched it. There was a high degree of media coverage derived 

        from the Web launch and also from the Exhibition itself. </p>

      <h2>Analysis</h2>

      <p class=normal>Statistical data has so far been analysed for the four-month 

        period of the Exhibition -- from the beginning of August, 2000 until 

        the end of November, 2000. The author acknowledges the restricted nature 

        of basic statistics to determine true use of the Web. However, general 

        statistics are presented here to demonstrate several observable trends. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>The average number of hits per day over this period totalled 

        18,500. Other broad general-level statistics include these: the average 

        number of visitor sessions of 52, 582, and the average visitor length 

        of 12 minutes. The majority of visitors were from outside Australia (international 

        at 55% and unknown at 29%). </p>

      <p class=normal>A more thorough examination of the period shows a predictable 

        variation in the data display. The most active day of use was during the 

        Olympic period and on September 16, 2000 with 92,352 hits. Weekdays rather 

        than weekends showed a larger number of hits although it was after-hours 

        that numbers were marginally higher. This contradicts our initial expectations 

        that the high bandwidth required to access the site would preclude extensive 

        home use. </p>

      <p class=normal>What is potentially of more interest is the length of stay 

        by each visitor: 45% of visitors accessed just the first two pages of 

        the Web. There was a corresponding drop off as the number of pages increasesd. 

        However, a relatively high proportion (8% of the visitors) was staying 

        over 20 minutes to access 43% of the total page views. This last statistic 

        would suggest that those visitors who were interested in the site found 

        rich and rewarding content. At one point in the 4-month period over 18% 

        of the visitors were staying more than 20 minutes. In Web lingo this has 

        been referred to as Web "stick-ability" (and hopefully not a measure of 

        slow content download!). </p>

      <p class=normal>The Web will be hosted on the Museum server for two years. 

        As is so often the case, the overall development time for the entire project 

        was just 4 months -- including the Exhibition 3D materials. This prevented 

        extensive usability testing before launch, and represents a classic scenario 

        in museum projects. During the upcoming period it will be possible to 

        further analyse the Web use in schools and tertiary institutions. There 

        have been numerous complimentary emails from such organisations about 

        the quality of the scholastic research, although there have also been 

        requests for a CD ROM version to allay the heavy bandwidth requirements.</p>

      <h2>Awards</h2>

      <p class=normal>The overall project has won many awards in the short time 

        since its launch. The most important of these include a Virtual System 

        and Multimedia award for the Best Virtual World Heritage reconstruction; 

        the Best of the Best web for the Australian Interactive Multimedia Industry 

        Awards; the Best Interface Design at AIMIA; Hitwise Top 10 for Education 

        and Research 2000; and the Web was a finalist in the British Association 

        for Film and Television Interactive Entertainment Awards 2000 (short-listed 

        to one of three along with the multi-million dollar 'Walking with 

        Dinosaurs'). The judges described it: </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>A fascinating and highly interactive site, this is elegantly 

        designed and technically impressive and brings you closer to Olympian 

        Greece with effortless navigation and appropriate use of all media, including 

        superb panoramic photography and walk through 3D architecture. It is a 

        state-of-the-art web with an excellent interface and very high-quality 

        content. A technical tour de force deploying a broad range of impressive 

        plig-ins to good effect (BAFTA awards catalog, 2000).</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class=normal>Any project of this nature is concerned with how to balance 

        'realism' with 'reality', and the decisions made in 

        the creation of digital reconstruction were further constrained by the 

        goals of the project, the intended audience, the desired product, the 

        quality of archaeological information, and technological capabilities. 

        In the construction of the Web, a further caveat on design decisions included 

        the use of state-of-the-art technologies, which must demonstrate impressive 

        content development and display for a sophisticated Web user demographic. 

        This questioned the Museum's role as a provider of 'access for 

        all', but at the same allowed for the Museum to push limits in Internet 

        design and technology using rich cultural content. </p>

      <p class=normal>The Web and its contents are being re-purposed for a DVD 

        ROM which will be distributed free of charge to all schools in the State 

        of New South Wales, Australia, and in limited numbers for other markets. 

        The 3D version of the digital reconstruction of Olympia has been sold 

        to three international Olympic museums, and is to be used in university 

        teaching in some form. </p>

      <p class=normal>The project is an example of a digital reconstruction project 

        that has been repurposed for a highly successful Web. It also demonstrates 

        that rigorous scholarship is a worthwhile investment and can command a 

        significant audience. The repurposing of the underlying content has enabled 

        the works to be developed for different platforms and delivery mechanisms. 

        The challenge lies in providing users with the ability to alter input 

        data to test their own hypotheses. The development of VRML worlds on the 

        Internet (ones that are robust in implementation) will hold much value 

        for museum Web developments. </p>

      <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

      <p class=AcknowedgementsText>This project was made possible through the 

        generous provision of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture, Athens (<a

href="http://www.culture.gr/" target="new">http://www.culture.gr</a>). A number 

        of people in the Ministry worked hard on our behalf to make the data collection 

        process possible. Sponsorship to complete the work was generously provided 

        by the Intel Corporation (<a href="http://www.intel.com.au/" target="new">http://www.intel.com.au/</a>). 

        MGI Software Ltd (<a href="http://www.mgisoft.com/" target="new">http://www.mgisoft.com</a>) 

        kindly supported the license for the Zoom Server software. </p>

      <p class=AcknowedgementsText>Thanks to co-developers Cliff Ogleby and John 

        Ristevski from the Geomatics Department at Melbourne University for their 

        work on the digital reconstruction of Olympia and the Zeus; to Vu Nguyen 

        and Asher Graham of Osmosis for their excellent rendering and animation 

        skills; to Kate Da Costa, archaeological advisor on the project, who was 

        an invaluable and seriously hardworking talent, without whom we would 

        have retired to Disney.... </p>

      <p class=AcknowedgementsText>The Web was conceived by the Powerhouse Museum. 

        The photographic work at the archaeological site was undertaken by Peter 

        Murphy, Sydney. It is his genius also that enabled much of the data that 

        is displayed on the Web. The overlays for the metopes were draw by a meticulous 

        David Loong.</p>

      <p class=AcknowedgementsText>The sonorous tones of David Rutledge were recorded 

        for the tour and used for a number of audio files on the Web site. </p>

      <p class=AcknowedgementsText>Thanks also go to Lefki Pavlidis for her assistance 

        with the data collection and laser scanning in Greece; and to Sebastain 

        Chan and Jessie for the installation tweeks that needed to be undertaken 

        for the virtual Olympia model. </p>

      <p class=AcknowedgementsText>Our time in Athens was also eased by the welcome 

        of the Australian Ambassador in Athens, Ross Burns, and consul Deborah 

        George. We are also indebted to Jan Casson-Medhurst at the Australian 

        Archaeological Institute at Athens. Thanks to Judith Swaddling at the 

        British Museum for her time in reference to the scale model of Olympia 

        housed at the Museum.</p>
