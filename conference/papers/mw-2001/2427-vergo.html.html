      <h1 align=center class="PaperTitle">"Less Clicking, More Watching": Results 

        from the User-Centered Design of a Multi-Institutional Web Site for Art 

        and Culture</h1>

      <p class=Author>John Vergo, Clare-Marie Karat, John Karat, Claudio Pinhanez, 

        Renee Arora, Thomas Cofino, Doug Riecken, Mark Podlaseck IBM T.J. Watson 

        Research Center, USA</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>This paper summarizes a 10-month long research project 

        conducted at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center aimed at developing the 

        design concept of a multi-institutional art and culture web site. The 

        work followed a user-centered design (UCD) approach, where interaction 

        with prototypes and feedback from potential users of the web site were 

        sought throughout all the phases of the design process. In the first phase 

        of the research, we conducted interviews with museum curators, issued 

        questionnaires to brick and mortar museum visitors, performed on-line 

        surveys with users of museum web sites, ran focus groups, and performed 

        usability walk-throughs of best-of-breed museum web sites and of our new 

        web site design ideas.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The results showed a surprisingly strong interest 

        in streaming multimedia, TV-like experiences where users watched experts 

        and artists talk about art and culture, augmented by links to additional 

        and in-depth information. Such a design strategy was clearly favored by 

        our subjects over more interactive experiences such as chat rooms, information 

        search systems, or user-curated tours. In other words, when users go to 

        a web site of arts and culture looking for entertaining and educational 

        content, they seem to be less interested in clicking to find information 

        than in watching people, especially experts and celebrities, present and 

        discuss artistic works from their perspective.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Based on the results of the first phase, we developed 

        a prototype of a web site based on the concept of &quot;tours&quot; --- 

        5-10 minute streaming multimedia experiences led by experts and artists, 

        accessible by users with normal telephone connections (56Kbps modems). 

        The tours resemble a slide show enhanced by narration, music, occasional 

        video clips, and hot spots for extra information. Two pilot tours were 

        fully produced and tested with users who reported great satisfaction with 

        the tours in terms of their entertainment, engagement, and educational 

        values. We also observed that the most satisfied users were those who 

        interacted and explored the least during a tour.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The research described in this paper suggests that 

        people interested in art and culture have an affinity for web sites where 

        they can have entertaining, curated experiences in many ways similar to 

        short TV-like documentaries. Yet there are many other occasions when 

        they are looking for engaging educational and entertaining experiences. 

        In such situations, less interactive but narratively structured streaming 

        experiences with a human voice seem to be a very appealing format to engage 

        and satisfy such users. Importantly, they do not see such experiences 

        as a substitute for actual visits to museums or attendance at live performances, 

        but as an enriching and highly accessible way to augment the cultural 

        experiences and performances they enjoy in brick and mortar cultural institutions 

        around the world. People are often looking for specific information about 

        artists and art works.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class=normal>In the summer of 1999, IBM decided to investigate the possibility 

        of sponsoring and creating a multi-institutional web site for art and 

        culture. The goal of this web site is to give users around the world ways 

        to increase their appreciation of artistic works, cultural treasures and 

        performances by providing information and learning opportunities about 

        art and culture.<b></b></p>

      <h2>User centered design</h2>

      <p class=Normal>User-centered design (UCD) is a design approach in which 

        multidisciplinary development teams create useful, usable and satisfying 

        user experiences. Central to UCD is the notion that the design process 

        is iterative, and is accomplished by nearly continual input from users. 

        As user input is collected and analyzed, it is fed back into the design 

        process, resulting in progressive refinement and improvement of the system 

        under design.</p>

      <p class=Normal>We follo<span class="normal">wed six general UCD (IBM, 2000) 

        principles which guided our activities:</span></p>

      <ol class="normal">

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Set goals for the project. This early phase of the 

          project is also the right point to spell out any competitive goals, 

          along with an identification of the primary competitors.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Understand users. Define the intended user population 

          and the context of use. The context of use includes the physical context 

          and the social context, if both are relevant.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Assess the competitiveness of the system under design. 

          If the goal is to design a system that breaks new ground, it is risky 

          to attempt such a design without a thorough understanding of the competitive 

          landscape. Having clearly stated goals for the intended user allows 

          testing of the system against competitive alternatives and comparing 

          the results.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Design every aspect of the user experience. Everything 

          a user sees and touches is designed together by a multidisciplinary 

          team. In the case of the design of a web site for art and culture, the 

          user experience goes well beyond the content to include navigating the 

          site, interacting with virtual exhibits, and even downloading and installing 

          browser plug-ins.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Create and evaluate designs iteratively with representative 

          samples of the targeted user population. User feedback is gathered early 

          and often, and this feedback drives design and development. In the early 

          phases of design, lower fidelity prototypes are presented to and tested 

          with the users. As the design team's understanding of the effectiveness 

          of various design alternatives and design elements is clarified, higher 

          fidelity prototypes are developed and tested. This allows inexpensive 

          testing of many ideas early in the design process. Once a design idea 

          (or set of design ideas) tests well with a low fidelity prototype, it 

          is less risky to commit development dollars and resources in pursuit 

          of the idea(s).</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Manage the project through continual user observation 

          and testing. Throughout the life of the project, continue to monitor 

          and listen to your target user group, and let the feedback inform any 

          modifications to the system design.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <p class=Normal>These guidelines are a set of heuristics that we typically 

        follow on any project. They provide tremendous flexibility with respect 

        to the precise activities a project team might employ and include a wide 

        range of established user research methods and participatory design methods 

        in use today. The next section explains the specific techniques we employed 

        on our project, along with the rationale for our choices. After each UCD 

        activity is presented, we report some of the most significant findings 

        resulting from the activity. Each activity yielded a wealth of data not 

        presented in this paper but publicly available (Karat 2001, Pinhanez 2001). 

        Those findings that support our ultimate design choices are presented, 

        along with findings of general interest to the Museums and the Web community.<b></b></p>

      <h1>Our UCD Approach</h1>

      <h2>Project goals</h2>

      <p class=normal>The initial requirements for the project were extremely 

        broad and open. We set out to create on the Web a major cultural destination 

        (not a portal) that would attract a large number of visitors. The site 

        had to provide access to content supplied by 5-10 of the largest and best-known 

        cultural institutions around the world. The institutions were chosen to 

        represent different areas of art and culture, including various performing 

        arts, fine arts, natural history and science. Finally, each exhibit on 

        the site needed to combine content from multiple institutions, to leverage 

        the powerful institutional partnerships and to ensure the uniqueness of 

        the site.</p>

      <p class=normal>An additional goal was that the web site must not be a database 

        of cultural artefacts or knowledge, but instead it must attract users 

        by enabling entertaining and educational experiences similar to those 

        provided by visiting a museum, attending a performance, or watching a 

        cultural TV program. The success of the web site would be measured by 

        its popularity and, specifically, by its rate of return visits. Given 

        the openness of the initial specifications of the project and the strong 

        requirement of users' satisfaction, we adopted a user-centered-design 

        (UCD) approach to the development of this web site.</p>

      <p class=normal>We ran five major user research activities in the discovery 

        phase of the project. We conducted interviews with museum curators, issued 

        questionnaires to brick and mortar museum visitors, performed on-line 

        surveys with users of museum web sites, ran focus groups, and performed 

        usability walk-throughs of best-of-breed museum web sites and of our new 

        web site design ideas. Before engaging in any of the user research activities, 

        we took the time to define our target user population.</p>

      <h2>Defining the target user population</h2>

      <p class=normal>Our definition of the target users for our project was initially 

        shaped by the project business goals. The sponsoring org<span class="normal">anization 

        within IBM came to us with some initial parameters. We eventually defined 

        our target users to include members of several different population segments:</span></p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"> <span class="normal">Adults 21-34 years old,</span></span></li>

        <li class="normal"> <span class="normal">Adults 35-50 years old, with and without children</span></span></li>

        <li class="normal"> <span class="normal">Adults 50 - 70 years old, and</span></span></li>

        <li class="normal"> <span class="normal">Children 9-15 years old, typically accompanied 

          by adults from segment "2", above</span></span></li>

      </ol>

      <p class=normal><span class="normal">While we did not target people 16-20 

        years old, we did not explicitly exclude them from our user population.</span></p>

      <p class=normal>We assumed that our typical users spend an average of 10 

        or more hours a week on a computer, and of that time, five or more hours 

        are spent on the Internet. They find out about sites from search engines, 

        advertisements, friends and family, and web surfing. They think that having 

        cultural events as a part of their lives is somewhat to very important. 

        We also anticipated that visitors see the site as a way of enriching their 

        experience at the brick and mortar center, not as a substitute for it.</p>

      <h2>Focus groups</h2>

      <p class=normal>Our first project activity was to run a series of six focus 

        group sessions, which were cond<span class="normal">ucted on the east 

        coast (New Jersey), mid-west (Michigan) and west coast (California). Each 

        group consisted of eight individuals, gender balanced. Two groups of age 

        groups 21-35, 35-50 and 50-70 were conducted. An independent, objective 

        third party moderated the sessions.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="normal">Some of the initial ideas that were 

        explored during the focus group session were:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="normal">Giving users the ability to create their own 

          exhibit</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">Live virtual tours where artists or curators 

          are available on-line, in real time, to conduct a tour</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=normal><span class="normal">During the focus group sessions, participants 

        were presented with verbal descriptions and simple visual representations 

        of the new design ideas, and were asked a wide range of questions with 

        the following objectives:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="normal">Gaining a better understanding of the target 

          audiences' use of cultural resources.</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">Uncovering consumers' experiences with 

          existing cultural web sites.</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">Understanding current web site usage and behaviour.</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">Assessing reactions to the proposed web site

        <li> <span class="normal">Understanding the receptivity to various payment

      </ul>

      <h2>Focus group results</h2>

      <p class=normal>Overall, the newly proposed web site features sparked favorable 

        reactions from consumers. "Live" tours were overwhelmingly considered 

        one of the most compelling and unique ideas proposed. They particularly 

        liked the opportunity to interact with artists and tour guides.</p>

      <p class=normal>Respondents were adamant that they should not be charged 

        a fee to use the features offered on the web site. Advertising banners 

        and third-party sponsorships were deemed the most acceptable means of 

        funding the site. However, it must be noted that the use of advertising 

        banners was a forced choice response. In the usability walkthroughs, people 

        were clear in their disdain for advertising banners.</p>

      <p class=normal>Most respondents viewed the newly proposed web site as a 

        supplemental source of information and/or enhancement to the actual live 

        cultural activity or event. While east-coast participants usually use 

        ticketing and venue web sites to gather logistical information regarding 

        a cultural activity, mid-west and west-coast respondents also venture 

        to cultural "home sites" for background information relating to the activity 

        or event. Most respondents conduct some form of preparatory research before 

        attending a cultural activity or event.</p>

      <p class=normal>Time, geographic limitations and financial constraints are 

        the primary factors that hinder respondents from attending cultural events 

        as often as they would like.</p>

      <h2>Curator interviews</h2>

      <p class=normal>We conducted a series of interviews with curators from two 

        partner institutions. Five curators were interviewed, with each session 

        lasting between one and two hours.</p>

      <p class=normal>The interviews were conducted with a specific set of goals 

        but did not follow a rigid script. We queried curators to understand the 

        design criteria for exhibits. We were interested in understanding if there 

        are differences between institutions on how design criteria are created 

        and implemented. We asked them how the design criteria affect the final 

        exhibit. We wanted to know if curators go through the explicit step of 

        defining the target audience for each exhibit. Finally, we asked the curators 

        how they (or their management) measure the success of their work.</p>

      <h2>Curator interview results</h2>

      <p class=normal>Curators at both partner institutions stated that most individual 

        exhibits are attractive to narrow audiences, and that many different types 

        of target audiences exist. Curators from both institutions expressed an 

        interest in drawing new people (i.e. new visitor segments) to the institution. 

        Curators at an institution indicated they specifically target 20-30 year 

        old visitors on a regular basis with the goal of establishing a satisfied 

        clientele that will engage in repeat visits to the institution for many 

        decades to come. Both institutions consider "families with children" a 

        target audience.</p>

      <p class=normal>All institutions have "dead zones", times when visitation 

        is slow, and they try to draw people in to the museum by putting on exhibits 

        that have appeal to a wide audience. The curators reported that their 

        institutions perceive a strong need to keep exhibits "fresh", in order 

        to attract repeat visitors.</p>

      <p class=normal>No institution employs a quantitative approach in measuring 

        success other than simply counting visitors. The institutions use ad hoc 

        observational techniques in the museums. They also gauge reactions through 

        published reviews in magazines and periodicals.</p>

      <h2>Usability walkthroughs</h2>

      <p class=normal>The usability walk-throughs were run in 12 sessions with 

        a total of 70 participants who were screened for cultural interest and 

        basic familiarity with the web. Subjects were first shown excerpts of 

        existing web sites related to culture. Groups of approximately six subjects 

        each were assembled in the TJ Watson Usability Lab in Hawthorne, NY. As 

        much as possible, the groups were composed of 50% women, 50% men, and 

        represented the diversity in income, education, background, race, and 

        ethnicity in the tri-state area.</p>

      <p class=normal>Each group was shown sections of two existing cultural web 

        sites (children were shown only one site), followed by two new design 

        ideas for the proposed site. After each demo, a facilitator led a group 

        discussion of their opinions of the content in the demo. Then participants 

        recorded their individual thoughts about the demo content (children had 

        no written part). Then the next demo was shown. At the end of the adult 

        session, participants were asked to answer several summary questions (children 

        did not do this part). Over the course of all the walkthroughs, five existing 

        web sites were shown and five new design ideas were presented.</p>

      <p class=normal>In the first part of the session, we showed existing web 

        sites where users <span class="normal">could navigate through 3D replicas 

        of exhibitions, interact with panoramic images, visually explore paintings 

        and 3D sculptures, write and publish stories about the content, and obtain 

        information about different layers of a painting.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="normal">The mockups of our new design ideas 

        shown in the second part of the usability walk-throughs included five 

        different possibilities for exploring cultural content:</span></p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> A filtering system based on direct manipulation of 

          large databases with visual feedback (such as in Alberg &amp; Shneiderman, 

          1994);</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A set of lenses (tools) to manipulate the way content 

          could be viewed (such as in Stone, Fishkin, and Bier, 1994);</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A chat system where people could talk about a particular 

          artwork (Viegas and Donath, 99)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> A notebook system where the user collects and comments 

          on artistic content, and later publishes the notebook for public/private 

          viewing;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"> <span class="normal">A multimedia system where the user watches guided 

          multimedia tours, interacting whenever interested in related information.</span></span></li>

      </ol>

      <h2>Usability walkthrough results</h2>

      <p class=normal>A major finding of the usability walk-throughs was that 

        most of the participants did not express interest in web sites that involved 

        active interaction with the content or other people, such as when using 

        a filtering system, creating a notebook, or chatting. The multimedia prototype 

        was clearly the best received among the design ideas. Among the existing 

        web sites, there was a preference for sites where the user was guided 

        through an experience or discovery process, and in this case, participants 

        strongly suggested the replacement of text by audio.</p>

      <p class=normal>We summarize those findings by hypothesizing that in this 

        kind of entertaining web experience, users want <i>less clicking, more 

        watching</i>. Users seem to be very comfortable with the idea of a streaming 

        web experience that leads them through artistic and cultural artefacts 

        where, unlike television, the stream can be paused, replayed, or interrupted 

        for further exploration. In fact, we found a strong desire for availability 

        of additional information through hypermedia links and in-depth analysis 

        of the works of art. Interestingly, some of the participants viewed the 

        more interactive design concepts and existing web sites as work, not entertainment.</p>

      <p class=normal>The idea of more passive experiences was further reinforced 

        by many complaints a<span class="normal">bout the difficulty of 3D interfaces, 

        the excess of textual information, and the amount of work required to 

        find information. The streaming multimedia concept seems to address this 

        major concern by neither requiring the user to learn and exercise a large 

        set of new skills nor requiring a large amount of attention and decision-making.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="normal">The usability walk-through also detected 

        a desire for a "human voice" behind the multimedia experience; that is, 

        a personal viewpoint in the exposition of the content. However, this voice 

        needs to have the authority of an expert in the field or the human interest 

        of a celebrity. In fact, a major complaint identified with chat systems 

        was precisely the lack of trust and perceived value in the information 

        provided by generic chatters.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="normal">We explicitly asked the usability walkthrough 

        participants what factors would be important in their decision to re-visit 

        the site on multiple occasions. The most frequent responses to this question 

        were:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="normal">The quality of the content</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">The ease of use of the site</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">Having a cultural calendar that would send them 

          reminders;</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">The quality of the images, video and audio</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">Having new exhibits</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">Access to archived old exhibits.</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=normal>The modal response to the question "How often should the 

        site be updated with new material" was one month, but there was considerable 

        variance in the data.</p>

      <h2>Web site surveys</h2>

      <p class=normal>The web surveys were conducted by using a questionnaire 

        that automatically popped up, in a separate window, whenever users accessed 

        the home page of two partner art museums. Answering the 17 questions was 

        optional, but throughout the month the survey was conducted, 830 and 1417 

        users answered the survey on each of the museum web sites. The survey 

        was centered on questions about how the respondents use the web to obtain 

        art and culture-related information and entertainment.</p>

      <h2>Web site survey results</h2>

      <p class=normal>About 81% of the surveyed visitors were visiting the web 

        sites for the first time. About half of them (45%) got to the site through 

        search engines and 17% through links from related sites. An estimated 

        10% came directly from other web pages.</p>

      <p class=normal>About 25% were researching information on specific content, 

        while 32% were interested in specific information about the museum (schedules, 

        access, etc.). About 12% were looking for fun-like activities and only 

        2.4% declared interest specifically in shopping.</p>

      <p class=normal>The absolute majority of the visitors (90%) were alone while 

        visiting the sites. The most important aspects in the visit were the "content" 

        (46%) and the ability to pre-visit the museum (31%). Only 14% ranked "usability" 

        as their major concern.</p>

      <p class=normal>About half of the visitors considered the sites "interesting", 

        21% saw them as "educational", and only 4% thought of the sites as "entertaining". 

        This, in some ways, correlates with the objectives of the visitors as 

        described above.</p>

      <p class=normal><span class="normal">Visitors considered actually getting 

        the information they wanted as the most engaging part of the experience 

        of the site (39%). Similarly, when asked what part of the experience could 

        not be replicated, 50% of the visitors mentioned the facility of getting 

        information, and 35% mentioned the convenience of visiting the museum 

        from home. The biggest frustrations with the web sites were</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="normal">The inaccessibility of the full content of the 

          museum (35%)</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">Not finding the sought-for information (16%)</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">The inability to access the schedule (9%)</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">The inability to ask questions of the curators 

          (5%)</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=normal><span class="normal">There was a slight predominance of 

        males (58%) amon</span>g visitors to the site. The age distribution was 

        quite homogeneous, with a strong participation of people in their forties 

        (22%) and fifties (11%).</p>

      <p class=normal>Most of the visitors (58%) belonged to families having more 

        than 5 hours/week of web usage and only 22% used the web less than 2 hours/week. 

        As for connection time, 76% had a connection equal to, or faster than, 

        56Kbps, and 99% have a 28.8Kbps or better connection available.</p>

      <p class=normal>To the users who answered the survey, the most popular education 

        web sites were Discovery (6%), Yahoo, PBS, and the New York Times. The 

        most popular entertainment web sites were Yahoo (6%), the Internet movie 

        database, ESPN, and the onion.</p>

      <h2>Brick and mortar visitor surveys</h2>

      <p class=normal>A total of 99 visitor surveys were conducted at two of our 

        partner institutions. The surveys at each institution were conducted on 

        multiple days in order to get information from weekend and weekday visitors, 

        as well as to survey individuals who might be visiting to attend a special 

        event at the institution.</p>

      <h2>Brick and mortar visitor survey results</h2>

      <p class=normal>People enjoy integrating cultural experiences into their 

        activities in order to create a rewarding social, entertainment, and educational 

        experience - also, visitors to the institution are interested in learning 

        and enriching themselves and their friends and families.</p>

      <p class=normal>Many people selected the institution they were visiting 

        because it provided an event that would satisfy both social and educational 

        goals. A visit could also be integrated with other social events (visitors 

        appeared to schedule a trip to the institution along with other activities 

        such as a walk in the park, shopping, and dining). A majority of visitors 

        visited to enrich themselves by viewing exhibits and special events. Many 

        visitors indicated that the use of different presentation techniques (e.g., 

        kiosks, films, human guides, lighting effects, etc.) greatly enhanced 

        the learning experience.</p>

      <p class=normal>The nature of the content dictates whether people are more 

        focused on entertainment than education, and is primarily responsible 

        for shaping the experience. As for the design of the web site, these surveys 

        point out that there should be different treatments and different goals 

        for different kinds of content. For instance, scientific content asks 

        for an experience designed to be more educational than entertaining, while 

        content related to comedy and drama should be entertaining and emotionally 

        engaging.</p>

      <p class=normal>There is a significant difference between the normal visitors 

        and the audience for special events. Special events are less "social" 

        than regular visits. In terms of the design of the site, this data should 

        inform the number of community-related features (for instance, chatting) 

        available for regular browsing visitors versus the audience for special 

        events.</p>

      <h1>Conclusions of the Discovery Phase UCD activities</h1>

      <p class=normal>From the responses of the web surveys, we found that only 

        a minority of people (4 to 5%) label the experience they have at museum 

        web sites as "entertaining". In many ways, the participants in our research 

        seem to lean towards defining an entertaining web experience as something 

        closer to traditional TV, but enriched by the opportunity to explore and 

        find extra information. However, our research also indicated that to access 

        the majority of our targeted audience today, such web experiences must 

        be available to users sporting modems of 56Kbits/second or more.</p>

      <p class=normal>Based on the results of the discovery phase, we developed 

        a design concept for the cultural web site based on the idea of multimedia 

        <i>tours</i> guided by experts and artists. In our design, a tour presents 

        information to the user continuously, from beginning to end, unless the 

        user signals a desire to explore extra material or to exercise control. 

        During the tour, opportunities to obtain additional information are presented 

        as hot spots on the screen. All of the extra information is also available 

        for exploration at the end of the tour.</p>

      <p class=normal>The proposed web site consists of a collection of tours 

        covering different areas of art and culture, such as painting, music, 

        theater, and sculpture. In order to satisfy a large number of users, it 

        seems to be necessary to provide a large number of tours and to add new 

        ones regularly. Some of the design decisions presented below are, therefore, 

        the result of the need to reduce production costs.</p>

      <p class=normal>To cope with the requirement of maximum 56K bandwidth, we 

        decided to explore multimedia experiences primarily based on still pictures 

        and sound, instead of low quality video. At 56Kbits/second, video tends 

        to become small and blurry, while at that speed it is possible to download 

        audio with reasonable quality and reasonably good-looking pictures. Dealing 

        mainly with stills also serves to reduce production costs, since shooting 

        video is normally quite a bit more expensive than just audio recording 

        and picture taking.</p>

      <p class=normal>In our design, the main multimedia experience, or simply 

        <i>main tour</i>, is enriched by the addition of user controls such as 

        pause/resume/rewind/forward and by the inclusion of hot spots for two 

        kinds of extra content: side tours and branches. A<i> side tour</i> is 

        an extra, self-contained segment of multimedia, normally focusing on more 

        specific aspects of the tour subject, which can be "inserted" into the 

        main tour. A <i>branch</i> is a static web page with text, pictures, and 

        links to extra information on a specific subject. The decision to create 

        a side tour instead of a branch is based on the expected reach of the 

        content. Since side tours are much more costly to produce than branches, 

        we tend to produce side tours only for highly desirable extra information.</p>

      <p class=normal>Figure 1 shows a snapshot of a tour. Most of the area is 

        used by the content being presented by the tour (pictures, text, occasionally 

        very short segments of video). On the bottom left side, a pictorial map 

        gives the user a basic idea of the duration of the different scenes of 

        the tour and the elapsed time. Rolling the mouse over the map brings extra 

        textual information about each scene, while clicking on the picture of 

        a scene interrupts the current scene and immediately starts the scene 

        corresponding to the clicked image.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="vergo.fig1.jpg" width="539" height="256" alt="Figure 1 Typical scene of a tour with its navigation map, including links to a side tour and two branches"></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1 Typical scene of a tour with its navigation 

        map, including links to a side tour and two branches</p>

      <p class=normal>As the tour progresses, hot spots indicating side tours 

        and branches appear on the screen. When a side tour is selected, the main 

        tour is interrupted and the side tour is played. When the side tour finishes, the main tour automatically resumes from the point where it was left. 

        A click on a branch pauses the tour and opens a new window on the browser, 

        displaying the web page associated with the branch. To resume the playing 

        of the main tour, the user is required to click on the pause/resume marker 

        above the map.</p>

      <p class=normal>When the tour finishes, all the content - main tour, side 

        tours, branches - of the tour becomes easily available on the <i>explore 

        page</i>. Figure 2 depicts the explore page associated with the tour offig. 

        1. Clicking on the tour map restarts the tour from the beginning of the 

        scene that was clicked. Similarly, clicking on side tours and branches 

        immediately starts them. The explore page is automatically presented to 

        the user at the end of the main tour. However, during any moment of the 

        main tour, the user can access the explore page by clicking on the corresponding 

        hot spot on the right of the map (fig. 1).</p>

      <h1>The Two Pilot Tours</h1>

      <p class=normal>The design concept described above instructed the development 

        of two pilot tours that are the main instruments used in the evaluation 

        methods later described by Pinhanez and Karat (Pinhanez 2001, Karat C. 

        2001, Pinhanez 2001).</p>

      <p class=normal>The first tour features the work of a toy pianist, Margaret 

        Leng Tan. In the tour, the pianist talks about her involvement with toy 

        pianos, how music is arranged for a toy piano, and her connections to 

        Schr&ouml;eder, the famous cartoon character created by Charles Schulz. Two 

        side tours describe the history and functioning of toy pianos and the 

        work of Margaret Leng Tan before becoming a toy pianist. The main tour 

        lasts 4m15s, and the side tours take 1m18s and 50s, respectively. The 

        tour also includes five branches.</p>

      <p class=normal>The second tour talks about Ludwig van Beethoven and his 

        Ninth Symphony. In this tour, a narrator leads the user through aspects 

        of Beethoven's life and work, with comments also by a maestro and 

        a concert pianist. Three side tours are provided, one about Beethoven's 

        deafness and two others that let the user explore Beethoven's scores 

        and his famous Heiligenstaden testament. Beethoven's main tour lasts 

        10m10s and the first side tour 2m00s. The other side tours, since they 

        incorporate interactive elements, have no fixed duration, although their 

        exploration usually takes around 60s each. There are also 5 branches available 

        for user exploration.</p>

      <p class=normal>After completing the development of the prototypes, we again 

        engaged a sample of our target user population in a usability study to 

        assess the success and value of our designs. The prototypes were tested 

        with men and women from 21-55 years old. Test results indicate high user 

        satisfaction with the tours. Users interacted relatively infrequently 

        with the tours, and the less they interacted, the more they reported feeling 

        engaged and entertained by the experience. This supports our initial hypothesis 

        that the tours are most entertaining when they are experienced as they 

        were designed to be; that is, watched as a TV-like experience. The results 

        of the usability study give support to the contrarian "less clicking, 

        more watching" design approach identified in the discovery phase.</p>
