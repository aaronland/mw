      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class=normal>Bayou Bend is the name of the home of Miss Ima Hogg, the 

        daughter of the first native-born governor of Texas, and a longtime Houston 

        philanthropist. Throughout her life, Miss Hogg assembled an important 

        collection of American decorative arts that included furniture, paintings, 

        sculpture, ceramics, and glass. In 1957, Miss Hogg donated both her home 

        and extensive collection to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH). Over 

        the next ten years, her residence was converted into a house museum, which 

        opened to the public in 1966. </p>

      <p class=normal>Miss Hogg was active in the museum until her death in 1975. 

        Bayou Bend continues to add to Miss Hogg's collection to this day. This 

        house museum, sitting upon 14 acres of formal and woodland gardens, represents 

        one of the nation's finest collections of American decorative arts from 

        the period 1620 to 1870. Today, the objects in the collection are among 

        the finest examples of American design and craftsmanship, but they also 

        reflect the tastes, values, and aspirations of ordinary Americans. The 

        collection fulfills Miss Hogg's dream that Bayou Bend will serve as a 

        bridge between Texas and the rest of the nation and, in her own words, 

        &quot;bring us closer to the heart of an American heritage which unites 

        us&quot; (Warren, Brown, Coleman, &amp; Neff, 1998).</p>

      <h1>The Beginning of a Museum-University Partnership</h1>

      <p class=normal>H. L. Menken said, "For every complex problem, there is 

        a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong." Unfortunately Menken never 

        recorded his opinion of collaboration, which can be thought of as a complex 

        and messy but correct solution to a simple problem. Museums often collaborate 

        on exhibitions -- one institution publishes the catalog, another does 

        the conservation, and a third handles the shipping; universities collaborate 

        on everything from the Internet to athletics; but museums and universities 

        collaborate much less often. One good reason for this is that each operates 

        on a different schedule. Exhibitions, which shape the calendar of most 

        museums, may require years of planning and preparation, but they come 

        and go in six to eight weeks. Courses, which shape university calendars, 

        typically run four months, and students change with each semester. Even 

        university museums find it difficult to get a class of students involved 

        in the development of exhibitions. So, it required more than a little 

        optimism to think that several classes of university students could collaborate 

        with the small staff at a historic house museum to create an attractive, 

        innovative Web site. The challenge from those who were less optimistic 

        took a slightly different form depending on which institution they represented. 

        Doubters at the university asked, "Why are our students creating a Web 

        site for the museum for free?" And their counterparts at the museum asked, 

        "What can some college students do that a professional Web design firm 

        can't do better?"<br>

        For art museums, as for other institutions, the rapid development of the 

        Web has created opportunities to reach out to new audiences. Fortunately, 

        the museum divisions of the National Endowments for the Humanities and 

        the National Endowment for the Arts have responded with a variety of grant 

        programs to support innovative uses of the Web. These funding initiatives 

        recognize the essential dilemma of art museums and similar institutions: 

        they collect rare and unique objects, which they are chartered to exhibit 

        to the largest number of people consistent with sound conservation practices. 

        An NEA grant program that sought &quot;innovative uses of new technology 

        that enhance public access to the arts&quot; seemed tailor made to overcome 

        the challenges faced by a collection of decorative arts exhibited in a 

        historic house. At Bayou Bend, access is limited to groups of no more 

        than six visitors, accompanied by a trained docent, and scheduled 15 minutes 

        apart. A Web site offered the possibility to reach a much wider and more 

        diverse audience, with the potential to develop features specifically 

        for K-12 classes, scholars, and others. The NEA review panel agreed and 

        funded the proposal, but at a fraction of the amount requested. A fortuitous 

        meeting with faculty from the University of Houston College of Education 

        Instructional Technology Program led to a collaboration that has not only 

        made up for the lost funding, but has also given graduate students valuable 

        hands-on experience.</p>

      <h1>Design of a Museum Project-Based University Course</h1>

      <p class=normal>In the spring semester of 1998, graduate students and faculty 

        members at the University of Houston began to design a Web site for the 

        Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens at the request of the MFAH. Wanting 

        to create more than just a "virtual advertisement" for Bayou Bend, the 

        MFAH hoped to extend the richness of the collection and gardens to visitors 

        and non-visitors alike, and especially to appeal to a large number of 

        teachers and students, from elementary classrooms to graduate school, 

        who visit and study the museum. Through a series of meetings between MFAH 

        staff and faculty from the University of Houston, it was decided that 

        an interactive Web site would be developed to showcase the Bayou Bend 

        Collection as well as reach out to the community through the development 

        of educational materials that support the mission of the Bayou Bend Collection 

        and Gardens. To accomplish this goal, a graduate course in the College 

        of Education's Instructional Technology Program was created, in which 

        students worked in small, collaborative teams to help design and develop 

        a Web site, which included lesson plans, a research guide, and other interactive 

        elements. The course, Project-Based Web Design and Development, is now 

        offered every fall and spring, with a group of 10 to 12 masters and doctoral 

        students participating each semester.</p>

      <p class=normal>Over successive semesters, students in the course have examined 

        how a conceptual framework can be used in the production of the Bayou 

        Bend Web site. In so doing, they have explored how various theoretical 

        principles can be used in the design and development of a comprehensive 

        site that can meet the needs of a varied population of users, including 

        K-12 students, researchers, art educators, members of the Houston community, 

        and Web visitors from around the world. Major themes of the course include 

        exploration of how students, instructors, facilitators, and content experts 

        work together in all facets of the design and development process. This 

        provides many opportunities for participants in the course to discuss 

        techniques and strategies for accomplishing tasks, in a traditional classroom 

        environment and also while working online in virtual teams. The Web site 

        for Bayou Bend is online at: <a href="http://www.bayoubend.uh.edu/" target="new">http://www.bayoubend.uh.edu</a>.</p>

      <h1>The Challenges Involved</h1>

      <p class=normal>There are numerous challenges involved in designing and 

        developing a museum Web site of this type and in facilitating a graduate 

        course that involves students as the instructional designers and Web designers 

        and developers. In developing the Bayou Bend Web site, the role of student 

        designers is fourfold. First, the overall appearance and feel of the sight 

        need to fit with the mission of Bayou Bend and its relationship to the 

        Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Second, a multitude of users and platforms 

        must be considered, which results in a number of decisions such as screen 

        size, table construction, and the use of Web-safe colors. Third, consideration 

        must be given to the educational purpose of the site at each stage of 

        development. This is necessary not only to insure that the material is 

        accurate and useful to teachers and students, but also that navigation, 

        page design, and technological innovation work together to support and 

        extend the educational content without overshadowing the informational 

        mission of the museum. Finally, dealing with the extensive amount of content 

        requires that the file structure be flexible and well organized to facilitate 

        both present and future development and expansion, a process that requires 

        extensive planning and thought.</p>

      <p class=normal>The beginning stumbling block was one between experts and 

        neophytes. At the beginning of the project, staff members at Bayou Bend 

        had no access to the Internet, and were completely unfamiliar with it. 

        Therefore, there was some time before staff members were able to understand 

        the basics of what the students would be able to do in creating the Web 

        site, let alone the more sophisticated things. Had museum staff been Internet 

        savvy at the beginning of the project, it most certainly would have gone 

        more smoothly. Another challenge was that while it was intended from the 

        beginning that existing printed texts would be used as the basic material 

        for the project, it became clear early on that materials specifically 

        developed for the Web would be needed. Dealing with changing client needs 

        and wants, working with minimal funding, and bringing new students into 

        the project have been additional obstacles that team members have faced. 

        Since the scope of the project involves many different components, work 

        has taken place over several semesters, with different students rotating 

        through the project. This has been especially challenging since each new 

        group of students must conform to work that has already been done but 

        also want to develop their own creative identity.</p>

      <h1>Evolution of the Course</h1>

      <p class=normal>As the course evolves, so does the technology. This evolution 

        has created the desire for increasingly sophisticated higher-end technology 

        elements. The desire to include such elements in the Web site poses many 

        challenges. Building a searchable database of the collection, creating 

        and integrating QuickTime VR virtual tours, and designing and developing 

        streaming audio and video content for the site created the need for new 

        skills and new approaches. The technical skills necessary to develop dynamic 

        database tools, for example, are significantly greater than those needed 

        to create a traditional Web site, but this became a necessary skill for 

        the student developers to learn since a searchable database of the Bayou 

        Bend Collection was a primary goal of the site. Further, conceptualizing 

        how the database tools will function is very different from the much less 

        complex task of designing static Web pages, and this new set of skills 

        demands a greater understanding of information design and management, 

        as well as databases and Web servers. Additional time, patience, and effort 

        are needed to design, develop, and evaluate these new technological components 

        where a steeper learning curve is required compared with less demanding, 

        and more simple Web site construction. </p>

      <p class=normal>Like many art museums with a Web presence, Bayou Bend wanted 

        to highlight its collection of American decorative arts and paintings 

        with a search mechanism that was simple enough for any Web visitor to 

        use, but also powerful enough to conduct relatively complex searches. 

        Students in the course began with an electronic version (QuarkXpress ) 

        of a recently published catalog of the Bayou Bend Collection of American 

        decorative arts and paintings and were able to &quot;cut and paste&quot; 

        selected text into a database created with Microsoft Access. This led 

        to many lengthy discussions between museum staff and students about what 

        information to include and how to organize and label it so that visitors 

        to the site would be able to easily access that information. A decision 

        to use ColdFusion to create the search interface allows users to access 

        the information in a variety of ways unique to decorative arts, such as 

        by category, (e.g., furniture, textiles, glass, metals), style (Baroque, 

        Rococo, Neoclassical, etc.), and place of origin (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, 

        etc.). The students also developed ColdFusion templates to display the 

        information about the collection in a variety of ways, including the display 

        of a &quot;results&quot; page with thumbnail images, larger images, and 

        additional descriptive text. A similar search interface allows users to 

        access information about selected plants in the Bayou Bend gardens by 

        common name, Latin name, origin, plant category, keywords, or a combination 

        of fields.</p>

      <p class=normal>In addition, the development of a virtual tour of the rooms 

        also makes use of the database and ColdFusion templates. Panoramas of 

        the rooms, created using QuickTime Virtual Reality software, allow users 

        to zoom in on objects for a closer look as they pan 360-degree views of 

        rooms included in the &quot;real&quot; Bayou Bend tour. The rooms also 

        include a number of &quot;hot spots&quot; which when clicked on provide 

        the user more information about selected objects in the collection.</p>

      <p class=normal>Because the decorative arts encompass such familiar objects 

        -- chairs, tables, tableware, etc., many people do not realize the 

        vast scope of questions raised by scholarship in the field. Because objects 

        of the highest quality are frequently those that have been preserved over 

        the years, it is easy to associate the study of the decorative arts with 

        the life styles of the rich and powerful. But the decorative arts also 

        tell us about the lives, training, skills, and business practices of the 

        crafts persons who created these objects. The materials used, and the 

        forms to which they are adapted, also tell us about trade between countries 

        around the world, the stylistic influences that often mirror political 

        influences, and as new forms are introduced, the history of domestic life.</p>

      <p class=normal>The scholarly questions raised by these topics make research 

        in the decorative arts different from research in many other fields. For 

        this reason, the developers of the Bayou Bend Web site felt it was important 

        to include a research guide that would introduce Web visitors to the techniques 

        and resources of scholars in the decorative arts. The desire to include 

        such a guide, tailored for serious researchers, fit into the museum's 

        mission to disseminate a wide range of information about Bayou Bend and 

        its collection. Additionally, this also was a good fit from the standpoint 

        of the university, since many of the students involved in the project 

        are enrolled in doctoral programs, where the design and development of 

        intensive research inquiry is an essential component of their course of 

        study. This convergence of the museum's wish to provide a richness 

        of "deep" data about Bayou Bend and its place in the landscape of American 

        decorative arts and the core research base that underlies our graduate 

        school experience speaks directly to the mutual benefit that has been 

        gained by both the museum and the university. </p>

      <p class=normal>Evaluation of the Web site is another concern of the developers 

        and the museum staff. Several students who have worked on the site are 

        in the process of conducting doctoral research in which they are designing 

        evaluation plans for the site. One such study, which is being conducted 

        this spring, focuses on a formative evaluation of the design, content, 

        and educational value of the site as perceived by several populations 

        of potential Bayou Bend Web site users. The sample will include Bayou 

        Bend docents who may use the site as a self-training aid, K-12 teachers 

        who may integrate the site into their art and social studies curriculum, 

        and university students who may use the site for informational purposes 

        to write research papers for art or American history. The results of the 

        formative evaluation will provide feedback to developers that will help 

        them to identify deficiencies in the site and make necessary improvements. 

        Another study (also planned for this spring) focuses on the educational 

        effectiveness of a virtual tour of Bayou Bend. Test results from classes 

        of fifth grade students who take the &quot;actual&quot; tour of Bayou 

        Bend will be compared to those who take a &quot;virtual&quot; tour on 

        the Web. In addition to helping students fulfill doctoral degree requirements, 

        the results of these studies will help guide the future development of 

        the site.</p>

      <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>

      <p class=normal>With each successive semester, the evolution of the course 

        continues to provide new lessons about the collaborative process. The 

        nature of true collaboration requires that all parties involved share 

        more than a friendly cooperation with one another for their mutual benefit. 

        An effective collaboration requires a commitment by all parties to actively 

        participate and contribute both time and resources to the design and development 

        of the Web site, whether as subject matter experts or Web developers. 

        The depth of this commitment is often a challenge for course facilitators 

        in their efforts to make sure the site progresses each semester. For museum 

        personnel, work on the Web site is an extra, time-consuming chore in addition 

        to their other many responsibilities. And for some students, the commitment 

        is only to a passing grade in the course. Fortunately, the desire of museum 

        staff to develop an innovative Web site motivates them to continue to 

        make contributions to the site and to provide feedback to developers; 

        many students are motivated by the knowledge that they are creating a 

        useful resource for actual clients.</p>

      <p class=normal>The collaboration between the university and the MFAH has 

        been and continues to be an educational process for both the students 

        and the museum staff. In addition to new technologies, teamwork, and Web 

        design theory, student developers must learn about the content, a subject 

        matter with which most are unfamiliar. Many museum staff members, as newcomers 

        to the Web, must continue to learn about the numerous possibilities the 

        Web has to offer for expanding the educational mission of the museum beyond 

        its physical walls. It is here that student developers have a unique opportunity 

        to create new and innovative educational resources utilizing the already 

        existing content. Because the museum personnel often have less experience 

        with the Web, it is up to student developers to educate them about Web-based 

        resources by demonstrating working prototypes to help them understand 

        and envision the possibilities. Prototype demonstrations have proved very 

        beneficial in improving Web components as well as generating new ideas 

        for future development. Based on these prototypes, existing information 

        about Bayou Bend has been gathered and formatted so that the Web site 

        now provides information available nowhere else.</p>

      <p class=normal>In order to continue to advance the Web site, students must 

        necessarily build on the work of previous development teams since there 

        is not enough time to &quot;start from scratch&quot; each semester. Creative 

        design and development efforts can be realized with the development of 

        individual resources or Web site components. Due to time limitations, 

        students are encouraged to develop resources that can be completed during 

        the semester. In addition, students are required to fully document team 

        development efforts in order to aid future student developers, particularly 

        for components that cannot be completed during a single semester.</p>

      <h1>Introduction to "The Franz Mayer Project"</h1>

      <p class=normal>Based on the success of the Bayou Bend Web project, the 

        MFAH has proposed several additional ventures for consideration. Already, 

        student teams have begun working on "The Franz Mayer" project, a second 

        MFAH Web project related to a traveling exhibition that is coming to the 

        Houston museum. In the spring of 2002, the Museo Franz Mayer in Mexico 

        City is sending a traveling exhibition, <i>Splendors of Vice Regal Mexico: 

        Three Centuries of Treasures from the Museo Franz Mayer,</i> to three 

        cities in the United States. The exhibition will consist of 130 decorative 

        and fine arts that will present to American audiences the rich artistic 

        heritage of colonial Mexico as revealed by works produced during the vice 

        regal period, 1521-1829.</p>

      <p class=normal>The first stop of the exhibition will be the Museum of Fine 

        Arts, Houston. To prepare for the exhibit, students in the Project-Based 

        Web course have begun working with MFAH staff to design and develop a 

        Web site that will present information from the exhibit and include supplemental 

        educational materials. In addition to basic information about the exhibit, 

        the design team is focusing on presenting selections from the catalog, 

        creating materials for teachers and students, designing activities for 

        families, and producing streaming audio and video of guest speakers who 

        will be part of scholarly symposia about the exhibit. <u></u></p>

      <p class=normal>Plans call for the Franz Mayer exhibition Web site to be 

        developed in both English and Spanish, and the development team is considering 

        ways that both the Museo Franz Mayer and the MFAH can use the Web site 

        after the exhibition has been completed. The initial work has focused 

        on a comparison of Franz Mayer and Ima Hogg, the woman who amassed the 

        Bayou Bend Collection, since Miss Hogg and Franz Mayer generally were 

        collecting items at the same time, and from generally the same period. 

        (Interestingly, both collectors were born in 1882 and died in 1975.)</p>

      <p class=normal>High school art students from Houston and Mexico City will 

        be invited to participate in a cultural exchange program during the exhibition 

        period. The purpose of this project will be for students to study the 

        art and artists from the Franz Mayer collection and how they compare with 

        the works of European and Asian art over the last three centuries. Twelve 

        high school students, a group of six from Houston and a group of six from 

        Mexico City, will visit each other's cities and meet with artists 

        and educators to explore the diverse cultural influences and identities 

        of the two countries. The students will create their own works of art 

        that will be displayed as part of the Franz Mayer exhibition and the entire 

        process will be documented on the Web site.</p>

      <h1>The Next Generation of Museum-Web Collaborative Projects</h1>

      <p class=normal>Collaboration between the University of Houston and the 

        Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, has been a tremendously beneficial experience 

        for both institutions. It is hoped that the two institutions can continue 

        to expand the scope of the collaboration. On the University side, an effort 

        is being made to attract more students from other programs such as art, 

        art education, history, and social studies education and have them enroll 

        in the course. Adding these students to the collaborative groups will 

        most certainly increase the creative efforts of each team. One of the 

        most surprising and enjoyable effects of continuing to offer the Projects-Based 

        Web Design course has been that it has evolved from its original form, 

        as strictly a Web design course, to more of a cross-disciplinary exploration 

        in which a variety of students examine the history, geography, religion, 

        economics, politics, and other cultural influences associated with works 

        of art and artifacts. Admittedly, while American decorative arts is a 

        totally new topic area for most of the students in the course and it takes 

        some time and effort for them to understand the scope of the field, being 

        able to work with so much of the museum's rich and diverse content 

        has elevated the course to a more meaningful and fertile educational experience 

        for all involved--the students, the instructors and even the museum 

        staff. </p>

      <p class=normal>Efforts are also underway to move beyond the initial Bayou 

        Bend Collection and Gardens Web project. For example, it is hoped that 

        further collaboration with Bayou Bend will focus on a planned education 

        and visitor center with state-of-the-art instructional technology resources 

        and new projects for future student groups. Through the present collaboration, 

        Bayou Bend, a museum that studies nothing after 1870, has entered the 

        21st century. Ironically, Bayou Bend, which is unable to be seen from 

        the street in Houston, now has a valuable cyberspace presence.</p>

      <p class=normal>Discussions are also underway with MFAH staff on how this 

        Web development model can be extended to other projects such as the museum's 

        photography collection, the Art of the Americas, Oceania and Africa collection, 

        a Murals in the Park project, and more. Getting more museum staff to become 

        actively involved in the course is another goal. The success of the course 

        has been in part due to the commitment of course facilitators who work 

        closely with the student teams. Facilitators include students who took 

        the course earlier and who still have an interest in the project as well 

        as other faculty members who volunteer their time and efforts. Recruiting 

        additional museum staff members to serve as course facilitators and consultants 

        will add even more value to the course since they help articulate the 

        goals and objectives of the museum and provide insight and expertise related 

        to works of art and how they are exhibited. </p>

      <p class=normal>University and museum participants are searching for additional 

        funding opportunities, such as external grants, donations, corporate sponsorship, 

        etc., which will be used to expand the scope of the partnership into new 

        areas. An intriguing possibility is to create funded university/museum 

        doctoral fellowships that will attract doctoral students to work on these 

        projects. These students will work closely with museum personnel and university 

        faculty as they take responsibility for various project components, mentoring 

        other students, conducting dissertation research, publishing scholarly 

        articles about their work, and presenting their findings at national and 

        international conferences. As this collaborative partnership between the 

        MFAH and the University of Houston continues to evolve, it is expected 

        that new and even more interesting ideas will emerge.</p>
