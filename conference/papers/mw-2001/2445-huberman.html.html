      <p class=PaperTitle>Unseen Discussions: artist@hotmail.com</p>

      <p class=Author>Anthony Huberman P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, USA</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>For the recent exhibition Greater New York: New Art 

        in New York Now, the Education Department at P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center 

        organized a unique email-based discussion. The museum set up an e-mail 

        address for most participating artists using the free Hotmail.com service. 

        These addresses were displayed on P.S.1's website, where each artist had 

        his/her own Web-page, and on sheets available in the museum lobby; and 

        most importantly, the addresses were printed directly on to the wall labels 

        in the galleries. This established a platform where public and artist 

        could discuss the work and exchange ideas. The forum was easy, free, international, 

        immediate, private, and almost intimate. The museum relinquished its monopoly 

        over the interpretation of the art by opening up unmediated channels of 

        communication between artist and public. </p>

      <h1>P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center</h1>

      <p class=normal>P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center is a large museum located 

        in the Long Island City section of Queens, New York. Since 1971 under 

        the direction of Founding Director Alanna Heiss, P.S.1 has showcased the 

        work of thousands of local and international emerging artists and has 

        been a defining force in New York's cultural life. Housed in a 100-year 

        old school building, the museum organizes critically acclaimed solo and 

        group exhibitions year-round and a summer outdoor live DJ Series. Since 

        1997, P.S.1's renovated building has been the largest contemporary 

        art center in the world. The museum combines a world-class exhibition 

        program, a prestigious National and International Artist Studio Residency 

        Program, and a broad spectrum of education and public programs that serve 

        its many audiences. In early 2000, P.S.1 became an affiliate of The Museum 

        of Modern Art, New York, and looks forward to exploring the many possible 

        collaborations with MoMA over the next years.</p>

      <h2>The education program</h2>

      <p class=normal>Since 1985, P.S.1's Education Department has offered 

        its various audiences opportunities to get involved with the museum, the 

        exhibitions, and the artists. Continuing P.S.1's commitment towards 

        working closely with artists, the education program reflects a particularly 

        active effort to bring a wide public in contact with the emerging artist 

        community. Youth and family programs include art classes and art-making 

        workshops with artists included in P.S.1 exhibitions. School programs 

        include tours and art-making workshops with artists, collaborative on-line 

        project development with artists, and a Teen Curators Series. Adult programs 

        include panels and discussions bringing artists, writers, and curators 

        in contact with the public, a Writers Series showcasing texts by emerging 

        writers on pieces in the museum galleries, brochures and print materials 

        with artist statements and interviews, and interactive Web projects. </p>

      <h2>Greater New York</h2>

      <p class=normal>In February 2000, P.S.1 and MoMA presented the result of 

        their first curatorial collaboration. The exhibition <i>Greater New York: 

        New Art in New York Now</i> began as an open-call for submissions, and 

        several thousands portfolio submissions and hundreds of studio visits 

        later, became a massive building-wide show for which 30 P.S.1 and MoMA 

        curators brought together the work of over 140 New York-based artists 

        who have emerged as vital, creative voices in their fields over the past 

        five years. The exhibition turned out to be one of the most successful 

        shows in the history of P.S.1, drawing thousands of visitors and critical 

        acclaim. Hits to P.S.1's website, <a

href="http://www.ps1.org/" target="new">http://www.ps1.org</a>, tripled over the 

        course of the exhibition, as the museum hosted its most ambitious on-line 

        exhibition to date, now on view at <a href="http://www.ps1.org/cut/tours.html" target="new">http://www.ps1.org/cut/tours.html</a>. 

        The many components that made up the exhibition contributed to its unprecedented 

        success.</p>

      <h1>The E-Mail Project</h1>

      <p class=normal>One of the components initiated by the museum's Education 

        Department was dubbed the E-Mail Project. A month before the opening of 

        the exhibition, museum staff set up an e-mail address for each artist 

        using the free Hotmail.com service. To better distinguish the newly created 

        e-mail addresses, the following format was used: </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>lastname_greaterny@hotmail.com. </p>

      <p class=normal>After receiving a long explanation of what the project required 

        and the responsibilities that accompanied it, over 80 of the 146 artists 

        included in the Greater New York exhibition agreed to join. All artists 

        were shown how to use the service and how to access their private account. 

        As an important step to ensure the success of the project, the artists 

        were strongly warned that their participation required them to check the 

        account several times a week and to respond to all relevant messages. 

        Those not able to make that commitment were excluded from the project.</p>

      <p class=normal>Each artist was made aware that the dialogue that occurred 

        through the e-mails would not be screened by the museum and would be seen 

        by the artist alone. Different from a "chat room" or a "bulletin board," 

        the messages would not be posted on the museum website but would remain 

        in the private Hotmail inboxes of the recipient artist. Since no institutional 

        control was possible, all were warned of the possibility for "spam" or 

        other unwanted or unwelcome messages. Furthermore, since there was no 

        precedent for the project, the quantity and quality of the messages remained 

        completely unknown and impossible to predict. The museum was eager to 

        showcase selected messages on the P.S.1 Greater New York Website, and 

        artists were encouraged to forward particularly interesting messages to 

        the museum Website staff.</p>

      <p class=normal>The e-mail addresses were then displayed in three places:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><span class=normal> on P.S.1's Website, where each artist had his/her own personal Web 

          page</span></li>

        <li><span class=normal> on sheets available in the museum lobby for visitors to take away</span></li>

        <li><span class=normal> on the wall labels of the artists' works in the galleries</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=normal>Through the Website, a local and international audience 

        was able to contact the artists directly by sending them direct and private 

        e-mail messages. In the Greater New York site, each artist had his or 

        her personal Web page, complete with an image, an exhibition history, 

        a selected bibliography, an artist statement, and an e-mail address. When 

        and if they were forwarded to museum staff, excerpts from e-mail correspondence 

        were also posted in the artist's page, adding new insight to what 

        was an invaluable resource for information about significant up-and-coming 

        artists.</p>

      <p class=normal>Visitors to the museum could take home with them an "address 

        book" of e-mail addresses for the artists. One computer was placed in 

        the museum lobby, but was meant for browsing the Web site, not for sending 

        e-mails. Since e-mail correspondence requires users to log into a personal 

        home or office account, visitors could not use the computer on-site at 

        P.S.1 to correspond with the artists. Instead, museum-goers could take 

        home a free pamphlet with the complete lists of existing e-mail addresses 

        for Greater New York artists and compose a message at a more comfortable 

        time and place.</p>

      <p class=normal>Most importantly, visitors in the galleries, when consulting 

        the wall label for the usual name and title information, were confronted 

        with the possibility of communicating directly with the artists in the 

        exhibition. By simply adding a line to the standard museum wall label, 

        the presence of the E-Mail Project was carried from the digital world 

        of the Internet to the physical world of the galleries themselves, an 

        exercise which remains unusual for many web projects.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="huberman.fig1.jpg" width="232" height="147" alt="Table 1: A sample wall label from the exhibition, including an email address"></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Table 1: A sample wall label from the exhibition, including 

        an email address</p>

      <h1>Results</h1>

      <p class=normal>Several factors played a part in evaluating the results 

        of the project. First of all, since there exists no pre-existing model 

        with which to compare it, a comprehensive understanding of its successes 

        and short-comings is difficult. In addition, the very nature of the project, 

        and indeed one of its most significant and characteristic traits, was 

        that the messages were kept in private e-mail accounts, inaccessible to 

        museum staff. Any assessment was possible only by asking the participants 

        to discuss what they had received. </p>

      <p class=normal>Once the exhibition closed, Education staff did indeed interview 

        many of the artists in order to get an idea of the results. An important 

        question was that of identifying the different types of users. Feedback 

        from the artists revealed that e-mail messages could be divided into 5 

        roughly defined categories, here listed in no particular order:</p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class=normal>curators and gallery owners</span></li>

        <li> <span class=normal>collectors</span></li>

        <li><span class=normal>writers participating in the Greater New York Writing Project</span></span></li>

        <li><span class=normal>the "unidentified" general public</span></span></li>

        <li><span class=normal>teachers</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=normal><span>An obvious - but admittedly unanticipated - group 

        of e-mail corresponders were local and international curators and gallerists. 

        Partly due to its sheer size, to the involvement of The Museum of Modern 

        Art, to an aggressive publicity campaign, and naturally, to the quality 

        of the works, the exhibition received a significant amount of press in 

        national and international papers and art magazines. Many curators, from 

        New York galleries to prestigious institutions around the world, visited 

        the exhibition and the exhibition Web site. Many of them took advantage 

        of the E-Mail Project to contact artists and request additional information 

        about their work, images, CVs, or studio visits. Artists engaged in continuous 

        dialogue with curators and became involved in exhibitions in other spaces, 

        from Houston to Berlin, London and Tokyo. Important to keep in mind is 

        that many of the artists included in Greater New York were not yet represented 

        by a commercial gallery, and this direct and facilitated link to curators 

        proved very promising and helpful. A particularly potent example is that 

        of a young and unrepresented artist receiving a personal message of interest 

        from the Director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Arnold Lehman. Of course, 

        artists already working with commercial galleries referred the interested 

        curator to the appropriate person at the gallery to continue the correspondence. 

        E-mails from curators, in the case of some artists, made up more than 

        half of all messages received during the course of the show. This impressive 

        tally was certainly a welcome by-product of the E-Mail Project, especially 

        from the artists' point of view. Nevertheless, the project was conceptualized 

        by the P.S.1 Education team more as a tool for outreach and for encouraging 

        an open unmediated exchange of ideas and interpretations between a general 

        public and the artists rather than as a way to further careers. This particular 

        outcome of the project was not among the intended or sought-after goals, 

        yet it stands undeniably as a prominent one.</span></p>

      <p class="normal">Another frequent user of the e-mail addresses was the 

        art collector. Once again, this audience is one which the initiative did 

        not aim for, but was nevertheless significant. As with curators, artists 

        were only too pleased to receive messages from collectors. One young artist, 

        who had shown her work very little before her inclusion in Greater New 

        York - she is now frequently featured in exhibitions in many New York 

        galleries - was quite unprepared for the response from collectors, and 

        sold all of her pieces within the first few weeks. She then spent the 

        next many weeks telling collectors from across the country that all her 

        work had been sold and that she was working on new pieces (as fast as 

        she could, presumably). An issue that becomes immediately apparent is 

        that of artists selling their work without going through the gallery that 

        represents them. Of course, it is difficult to convince artists to divulge 

        details concerning the sales of their artworks, but the opportunity to 

        by-pass the gallery is one which surely crossed the mind of several.</p>

      <p class="normal">The Greater New York Writers Project was another initiative 

        of the Education Department and whose full description deserves a paper 

        in itself. To accompany the open-call for artist submissions, the museum 

        organized an open-call for writer submissions. Given the difficulty of 

        articulating a cohesive theme and a concise curatorial essay for a show 

        so heterogeneous in content, the exhibition catalogue was made up of texts 

        selected from the group of emerging writers from the Writers Project. 

        Approximately 100 texts were selected by a screening committee at P.S.1 

        and MoMA, giving the exhibition a broad scope of interpretation and insight. 

        Texts varied from the art-historical to the creative, as theoretical essays 

        appeared alongside more creative short stories or poems. The e-mail addresses 

        proved to be an invaluable resource for many writers. Artists received 

        messages filled with questions about their work, and later on, drafts 

        of essays-in-progress. Eager that the text be included in the catalogue, 

        artists responded to the questions generously and participated in what 

        could be called an e-mail interview. Following is the beginning of one 

        such response:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Dear Brian, thanks for writing. 

        I've had some contact through the P.S.1 e-mail address. Actually, 

        more than I thought and a few helpful things for the future. I will see 

        what I can fax to you. I will copy my bio and a review of one of my CDs. 

        The Wire article you can find through my label - JDK. If you do a search 

        on Radiantslab and JDK, you should be able to find the site. You can find 

        some articles reprinted there. Attached to this e-mail is the bio, etc. 

        If you can, also check out my small piece at Postmasters on W. 19th. Thanks 

        a lot.</span></p>

      <p class=normal>Given the artist's accessibility through the E-Mail 

        Project, several writers who would not have done so otherwise decided 

        to contribute a text. Indeed, many artists and writers, over e-mail of 

        course, arranged to meet in person to further discuss ideas for the essay. 

        Having the Greater New York e-mail addresses as resources for private 

        exchanges that guaranteed a personal, tailored response prompted many 

        young writers to move beyond the often paralyzing intimidation that is 

        so common among people uninitiated in, and unfamiliar with, the New York 

        art world.</p>

      <p class=normal><span>The last two segments of the E-Mail Project audience 

        were those that the project most aimed to reach. Most artists confirmed 

        that about a third of the messages they received were from a more general 

        public, unaffiliated with the professional art world. Art students, local 

        residents, tourists, and the simply curious found the opportunity to communicate 

        directly with the artist to be an unusual exercise in sharing thoughts, 

        impressions, opinions, and suggestions. For example, for a piece involving 

        a fully functional sauna in the museum's courtyard where visitors 

        were invited to disrobe and join in, responses varied from the simply 

        helpful:</span></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span>There is a good article on nudity in Austin at 

        <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/" target="new">www.austinchronicle.com</a> 

        that you might be interested in. </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span>to the more profuse:</span></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span>the next morning I woke up thinking about my experience 

        and how it was that you managed to coax total public nudity out of me 

        in such a short time. what was at play in your piece that made it so easy 

        for me? and for my girlfriend as well for that matter? And more importantly, 

        do those factors aproximate [sic] the culture of public bathing you described 

        in Finland? You see, to us, the fact that the curtain is slightly parted, 

        the changing room door does not actualy [sic] connect with the curtain, 

        the ability to see people outside from behing [sic] the door, the clear 

        plastic of the ventilation slot etc... all those elements created a kind 

        of kinkyness. they all played on the notion of voyeurism. it was all a 

        kind of game where the bather plays with how much or how little he is 

        willing to show. every time he moves, he has to consiously [sic] decide 

        to be descrete [sic](prudeish?) or not. Every time he notices an opportunity 

        for exposure he is confronted with either exitement [sic] or fear or a 

        realization of shame about that fear. It is therefore key to the experience 

        that it be a repetition of the same series of decisions. with each cycle, 

        the bather may become more daring (or less so). that daring evolves very 

        quickly over those forty five minutes because the bather has to make those 

        kinds of decisions so often. In any case, I would really appreciate it 

        if you could write me back and tell me a little bit about what role you 

        think sexuality plays is your piece. </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span>People seemed to be unusually frank and almost vulnerable 

        in their responses:</span></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span>Your video piece was very endearing. Well, that 

        makes it sound almost cuddly. It was also kind of frightening. There was 

        some suggestion of violence, to me. Maybe I associate circuses and carnivals 

        with mayhem.</span></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span>Do you consider this work to be a product of your 

        Colombian heritage, or is it strictly an illustration/embodiment of the 

        five physical dimensions?</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span>Straight-forward "fan letters" were also very common. 

        Instead of feeling the need to ask questions, people enjoyed being able 

        to simply express their enthusiasm for the piece. Artists read these letters 

        with great appreciation. Repeatedly, artists mentioned that these types 

        of letters are a missing component in the art world: rarely does an artist 

        receive a letter of praise from an unknown exhibition visitor. Most of 

        the time, feedback exists only in critical reviews in the press or through 

        friends. Indeed, many artists saved and treasured these short "fan e-mails." 

        Following is one of the favorite notes received by one of the artists. 

        It is written by a young student who visited the museum on a class trip:</span></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span>To Artist,</span></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span>I recently visited P.S. 1 with my school, I go 

        to The Ursuline School in New Rochelle. I choose your piece as my favorite. 

        I thought it was very creative and calming. I enjoyed the way the cotton 

        candy actually moved with the music. I also liked the split screen which 

        made it look like it was a mirror image. The music was soothing and watching 

        the cotton candy was amusing. I think your idea was very original and 

        creative. I didn't understand the music so i was happy that there was 

        a translation. Please write back. Thank you.<i></i></span></p>

      <p class=normal>In addition to their students, many teachers used the e-mail 

        address to get in touch with artists in order to better prepare lectures 

        or workshops for their classes. Several artists sent teachers ideas for 

        workshop projects or provided them with a more elaborate explanation of 

        their work. After a class visit to the museum, a teacher gave her students 

        an assignment to use the e-mails to contact an artist of their choice 

        and ask him or her a specific set of questions. Some artists were bombarded 

        with 20 messages from 8-year old children and patiently answered their 

        questions. One curious and courageous artist, taking advantage of the 

        anonymity of e-mail, actually attended the lecture of a college professor 

        who had been in touch with her about her work, simply to hear what the 

        lesson would discuss.</p>

      <p class=normal><span>Used to more ordinary and "safer" responses to artworks 

        that appear in Bulletin Boards or are heard at panel discussions and public 

        forums, the P.S.1 Education Department was pleased to see an exchange 

        of ideas that seemed less inhibited than in many other systems and strategies 

        for gathering audience feedback. </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span>A reporter for the online zine FEED, Claire Barliant, 

        independently interviewed several participating artists for an article. 

        Noting the absence of Web art in Greater New York, the reporter named 

        the E-Mail Project as the museum's stab at including the Internet 

        in the exhibition. Her conversations with artists suggested a mixed result, 

        some artists receiving a significant amount of correspondence, but others 

        voicing disappointment in the turnout. The article noted a particularly 

        intriguing occurrence, "prov[ing] the elasticity of the e-mail project" 

        (Barliant, 2000), where an artist not included in the exhibition nevertheless 

        created a <a href="mailto:greaterny@hotmail.com"><span>greaterny@hotmail.com</span></a> 

        account for himself. </span></p>

      <h1>Implications for Museum Outreach</h1>

      <p class=normal><span>The Greater New York E-Mail Project is an intelligent 

        and effective strategy for engaging an exhibition audience. Museums across 

        the world have tried many different methods and systems to foster a relationship 

        with their visitors, ranging from docent tours, art classes for children, 

        and museum-school partnerships to scholarly lectures and film screenings, 

        not to mention merchandise and brand names. Rarer, however, are attempts 

        to put the public, or rather, the publics, in direct contact with the 

        artists. This is a commitment that P.S.1 has always maintained.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span>The strongest aspect of the E-Mail Project is what 

        it stands for. The FEED magazine article mentioned above determined that 

        since artists did not receive an overwhelming amount of insightful and 

        intellectually provoking messages, the project as a whole failed in its 

        purpose as an effective forum for dialogue. On the contrary, the project 

        succeeded even before anyone put fingers to keyboard. Whether they were 

        consulting the wall label, visiting the website, or taking the e-mail 

        address book home, viewers of Greater New York were confronted with an 

        exhibition interested less in convincing its public of a specific curatorial 

        viewpoint or appreciation of art, than in providing a stimulus for others 

        to consider and interpret. By adding e-mail addresses into the exhibition, 

        Greater New York curators opened up important channels of personal and 

        private interpretation and evaluation.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span>Curators, and the museums that legitimize them, have 

        traditionally been the authors of "correct" and "incorrect" understanding 

        of art and gatekeepers of good and bad taste. Exhibitions have been vehicles 

        and frameworks through which curators and their museums tell their viewers 

        how to think about art. Little or no room is left for the visitor to develop, 

        much less articulate, his or her own meaning for the works. In recent 

        years, an increased interest on the part of museums and curators in seeking 

        the participation of the audience has spawned non-linear exhibition design 

        and layout, education and outreach programs, including bulletin boards 

        (both physical and digital), interactive website projects, and "meet the 

        artist" events, among other many examples. More and more, especially in 

        contemporary art museums, the visitor's input is sought after and 

        legitimized. This trend is fueled by the belief that leaving space for 

        public participation makes the museum less of an intimidating fortress 

        for the elite and more of an appealing and accessible center for shared 

        ideas.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span>The E-Mail Project functions with similar goals and 

        post-modern theoretical roots but brings new energy to an overly-saturated 

        world of museum outreach initiatives. The project's simplicity is 

        deceiving: the mere appearance of the e-mail address on the wall label, 

        on the website, or in the lobby has the symbolic effect of encouraging 

        discussion and debate. Viewer opinions and impressions are suddenly acknowledged 

        and legitimized before any such opinion or impression has even been written 

        down. The negotiations around the content of the exhibition are removed 

        from the hands of the curator alone and extended to include anyone interested 

        in joining. The project provides visitors with an open channel for the 

        pursuit and development of their own personal interpretations and associations. 

        Indeed, the personal e-mail addresses were communication tools as much 

        as they were symbols for a democratization of the understanding of art. 

        In effect, the simple act of displaying the artist's availability 

        to discuss the work, unsupervised by museum staff - in the shape of an 

        e-mail address - points to the willingness on the part of the curators 

        to relinquish their monopoly over a "correct" interpretation of the artworks. 

        </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span>Setting this project apart from other systems of audience 

        outreach is its invisibility. E-mail correspondence provides both sender 

        and recipient with a private, immediate and almost intimate medium of 

        communication. Being part of over 140 included in the exhibition, many 

        artists welcomed the intimacy the e-mails brought to their experience 

        as participants in Greater New York. In a show of its scale, one-on-one 

        communication and channels for feedback are difficult to establish, and 

        the exchange of private e-mails provided a way for artists and audience 

        to maintain a relationship with the show. As already noted, privacy helped 

        audience members feel more comfortable about communicating with the artists. 

        As is often the case in public forums and panel discussions, visitors 

        can find it intimidating to voice their opinions, questions, or personal 

        associations and interpretations, a difficulty easily overcome by the 

        unmediated nature of e-mail messages. Especially important was the assurance 

        that their comment would be heard and responded to. In the more public 

        bulletin boards or feedback notebooks common in many museums, viewer contributions 

        are rarely, if ever, answered or acknowledged. In this case, the corresponder 

        had the luxury of a specific listener and could look forward to a reaction 

        to an opinion or an answer to a question. This aspect of the project heavily 

        contributed to the volume of messages sent and helped the museum position 

        itself as the host for a tailored and careful platform for meaningful 

        exchange. As many pedagogues have stated, education works best if it occurs 

        through dialogue rather than monologue. Indeed, the E-Mail Project transformed 

        the museum experience from monologue to dialogue: from quietly absorbing 

        a curatorial stance (in public) to actively negotiating the importance 

        and meaning of the works (in private). It seems as if museums can use 

        the Internet, or more specifically, e-mail, as an appropriate "tool for 

        the task." Interestingly, museum education can be left as a private experience. 

        </span></p>

      <p class=normal>Other significant traits of the project are its cost-efficiency, 

        its international reach, and its role in the actual gallery display of 

        the exhibition. First, the E-Mail Project was completely free of cost. 

        The museum could set up e-mail accounts on the free Hotmail.com service, 

        after which the project was left in the hands of the public and of the 

        artists. During the private exchange of messages, museum staff members 

        were not involved in screening, editing, or maintaining the correspondence 

        and could let it run its course. Second, by including the addresses on 

        the museum Web site, the project was international in scope. Initiated 

        by a comprehensive site which included images, bios, analytical and creative 

        essays, and streaming sound and video, web-surfers from around the world 

        sent artists their impressions and questions. Many artists noted that 

        the wide reach of the website led to an exciting variety of opinions and 

        remarks. While some artists received invitations to participate in exhibitions 

        abroad, others heard from people with surprising reactions, sometimes 

        written in a foreign language. This characteristic also suggests that 

        one could set up a similar project for an exhibition in any location. 

        Being in New York certainly helped keep attendance figures high, but an 

        e-mail based dialogue could be an effective and successful component to 

        exhibitions in any city in the world.</p>

      <p class=normal><span>As briefly mentioned above, a final aspect rich in 

        implications is the role played by the project in the galleries themselves. 

        Including the addresses on the wall labels on one hand disrupted, or rather, 

        redefined a traditional relationship between artwork and its viewer, and 

        secondly, fully integrated the Internet as a central component in the 

        exhibition. As one artist emphasized, the insertion of the e-mail address 

        on the wall label adds new life to a long-standing standard in the techniques 

        of museum display. A document which usually contains nothing more than 

        factual information suddenly gains a certain open-endedness that can powerfully 

        alter the viewer's experience with the work of art itself. Furthermore, 

        the introduction of the universally understood "@" sign into the gallery 

        space highlights the role played by the Internet in the physical experience 

        of the works. No longer a marginal subsidiary to the physical display 

        of the show in the form of an online-only project, the Internet is woven 

        into the fabric of the exhibition itself. In addition to the e-mail addresses, 

        selected texts from the Writers Project, all submitted to the screening 

        committee over e-mail, were on view in the galleries. Interestingly, in 

        her article for FEED magazine, Claire Barliant, noting that Greater New 

        York did not include any artists who use the Web as their chosen medium, 

        names the E-Mail Project as the Net.art segment of the exhibition (Barliant, 

        2000). </span></p>

      <h1>Limitations</h1>

      <p class=normal>Far from flawless, the project gained from its first incarnation 

        several insights as to its limitations and possible improvements. A first 

        limitation is that it may only be possible with relatively emerging artists. 

        Since its success depends on the reliability of the artists to check 

        their e-mail accounts and to respond to any mail, it is difficult to expect 

        that world-renowned artists would be willing to invest the time and energy 

        necessary. Immediately following Greater New York, P.S.1 presented Around 

        1984: A Look at Art in the Eighties, with artists such as Peter Halley, 

        Jenny Holzer, Julian Schnabel, Sophie Calle, and Anish Kapoor, among others. 

        With very busy schedules and near-celebrity status, these artists would 

        surely not have agreed to maintain an e-mail address. Artists in the beginning 

        of their career, on the other hand, are more likely to take on the responsibility 

        of corresponding with the general public over e-mail on an on-going basis.</p>

      <p class=normal><span>Another problem lay in the quality and quantity of 

        the e-mail messages themselves. For example, many artists complained of 

        "spam" mail. Artists received dozens of messages from various mailing 

        lists. Some artists took advantage of the network of e-mail addresses 

        to publicize shows of which they were part, and many exhibition announcements 

        were sent out. This problem is one that plagues all e-mail users and seems 

        to be an unfortunate by-product, and one difficult to avoid, of the technology. 

        Also, some artists received significantly more mail than others. With 

        a show of its scale, it was impossible to guarantee that each artist would 

        get an equal number of messages. Perhaps a smaller exhibition would lead 

        to a more equal distribution of correspondence. Additional publicity might 

        also have been helpful. Had the E-Mail Project been announced more formally 

        on the exhibition print materials (press release, brochure, postcards), 

        or even better, had it profited from its own press release or announcement 

        card, it might have attracted more users. Again, the existence of the 

        project was visible on the wall labels, on the Web site, and as a take-away 

        pamphlet in the lobby, and not in any mailed or otherwise distributed 

        materials. </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span>One last suggested improvement is to stress the importance 

        to artists of forwarding excerpts of particularly interesting messages 

        to the museum staff, for Web posting. With artists acting as gatekeepers, 

        the project could have profited from a larger amount of excerpted correspondences 

        being made public. Not only would these short texts highlight the dynamic 

        interaction going on behind the closed doors of the Hotmail addresses, 

        but they also would act as a bulletin board moderated by the artists, 

        and surely prompt more people to respond and react to the postings by 

        sending messages of their own. </span></p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class=normal><span>Greater New York and its use of the Internet and e-mail 

        was an exciting and unique experience for all involved: museum staff, 

        artists, and audiences. Emphasizing a space for an open, free, and private 

        interpretation of the works on view, yielding unintended but beneficial 

        results such as exhibition and sale opportunities for artists, reaching 

        audiences of all ages and nationalities, and bringing new media to the 

        forefront of museum outreach techniques, the E-Mail Project combined the 

        complexities of the museum experience with the enthusiasms of the museum 

        audience to create a one-of-a-kind synthesis of art and communication. 

        It is surely a strategy that deserves the attention and consideration 

        of education, curatorial, and new media museum professionals.</span></p>
