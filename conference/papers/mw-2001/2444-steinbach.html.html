      <p class=PaperTitle>Using Interactive Broadband Multicasting in a Museum 

        Lifelong Learning Program</p>

      <p class=Author>Leonard Steinbach, The Cleveland Museum of Art, USA</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The Cleveland Museum of Art has embarked on an innovative 

        approach for delivering high quality video-on-demand and live interactive 

        cultural programming, along with Web-based complementary material, to 

        seniors in assisted living residence facilities, community-based centers, 

        and disabled persons in their homes. The project is made possible in part 

        by a grant from the Technology Opportunity Program [TOP], National Telecommunications 

        and Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce totaling more 

        than $500,000. The purpose of the grant is to demonstrate how emerging 

        broadband telecommunications technology can deliver &quot;lifelong learning 

        and the arts&quot; to populations for whom direct involvement with cultural 

        institutions would otherwise not be possible.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText><span> </span>The approach uses Cisco IP/TV interactive 

        video archive/broadcast servers and broadband multicast technology in 

        a controlled public infrastructure environment, rather than the closed 

        corporate or campus network environment for which it was designed. In 

        addition to describing the program design and operation, this paper analyzes 

        how this Museum, whose core competency is not, nor should be, advanced 

        technology development and management, mustered the expertise to achieve 

        technological innovation in pursuit of programmatic goals. It also focuses 

        on the process of convening outside individuals, organizations, and expertise 

        to complement each other to achieve a common goal. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class=Normal>Be forewarned! You are about to read a tale of great technological, 

        social, and educational aspiration. Of community groups, corporate interests 

        and federal funding. Of populations isolated and impaired. Of external 

        evaluation and intradepartmental coordination. It is a work in progress 

        about which the known facts are provided and our hopes for the future 

        are unveiled. </p>

      <p class=Normal>This paper presents an innovative approach for using broadband 

        multicast technology to deliver high quality video-on-demand and live 

        interactive cultural programming, complemented by Web-based resources, 

        to seniors in assisted-living residence facilities, community-based centers, 

        and disabled persons in their homes. But that is a rather cold description. 

        We want to change people's lives through continuing lifelong learning 

        and the arts and interaction with each other. We strive for no less than 

        arousal of the spirit, though we will define our goals a bit less spiritedly 

        later on. The technology we have chosen comprises the best tools we could 

        find at this time, ones we believe harbinger the future. The combination 

        of technology, program and process form an experiment which has been funded. 

        No doubt the details of technology will change dramatically over time, 

        but we hope that the process and program model we are presenting will 

        survive, evolve and prove useful to others. </p>

      <h1>Background</h1>

      <p class=Normal>To understand the genesis of the program, it is important 

        to understand its host's core values and experience. The Cleveland 

        Museum of Art, established in 1916, is one of the finest encyclopedic 

        art museums in the United States and is an integral part of Cleveland's 

        cultural and civic identity. As an institution established &quot;for the 

        benefit of all the people forever," the Museum welcomes close to 600,000 

        visitors each year. The Museum also has a long history of extensive public 

        programming in film, music, and dance as well as art-related classes, 

        lectures and family programs. In addition, the Museum has strong relationships 

        with the community and community groups through a range of outreach programs 

        and community festivals as well as its teachers school services, and adult 

        continuing education programs. Most recently, in 1998, the Museum became 

        a content provider and remote site for the Ohio SchoolNet Program. Ohio 

        SchoolNet provides live interactive distance learning programs for students 

        in grades K-12 throughout the state (<a href="http://www.osn.state.oh.us/" target="new">http://www.osn.state.oh.us</a>). 

        This is all no quirk of fate. The Board of Trustees had long established 

        the Museum's strategic goal of creating &quot;rich and diverse educational 

        and public programs that serve and engage many different audiences and 

        communities in an innovative and dynamic fashion.&quot;</p>

      <p class=Normal>In addition to its education context, the emerging role 

        of technology within all areas of the Museum was recognized by the Board. 

        This resulted in another important strategic goal: "to become a national 

        leader in the use of new and emerging technologies to enhance the value 

        to society of the museum's collections, intellectual initiatives, and 

        other activities.&quot; To accelerate progress in this area, in 1999 the 

        Museum established a new Information Technology Division (I.T.), headed 

        by a Chief Information Officer (CIO) on peer level with other senior management 

        and reporting to the Museum director. The new CIO (the author) immediately 

        established a guiding doctrine for technological leadership and adventurism: 

        "The core competency of a museum is not the mastery of diverse, complex 

        technologies... it is the creative use of them." There is no contradiction 

        here. It is quite possible for a Museum to achieve its techno-dreams without 

        insisting that it find the capital and human resources necessary to become 

        the be-all end-all of complex technology knowledge and management. This 

        principle will be echoed throughout this project plan.</p>

      <p class=Normal>This backdrop is important. Without a history of community 

        involvement, strong educational programs, and a dedication to the use 

        of new and evolving technologies, it is unlikely that the Museum would 

        ever have conceived of this project nor received the funding and other 

        support needed to make it happen.</p>

      <h1>(Technology) Opportunity (Program) Knocks</h1>

      <p class=Normal>In the fall of 1999, the Museum became aware of the availability 

        of funds for 2000 from the <a name="_Hlt498863789">Technology Opportunities 

        Program (TOP</a>) of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration 

        of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Since 1994, this has been a highly 

        competitive, merit-based federal grant program that brings the benefits 

        of an advanced national information infrastructure to communities throughout 

        the United States (<a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/otiahome/top" target="new">http://www.ntia.doc.gov/otiahome/top</a>). 

        The focus of its funding may vary from year to year, but for FY2000 the 

        intent could not have been more congruent with the Museum's interests. 

        TOP was "especially interested in projects...using advanced network 

        technologies...for example, broadband networks... to deliver immense 

        amounts of data quickly to the desktop." In addition, the notice identified 

        "Lifelong Learning and the Arts" as an area of interest, particularly 

        "training and instruction to lifelong learners in non-traditional settings 

        such as homes (and) community centers." With this scope defined, we proceeded 

        to explore whether there was a program the Museum would want to develop 

        which would further its goals. However, it is not our nature to contort 

        our goals in order to "follow the money."</p>

      <h1>Lurching Toward the Bait</h1>

      <p class=Normal>As would be expected, there was significant brainstorming 

        within the Museum, including staff and leaders from Information Technology, 

        Development, Education, Curatorial, and Community Outreach. We had many 

        answers and ideas, but finally realized that the truth lay not in ourselves 

        but in our stars... our friends and colleagues in the community. We 

        held a technology/program brainstorming party. Colleagues from SchoolNet, 

        from schools, and from nearby cultural organizations converged. Representatives 

        of Community groups aggregated. Technology companies whose help might 

        be needed in specification and installation were there to keep our feet 

        nailed to the ground. (Luckily, we still could reach for the sky.) Curious 

        curators convened. The public TV station was tuned in and got turned on. 

        You could not have too many cooks in this kitchen. After two hours of 

        guided discussion a general consensus seemed to evolve. We would focus 

        on isolated older persons in residential facilities or those who frequented 

        community centers, and, if possible, disabled persons who primarily spend 

        their time at home. We would provide both programming on demand and live 

        interactive programs where they live or congregate. It felt right and 

        meshed with Museum goals. However, more precise goals and next steps would 

        have to be defined.</p>

      <p class=Normal>Before addressing those issues, it is noteworthy that this 

        meeting, born of prior excellent relationships within the community, generated 

        more than a concept. Our guests informed our thought process, and we made 

        it clear that we were in this together. This setting of stage would prove 

        invaluable as the project moved forward.</p>

      <p class=Normal>At this point, the project develop<span class="Normal">ment 

        process still had to answer several critical questions:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">What did we hope to achieve?</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Was there available technology which would let 

          us demonstrate the conceived program at feasible cost and effort?</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Would residential facilities and community-based 

          organizations commit to participating in this program?</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Where would we get the content, both live and 

          archived, for this project?</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">How could the Museum inaugurate this level of 

          technology without diverting resources, or violating the precept of 

          creatively using technologies without investing an inappropriate amount 

          of time and effort in them?</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>Proof of Concept/Definition of Goal</h1>

      <p class=Normal>Intuitively, it seemed reasonable to expect that older and 

        impaired persons might benefit from interaction with cultural activities, 

        but we needed to confirm our hunch. With the assistance of Malvin Schechter, 

        a noted journalist, gerontologist, and consultant on issues of population 

        and aging, important research findings were brought to our attention. 

        Gerontological research seemed to assert that programs in the arts stimulate 

        cognitive functions, enhance daily life experience, and trigger memories 

        and creativity in older Americans. Research confirmed that being part 

        of a social network and diminishing isolation and loneliness have significant 

        impacts on health and longevity (Rowe &amp; Kahn, 1997; Fees &amp; Martin, 

        1999) . One study concluded that "interactive computing technology opens 

        up access to levels of communication and personal control that impact 

        directly on the quality of life for 'confined' individuals. 

        Indeed, the term 'confined' loses much of its meaning when the 

        world is at one's fingertips" (McConatha, McConatha &amp; Dermigny, 

        1994). </p>

      <p class=Normal>The Museum also had its own experience in this area. For 

        example, the museum has worked with the Cuyahoga County Board of Mental 

        Retardation and its constituents for about three years in a studio art 

        program.. Work with this population has already resulted in dramatic changes 

        in participants' lives. The simple artistic freedoms like choice 

        of colors or how to position the paper have increased confidence in participants 

        who have since attempted other personal achievements. Participants in 

        this program are now showing their artworks in community exhibitions. 

        One individual learned to climb stairs for the first time at the museum, 

        while another spoke his name for the first time in his life.</p>

      <p class=Normal>We knew enough to know we were on the right track. Our program 

        goal was then articulated as follows:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>To enrich the lives of seniors and disabled adults through 

        excellent arts programming delivered to them where they live and congregate 

        via broadband technology. Arts-related programs will be delivered to participants 

        at three types of sites: assisted living residence facilities, community-based 

        centers, and private homes. Older as well as physically and emotionally 

        disabled adults will benefit from relevant and rewarding exchanges wit<span class="Normal">h 

        cultural institutions through the new technologies proposed herein by 

        making it possible for them, for the first time, to participate in a broad 

        range of excellent programs from which they have been historically isolated.</span></p>

      <p class=Normal><span class="Normal"> Specifically, we would:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Develop an art program that provides a mechanism 

          for intellectually stimulating older adult learners;</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Develop an interactive, art-based program that 

          facilitates social engagement among older adult learners;</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Develop a delivery medium which can reduce the 

          social isolation often associated with living in senior care facilities; 

          and</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Develop a replicable model that can be used 

          by other cultural organization seeking to deliver comparable content 

          to similar populations via broadband technologies.</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=Normal><span class="Normal">Most important, our program would explore 

        and demonstrate how le</span>arning makes more meaningful the lives of 

        older persons or disabled persons for whom a visit to the conventional 

        museum and cultural institutions and activities would be difficult, inconvenient 

        or impossible. We would hope to learn how these extramural programs might 

        stimulate such audiences to inquire and learn in satisfying ways. Additionally, 

        we would develop a model and experience base that, by the nature of content 

        and technology, is replicable throughout the country, especially as this 

        technology becomes increasingly available.</p>

      <h1>The Future is Now: Selecting the Technology</h1>

      <p class=Normal>The technological vision for the project now had to emerge 

        alongside the more programmatic and content-oriented goals. The vision 

        was to establish a multi-point "distance learning-like" environment with 

        some level of interactivity, one which would include archived material, 

        additional Web-like content and Web access. The technology should be more 

        open, less complex and less expensive than traditional video teleconferencing. 

        After all, this is the way Internet is going: more, richer content and 

        greater interactivity through affordable access to a high-speed public 

        infrastructure. Even if it is not there yet, our charge was to be innovative 

        in our use of broadband technology and demonstrate what the future may 

        be.</p>

      <p class=Normal>This presented three technical issues: how to capture, digitize, 

        and compress video; how to develop and manage a video archive which can 

        provide video on demand on line; and, how to achieve an infrastructure 

        for getting the content from the source to the client.</p>

      <p class=Normal>A special work group was established to discover what existing 

        technology might be right for us. This small group initially included 

        Museum I.T. staff and a consultant from Keane, Inc., a major national 

        I.T. consulting firm which was engaged in another Museum project. He agreed 

        to contribute the assistance. </p>

      <p class=Normal>Some prospects were easy to rule out. Although we considered 

        cobbling a variety of products and technologies together to accomplish 

        our goal, we knew this would conflict with our "core competency doctrine" 

        and hobble our chance for success. The best opportunity for Museum support 

        and a successful implementation would be as close to a turnkey solution 

        as possible. Environments such as those available from Real Networks or 

        Microsoft NetMeeting and others were immediately ruled out. The nature 

        of both content and clients would demand close to full screen video of 

        near television quality. We wanted our clients to have warm, seemingly 

        familiar experiences with both our technology and our content. After all, 

        the program was not targeted toward highly self-motivated Internet users 

        who would put up with quarter-screen jitters. Our content should be the 

        reason for participating, and our technology should not get in the way.</p>

      <p class=Normal>We knew that we would require high-speed connections to 

        our clients. We also realized that we were looking for an IP multicast 

        solution, particularly for our live broadcasts. We decided that the increasing 

        availability of ADSL (henceforth, DSL), with its emphasis on downstream 

        speed, would be a feasible enabler (Craioveanu, 2000). We did not consider 

        Internet access services through cable-TV providers, since this was not 

        available in our area.</p>

      <p class=Normal>IP multicasting is defined as an "efficient means of transmitting 

        of a single large stream of data to a group of selected users at the same 

        time on a TCP/IP network such as the Internet" (<a href="http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia" target="new">http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia</a>). 

        It is also fundamental to the evolution of the Internet as demand increases 

        for better quality transmission of video and audio, and as transmissions 

        become targeted toward groups rather than broadcast to all. IP multicast 

        protocols have been under development since the early 1990's. Thus 

        far they have been used primarily in corporate and academic environments 

        where network traffic can be carefully engineered and monitored. We were 

        aware of some public initiatives in this area, such as Mbone, since 1996 

        a cooperative and voluntary experimental virtual network within the Internet. 

        This has been succeeded by other "bones," including 6bone and Qbone, and 

        protocols, like the Internet itself, continue to evolve. But there is 

        no current standard (Wirbel, 2000). </p>

      <p class=Normal>In addition to the protocol issues, IP multicast also requires 

        a telecommunications infrastructure which is "multicast enabled." That 

        is, it is comprised of routers and cabling which can handle the traffic 

        demanded by rich media and which can also filter signals to allow clients 

        to selectively receive transmission with a quality of service that would 

        make the product palatable. (This is somewhat simplified, but sufficient 

        for this purpose.) The current acceleration of commercial interest in 

        IP Multicast is clearly evidenced by the IP Multicast Initiative, "a world-wide, 

        multi-vendor forum accelerating the adoption of IP Multicast stimulating 

        demand of IP Multicast products and related services" and significant 

        source for articles, white papers, and conference information (<a href="http://www.ipmulticast.com/" target="new">http://www.ipmulticast.com</a>). 

        More than fifty companies now participate in this forum, including Cisco 

        Systems, Real Networks, Yahoo Broadcast, and Lucent Technologies. There 

        are even a number of national conferences each year focusing on this area. 

        Although there may be some complex and costly workarounds, the public 

        infrastructure was not ready yet for broadband IP multicast, even though 

        we were. </p>

      <h1>Welcome to the Turnkey Multicasting System</h1>

      <p class=Normal>Our product review brought us to Cisco Systems, Inc.'s 

        IP/TV system. Cisco's IP/TV was chosen over other prospective solutions 

        because it provides a more comprehensive set of features, in an end-to-end 

        turnkey solution, than any other solution we could find (<a href="http://www.cisco.com/" target="new">http://www.cisco.com</a>). 

        It comprises video capture with a choice of compression techniques, real-time 

        broadcasting capability, video archiving, an Internet-based interface, 

        and full router support at all points. As a tool designed for education 

        and training applications within an academic or corporate environment, 

        other features, including an interactive question manager and usage monitoring 

        tools, would also add value. A true broadband multicast solution (when 

        used within a network infrastucture supporting these features), IP/TV 

        can provide very high quality full- or near full-screen video, something 

        we had identified as a requirement. We also decided that the implementation 

        of a turnkey solution by a single well-known vendor had the added advantage 

        of one-stop training and support. If our program model of content delivery 

        proved successful, new and more feature-rich products could simply replace 

        the elements we had chosen. Finally, because we would use Cisco routers, 

        Cisco could be held responsible for the system's performance truly 

        end-to-end. This initial assessment was followed by a product demonstration 

        and tutorial for our technology team at Cisco's Cleveland office, 

        and additional telephone conferences with Cisco's IP/TV specialists. 

        The agreement that our local Cisco sales and technical reps would join 

        our technology team as needed, and that the regional office would provide 

        training and technical assistance to help assure project success, clinched 

        the decision.</p>

      <p class=Normal>The decision was later bolstered by an informative case 

        descrip<span class="Normal">tion of an IP/TV project at the Virginia Community 

        College System (<a href="http://www.so.cc.va.us/vccsit/IPTVproj.htm" target="new">http://www.so.cc.va.us/vccsit/IPTVproj.htm</a>).</span></p>

      <p class=Normal><span class="Normal">The planned configuration of the Cisco 

        IP/TV system comprises the following components:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal"><i>IP/TV 3411 Control Server </i>which centrally 

          manages the entire IP/TV system. The Control Server communicates instructions, 

          such as scheduling information, available video types, and bandwidth 

          considerations to IP/TV Broadcast and Archive Servers, along with program 

          information, to the IP/TV Viewer client software at the workstation. 

          Its interface allows system administrators to manage content, servers, 

          and bandwidth, and schedule broadcasts. It also balances network video 

          loads and optimizes network performance automatically. This server can 

          be fully controlled remotely from any, even low speed, IP-connected 

          terminal.</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal"><i>IP/TV 3422/3423 Broadcast Servers </i>capture 

          and digitize, store, and transmit programs according to directions received 

          from the Cisco 3411 Control Server. They are primarily used for multicasting 

          live or prerecorded programs from devices such as video cameras, VCRs, 

          DVDs, satellite, or cable feeds, or from prerecorded Windows Media, 

          AVI, MP3, and MPEG files. The Server must be located physically near 

          the source devices, such as cameras, mixers, etc., to which they directly 

          connect. The model differences pertain to the servers' digitization 

          format capabilities. </span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal"><i>IP/TV 3431 Archive Server </i>provides large-volume 

          storage capacity for Video on Demand (VoD). It enables the appropriate 

          stored video programs to be delivered at the right time, to the right 

          audience, whether streaming prerecorded video on a scheduled basis or 

          responding to a singular request. This server can be fully controlled 

          remotely from any, even low speed, IP-connected terminal. </span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal"><i>IP/TV Viewer </i>is<i> </i>the IP/TV system 

          client-side software, which communicates with the IP/TV 3411 Control 

          Server to get information about all available programs and display a 

          program listing. It allows participants to select and display programs, 

          ask to receive a scheduled program, or choose to display a program on 

          demand. (It informs the Control Server of what content is desired, and 

          the control server then directs the content delivery from the Broadcast 

          or Archive servers.) The Viewer can list both available IP/TV format 

          and Windows Media programs and offers VCR-like controls, key word searches 

          and program pre-scheduling. [Although IP/TV content could also be accessed 

          via an html web page and Windows Media Player, this client is required 

          in order to receive archived content stored in Cisco's proprietary 

          RTP format (sort of an encapsulated MPEG-4). We will require the Viewer 

          on all client stations in order to benefit from RTP's high quality 

          video compared with the bandwidth needed to receive it]. </span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=Normal>The configuration of the equipment is described later and 

        portrayed in Figure 1.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><a href="steinbachfig1.html"><img src="steinbach_fig1_400.jpg" width="381" height="285" border="0" alt="igure 1: IP/TV Broadband Multicast Distribution Network"></a><a name="fig1"></a></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1: IP/TV Broadband Multicast Distribution Network</p>

      <p class=Normal>Supplemental Cisco software which should p<span class="Normal">rove 

        effective for providing, managing, and monitoring content development 

        and delivery include:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Web Presenter, which allows the opening of a 

          video window and Web-based slides concurrently. </span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Web Plug-in, which allows a participant to watch 

          an IP/TV program embedded directly in a Web page.</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Question Manager, which provides a participants 

          interactivity by letting participants type in questions on line. A moderator 

          or instructor either answers the questions in real time or archives 

          them for follow-up. </span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Web Info, which allows participants, while watching 

          a program, to click a button and travel to a predefined URL location, 

          typically a Web page, containing additional program information.</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">SlideCast, which permits participants to simultaneously 

          see the presenter's PC-generated presentation materials in one window 

          and the presenter in the other, as if they were in the same room. </span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">StreamWatch, which gathers participant demographics 

          such as number of participating stations, identities, and viewing times 

          for pre scheduled programs, and for on-demand programs logs information 

          about which programs participants are watching and when.</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>Ticket to Ride</h1>

      <p class=Normal>Having tentatively selected the product suite that should 

        meet the video capture, storage, management and distribution requirements 

        of the project, the network infrastructure on which this would ride had 

        to be identified. As noted earlier, the public Internet is anything but 

        ready for broadband multicast prime time. We enlisted the assistance of 

        a local major ISP who recognized the benefits of early involvement with 

        broadcast multiband. Their assistance was also encouraged by their ongoing 

        relationship with the local Cisco office, not to mention the prestige 

        and good will associated with assisting the Museum. This A-Team team, 

        now comprised of <span class="Normal">representatives of Keane, Inc. (consulting), 

        APKnet (ISP), Cisco Systems, Inc., and Museum technical staff, along with 

        any additional ad hoc experts we could think of to call or e-mail, set 

        to task. I love it when a plan comes together (Smith, 1983)... and 

        it did:</span></p>

      <p class=Normal><span class="Normal">The network infrastructure would work 

        as follows:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">As a DSL reseller through local telephone providers 

          with direct lines to their central offices, the ISP would create private 

          virtual circuits between themselves and our clients (ISP-to-TelcoPoP-to-client])</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">The DSL client lines at the ISP could be then 

          be connected to a single high speed, broadband, multiprotocol, multimedia 

          router (Cisco 7206VXR) with a highly secure, specially configured gateway 

          connecting it to the public Internet.</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">The IP/TV Control and Archive servers would 

          be co-located at the ISP and connected directly to the high speed router 

          to assure the fastest and most direct service delivery. Demanded video 

          would travel directly from the ISP to the client via the virtual private 

          circuit. The servers could be operated remotely from any site with an 

          authorized IP connection, yet benefit from the power management and 

          physical security inherent in a ISP facility.</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Live broadcasts would be compressed and fed 

          by Broadcast servers "on location" to the Control servers at the ISP 

          via dedicated T-1's terminated at the same high speed router; similarly, 

          video-on-demand archival material could be loaded onto the archive/media 

          servers at the ISP using the same Broadcast servers via the same T-1's.</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Client locations would require multicast enabled 

          routers (Cisco 1720) in addition to the DSL modems specified by the 

          provider of the DSL loop.</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=Normal><span class="Normal">This configuration establishes a fundamentally 

        closed system. The ISP, wh</span>ich acts as the hub, maintains end-to-end 

        control of all emanating lines. The project relies on a private IP routing 

        scheme for our client stations and media servers. Remote management access 

        is also protected through access control lists that permit access only 

        to devices with authorized IP addresses, in addition to correct passwords. 

        The gateway to the Internet, also located at the ISP, provides network 

        address translation, thereby masking the identity of the originating workstations 

        and servers. In turn, the gateway is configured to provide anti-spoofing 

        protection and a multi-layered and firewalled environment to assure a 

        high level of overall security for components of our system. Similarly, 

        filtering at the gateway prevents our high bandwidth content from spilling 

        into and degrading service on the ISP's Internet backbone. Overall, 

        thanks to an ISP with end-to-end connection control and willing to provide 

        multicast broadband support for a small population, we expect to successfully 

        emulate the Internet of the future. </p>

      <h1>Content Capture, Transmission and Display</h1>

      <p class=Normal>While the fundamental infrastructure and core components 

        of this project have been described, there are key ancillary devices and 

        technologies worth noting, although elaboration exceeds the scope of this 

        paper. For live transmission we will use MPEG-4 (<a href="http://www.cselt.it/mpeg/" target="new">http://www.cselt.it/mpeg/</a>) 

        with its high ratio of full-motion video quality to bandwidth and other 

        features. For archival storage and video-on-demand we will use Cisco's 

        RTP format, which is essentially encapsulated MPEG-4 requiring IP/TVViewer 

        client software at the workstation. Content will be digitized locally 

        using Broadcast Servers and downloaded/transmitted via T-1 to the Archive 

        Server at the ISP hub. </p>

      <p class=Normal>Ancillary equipment associated with content production, 

        distribution, and storage include video cameras, microphones, mixers, 

        video editing system with special effects, video recorders, document cameras, 

        slide-to-video projectors and others. Some of these were already available 

        through our existing distance learning programs while others were acquired 

        for this purpose.</p>

      <p class=Normal>Work stations at participant sites will be standard PC's 

        with at least the equivalent of a PIII/600Mhz processor; the IP/TV Viewer 

        uses the processor to decode MPEG-4 and RTP media. Also,128 MB RAM will 

        be provided. At this time we have not identified any specific video or 

        audio requirements beyond the minimum generally provided with current 

        model workstations. Where a personal residence is the location of participation, 

        standard small speakers and a 17" monitor will be provided. For group 

        facilities, a 36" RGB monitor, appropriate speakers, and wireless keyboard 

        and mouse (if desired) will be provided, along with any special cart or 

        cabinet requested.</p>

      <h1>Program Operation and Management: Partners, Partners, Partners</h1>

      <p class=Normal>The technology plan described, although at the core of the 

        project, is merely a facilitator of the program. The program needs content 

        to distribute and participants to participate. If one concedes that the 

        Museum has designed a program that qualifies as "creative use" of technology 

        on behalf of the Museum's strategic goals, then there still remains 

        the question of where the mastery of complex technology should reside. 

        The answer is, with those whose core competency is technology. Similarly, 

        although the Museum has extensive experience in educational programming 

        within the scope of its expertise, there is more to Lifelong Learning 

        and the Arts than a single institution can provide. Finally, we needed 

        to identify and enlist community facilities and residents who would be 

        willing to join our experiment and work toward its success. </p>

      <p class=Normal>To achieve this level of distributed responsibility, participation 

        and interest, three spheres of "Partners" have been convened, many of 

        whom had been at our initial brainstorming meeting: Content Partners, 

        Community Partners, and Technology Partners. </p>

      <p class=Normal>Content Partners is a consortium comprised of the Museum 

        and additional arts and cultural institutions, including the Cleveland 

        Orchestra, one of the finest in the world; the Crawford Auto&#8209;Aviation 

        Museum of the Western Reserve Historical Society, a repository for artifacts 

        and archives related to the history of Ohio; and, WVIZ/PBS, the area's 

        public broadcasting station and active producer of educational television 

        programs. The number of content partners may grow as the program matures. 

        The combined resources of these organizations will provide a broad and 

        varied menu of programs in the areas of local history, visual arts, jazz 

        and classical music, theater and the applied arts, as well as a range 

        of thematic programs about general artistic, cultural and literary issues. 

        We are projecting a minimum archive of 300 programs by the end of year 

        two, in addition to a minimum of 12 live broadcasts offered monthly. These 

        organizations receive no payment for their contribution. It is noteworthy 

        that TOP grant conditions unequivocally stipulate that funds may not be 

        used to "produce information content," although it will support some "creation 

        or conversion of content (in order) to utilize information infrastructure 

        technologies to address real-world problems" (TOP Application Kit, 1999). 

        For example, the program is funded to videotape an already planned lecture 

        series, but cannot pay to create one. Content partner contributions of 

        time and any direct expenses incurred on the project's behalf are 

        recorded and considered in-kind match to the federal cash grant. The Museum's 

        Education and Public Programs Division manages the Content Partners.</p>

      <p class=Normal>Community Partner organizations bring a diverse population 

        to the program, including minorities and seniors, and those with varying 

        levels of physical and mental abilities. Organizations include several 

        assisted living community residential facilities; the Cuyahoga County 

        Board of Mental Retardation's training center; and a college-based 

        special educational program for persons age 50 and over. As the program 

        matures, participation may change. The personal commitment of community 

        partner staff is crucial to the success of the program. Community partners 

        have committed the time and talents of their on-site staff to facilitate 

        the use of the technology, to integrate the project into their ongoing 

        program activities, and to create follow&#8209;up activities so that their 

        clients can achieve the maximum benefit of this experiment. They have 

        also agreed to encourage use of the system for video&#8209;on&#8209;demand 

        and access to complementary Web resources. This includes making the equipment 

        accessible to clients for independent as well as group use. The partners 

        also agreed to take part in the evaluations, complete surveys and interviews, 

        and send a representative to meet at least quarterly to discuss the program 

        progress and recommend improvements. These organizations receive no payment 

        for their contribution. Their contribution of staff time spent in activities, 

        meetings or paperwork uniquely related to the project and any direct expenses 

        incurred on the project's behalf are considered in-kind match to 

        the federal cash grant. The Museum's Education and Public Programs 

        Division manages the Community Partners.</p>

      <p class=Normal>Technology Partners comprises technology organizations whose 

        core competencies are congruent with their projected roles. For example, 

        APKnet, Inc., the major regional ISP referred to above, will provide end-to-end 

        network management and connectivity services and support to our clients 

        and content origination/management points; that is, the Museum and WVIZ/PBS. 

        They will also co-locate the Archive and Control servers on their premises. 

        WVIZ/PBS, the area's public television station, will remotely manage 

        the Archive and Control servers, including video-on-demand sources and 

        broadcast scheduling. With an IP/TV Broadcast server on their premises, 

        they will also provide their studio as a live broadcast venue as well 

        as download content to the archive. Cisco Systems, Inc.'s Cleveland 

        office has committed to a special technical support effort and has contributed 

        training to assure that the project works. Keane, Inc. will help monitor 

        and evaluate the implementation. Museum Information Technology staff manage 

        the implementation process, and will perform all remote site equipment 

        set-up (except network connectivity devices), provide help desk support 

        for the project, and develop a friendlier end-user interface than is provided 

        with the IP/TV package. The vendor partners are participating on the basis 

        of fee-for-service and/or contribution/discount of services. Contributed 

        time and services from technology partners are accorded a value, which 

        is considered in-kind match to the federal cash grant. The Information 

        Technology Division manages the Technology Partners.</p>

      <h1>Project Evaluation</h1>

      <p class=Normal>Intrinsic to any federally funded project, and vital regardless 

        of auspice, is the ongoing and final formal evaluation of project process 

        and outcome. We have divided the evaluation into two distinct components: 

        technology implementation and program effectiveness. </p>

      <p class=Normal>In order to assess our technology implementation, Keane, 

        Inc. will identify and document all technical implementation, training 

        and support issues, problems and resolutions. This record should serve 

        as an important source document for any organizations that would like 

        to replicate in whole or part the technical program we are modeling. Our 

        Keane representative has been involved with the project from our initial 

        investigations and has an exceptional understanding of what we are trying 

        to achieve. However, since identifying the core technologies, Keane has 

        not been involved in specification or implementation, thereby enabling 

        an unbiased view of our process</p>

      <p class=Normal>In order to assess program effectiveness, we were fortunate 

        to have enlisted the Institute for Innovative Learning, Inc., led by noted 

        researcher John H. Falk. This non-profit research and evaluation organization 

        specializes in &quot;free choice&quot; learning and arts&#8209;related 

        programs and has extensive experience in evaluating Museum-based educational 

        programs.. Formative and summative evaluations, based on integrated evaluation 

        planning with all program partners, will encompass direct observations 

        by evaluators, focussed and open-ended interviews, questionnaires for 

        caregivers, and case studies as appropriate. Interim and final reports 

        will assess the efficacy of our approach and promote the sharing of our 

        experience. Ongoing informal feedback will help us navigate the program. 

        This Institute's involvement began at the very onset of the program, 

        even before our first formal <i>Partners</i> meetings were convened, and 

        we believe that early involvement of evaluators is essential to the evaluation 

        process</p>

      <h1>Budget and Staffing</h1>

      <p class=Normal>The formal budget for this program is $1.2 million over 

        a two-year period. Of this, $545,000 represents the Technology Opportunity 

        Grant financial assistance award. The remainder is matched through the 

        in-kind support of our Content, Technology, and Community Partners, and 

        the Museum's dedication of time of existing management and staff, 

        and direct expenses for some equipment and supplies. The federal contribution 

        is primarily used for hardware, software, initial network configuration, 

        and monthly telecommunications charges. Approximately 10% is applied to 

        evaluation. Federal dollars also directly fund 1.5 full-time equivalent 

        positions at the Museum: a full-time Project Coordinator acts as a liaison 

        between Program and Content providers and the Museum's project managers, 

        evaluators and others, performing a variety of functions to assure that 

        the program runs smoothly and effectively. A half-time Education Assistant 

        works with all content and community partners, including Museum staff, 

        to modify or enhance prospective content to better meet the needs of older 

        or impaired participants. A variety of staff from both the Information 

        Technology and Education and Public Program Divisions are involved with 

        this project as needed. The Museum's Informaton.Technology Division's 

        Help Desk also serves as the project's help desk. The Director of 

        Education and Public Programs is responsible for program content and working 

        relationships with our community partners. The Chief Information Officer, 

        who heads the Information Technology Division and is Project Director, 

        is responsible for all aspects of technical implementation, , all budget 

        management, reporting requirements, and program evaluation. </p>

      <h1>Current Project Status</h1>

      <p class=Normal>The grant award was announced on October 1, 2000. As this 

        paper is prepared in mid-February, 2001, following many planning meetings, 

        much of the IP/TV equipment has arrived. Technical staffs at WVIZ/PBS 

        and APKnet have been experimenting with demonstration units for several 

        weeks. Museum technical staff received a briefing and started demonstrating 

        IP/TV features to our Community and Content partners. This proved a significant 

        energizer for the group, who could finally see what they were getting 

        and know that it was for real. </p>

      <p class=Normal>The only big surprise is that there haven't been any 

        big surprises. Telecommunications lines have also been ordered and are 

        at the brink of hook-up but here, too, no surprise.... local DSL providers 

        do not really know if DSL is available at a location until the time of 

        installation. Although we "pre-qualified" community partner sites last 

        year, as to whether they could be connected, that turned out to be meaningless. 

        Possibly two of our participants may get T-1 connections until DSL is 

        really available. Site visits have been made to all community facilities, 

        in order to perform facility surveys for equipment selection and set-up, 

        and to start getting to know residents and staff (the "joy" part). </p>

      <p class=Normal>Our community partners have already participated in the 

        baseline stage of the program evaluation, which entailed the on-site collection 

        of baseline data about how staff feel about the forthcoming program, and 

        about the current state of social isolation, activity and relationship 

        with the arts of prospective participants. Here the feedback from our 

        evaluator has already proven invaluable. </p>

      <p class=Normal>First, our informal feedback was that our Community Partners' 

        staffs were extremely enthusiastic about the project and were already 

        identifying additional ways of using the technology before our first program 

        even "airs." For example, it was suggested that we share special programs 

        currently at one facility with another, or allow residents' talents 

        to be displayed live from our studios. One facility which has a regularly 

        scheduled discussion of social and political issues suggested that we 

        open it up for multi-facility participation or view. We are now challenged 

        to harness this energy and level of ownership which we never presumed 

        to rely on, nor expected to achieve at start-up. </p>

      <p class=Normal>Second, we have discovered that facility staff are planning 

        to target our programming toward persons who still maintain very active 

        lives, and have strong longstanding interests in the arts and our cultural 

        institutions. This may suggest that there is not much room for great improvements 

        for these folk in life satisfaction from our "diminishment of social isolation" 

        or "increased socialization" in this group (or maybe there is?). On the 

        one hand, this population might actively help us evaluate the quality 

        and effectiveness of our programming; on the other hand, this might preclude 

        us from impacting on a more needy population, giving us no more than a 

        short-term Pyrrhic victory. On the third hand, we do not want to dampen 

        staff enthusiasm or set ourselves up for self-fulfilling failure either 

        by second guessing their judgement or foisting our programs on participants 

        before we have ironed out the kinks. For now, we believe we have elegantly 

        solved this trilemma. We will enthusiastically beam our programming toward 

        the audience of the facilities' choice, respond to their feedback 

        and analyze our impact. As we become more experienced at content selection 

        and delivery, and facility staff become more confident in their use of 

        the technology and the success with their audience, we may urge that the 

        audience be expanded to those thus far deprived of participation. We may 

        even find that this occurs naturally over time without our intervention. 

      </p>

      <p class=Normal>The relevance of this scenario is not so much the problems 

        and issues it describes. More importantly, this story illuminates the 

        critical importance of early independent evaluation of program progress, 

        and thoughtfully deliberate intervention (or in this case lack thereof). 

        Without the early warning, this may have become an urgent issue bordering 

        on adversarial. Instead, we share an abundance of lemonade. </p>

      <p class=Normal>Content partners have also been meeting to develop our program 

        schedule, and the wealth of ideas is breathtaking: a special live marimba 

        and organ concert; our Art of the World appreciation course for adults, 

        videotaped and parsed into small morsels and archived for demand, complemented 

        by live follow-up conversation from the museum; an historian showing neighborhoods 

        of yesterday and today to stir memories, emotions, and intellect; a Panorama 

        of African American Theater from WVIZ/PBS. These are ideas and plans, 

        and fodder for another paper. One challenge will be to develop the synergy 

        of this program with the existing programs of the Content Partner institutions. 

        Recalling that grant conditions unequivocally stipulate that funds may 

        not be used for content development, it becomes all the more important 

        to sense what existing programs may be most amenable to re-purposing for 

        this program audience and technology. Another challenge will be to choose 

        programs selectively and carefully, learning from those that have proven 

        most and least effective and popular. Additionally, we may need to consciously 

        differentiate or vary programming to best match differently skilled members 

        of our target population. Learning from our success in art classes with 

        impaired populations, we will probably include live and archived activity 

        lessons, with guides for staff. Only one cloud hangs overhead; that is 

        concern raised by some content partners that in their enthusiasm for our 

        program goals, they may have underestimated the need for their institutions' 

        unreimbursed commitment of time and resources. This may result in a need 

        to attract more content partners, or our partners may find that their 

        contributions are not so onerous after all.</p>

      <p class=Normal>As we continued to walk through and talk through this program, 

        we recognized one more question to confront: Why should staff at our Community 

        Partner facilities actually believe this could be significantly beneficial 

        to their residents - more beneficial than TV or any other leisure activity? 

        Staff attitude in fact might prove key to project success. To help establish 

        insurance in this area, the Museum produced a day-long seminar, demonstration, 

        and pizza lunch for all of our Partners (Technology, Community, Content). 

        We featured a special film and lecture presentation by gerontologist Mal 

        Schechter, who had helped with our original research. Staff from the Cuyahoga 

        Community Board of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities demonstrated 

        how technology benefits the lives of the people they serve. All of us 

        focused on why we believe that this program is not just entertainment; 

        it's life enhancing. A pre-kickoff rally. And it got rave reviews.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class=Normal>This paper has tried to present the evolution of a notion 

        as it becomes an innovation. It has tried to relate the importance of 

        matching an institution's persona to an almost far-fetched goal. 

        It tries to make a case for developing sound inter-organizational relationships 

        as a means of achieving projects that would otherwise be out of reach. 

        And of course we are trying to demonstrate how advanced telecommunications 

        may bring cultural organizations closer, and with more profound impact, 

        into many more lives, in the not too distant future. If the process described 

        seemed too well thought out, too much on an even keel, a piece of cake, 

        then I may have abused my literary license. Guilty as charged on bypassing 

        some of the bumps in the road; we are just too busy trying to catch sight 

        of the potholes in the darkness ahead. But really, don't you just 

        love it when a plan comes together!</p>
