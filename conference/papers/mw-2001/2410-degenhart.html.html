      <h1 class="abstractTitle">Abstract</h1>

      <span class="AbstractText">The Museum Documentation Association, working 

      in collaboration with CIMI and other organizations, has developed an XML-DTD 

      based on SPECTRUM, an established museum process and documentation standard. 

      Of particular interest to the museum community is the potential this DTD 

      offers for the exchange of collections-based information. Imagine being 

      able to migrate data from your institution's collections management system 

      to another with the click of a button. This application is the basis for 

      CIMI's test bed this year. CIMI member, Bert Degenhart Drenth, Managing 

      Director of ADLIB Information Systems will discuss the impact of the SPECTRUM 

      XML DTD on data migration.<b></b></span>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class=normal><b>SPECTRUM </b>is a publication by the UK mda. It catches 

        the complete spectrum of activities that are performed to document and 

        manage a museum collection. SPECTRUM architecture consists of two components: 

        procedures and units of information. The SPECTRUM standard defines 20 

        procedures. Each of these procedures describes the steps than need to 

        be carried out to perform a specific task in a museum. Examples of such 

        tasks are: the entry of objects in the museum, loans of objects (in and 

        out) and risk assessment. A separate chapter is devoted to each of these 

        procedures. At the end of each chapter there is a list of data elements, 

        in SPECTRUM jargon named 'units of information'. The 20 procedures 

        form the first half of the SPECTRUM publication; the second half is an 

        overview of all the units of information, their definition and usage and 

        how they are linked with other units of information. The SPECTRUM standard 

        is widely used in the UK and is adopted in quite a few other countries 

        (specially Europe, e.g. Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands). SPECTRUM 

        is available from the mda in printed form or in electronic form. The electronic 

        version is called SPECTRUM interactive. More information about SPECTRUM 

        can be found on <a

href="http://www.mda.org.uk/spectrum.htm" target="new">http://www.mda.org.uk/spectrum.htm</a>. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>Although SPECTRUM is an essential instrument for museums 

        to organise their collection management, it does not contain any information 

        on how to implement the procedures and units of information in an automated 

        system. This task is left to the system vendor. As a result of this, different 

        interpretations of SPECTRUM exist and have resulted in different system 

        solutions. The SPECTRUM-XML work was intended to fill this gap and to 

        define a universal interchange format for systems that are based on SPECTRUM 

        or for non-SPECTRUM systems that export data to SPECTRUM-based systems. 

        In the long run a standard exchange format could save huge amounts of 

        time and money when museums migrate from one collection management system 

        to another. </p>

      <p class=normal><b>XML</b> is short for 'Extensible Mark-up Language'. 

        It is a descendant from SGML and as such a brother (or sister) from the 

        well-known HTML. Where HTML is used to define the <i>layout</i> of a page 

        on the World Wide Web, XML is used to define the <i>content</i> of a document. 

        In HTML you can specify that an area of text should be displayed in bold 

        characters and perhaps printed in red, in XML you can specify that an 

        area of text is a title or a subject... XML and HTML can work hand 

        in hand: when a document is marked up in XML then a transformation process 

        can turn the document into HTML so that it becomes a readable page on 

        the web. This transformation is performed through a so-called 'XSL 

        style-sheet'. The important thing to remember here is that XML is 

        not a replacement of HTML. </p>

      <p class=normal>Expressing museum data in XML is a very 'natural' 

        process: XML allows data elements (fields) to be infinitely repeated and 

        data elements can be nested. This means that data elements can contain 

        other data elements that can contain other data elements etc. etc, much 

        like a set of Russian Matryoshka dolls.</p>

      <p class=normal>The CIMI Dublin Core test bed was probably one of the first 

        applications of XML for museum data interchange. Although the use of XML 

        in this project revealed some initial problems, the use of XML made it 

        possible to join 200.000 metadata records from a wide variety of sources. 

        This certainly proved the power of XML as a data transport syntax.</p>

      <p class=normal>The use of XML has gained an enormous momentum. Some three 

        years ago it was very hard to find books on XML in bookstores. These days 

        you will probably find a whole bookcase devoted to the subject, including 

        titles like 'XML for dummies' (ISBN: 0-7645-0360-X). </p>

      <p class=normal>Major software vendors, including Microsoft and Oracle have 

        implemented support for XML in their products such as Microsoft Explorer 

        5.x and Access 2000 and Oracle 8<i>i</i>. The Collection Management Software 

        producers have also picked up this trend and have implemented or are implementing 

        support for XML in their systems. All in all it is fair to say that it 

        looks like "XML is here to stay".</p>

      <p class=normal><b>DTD</b> is short for Document Type Definition. XML alone 

        cannot guarantee that two applications can exchange data in a sensible 

        way. This is like two people talking the same language: the mere fact 

        that they both speak English does not necessary mean that they can have 

        a meaningful conversation. Just imagine a computer programmer having a 

        conversation with an art historian... Besides a common grammar (or 

        syntax) both parties have to have a minimum understanding about the meaning 

        of what is said. This is where a DTD comes in: a DTD defines which data 

        elements (units of information) are allowed in an XML document and how 

        they are structured. Different applications of XML therefore have different 

        DTD's. DTD's can be very simple (e.g. the CIMI Dublin Core Test 

        bed DTD) or be rather complex such as the SPECTRUM-XML DTD.</p>

      <p class=normal>DTD's have a rather awkward syntax that can be hard 

        to read. This is one of the reasons why the World Wide Web consortium 

        has been working on an alternative for DTD's under the name XML schema. 

        The XML schema work has currently reached Candidate Recommendation status. 

        This is the stage before becoming an official W3C standard. This stage 

        was supposed to end on December 15<sup>th</sup> 2000 (<a href="http://www.w3org/xml/activity.html" target="new">http://www.w3org/xml/activity.html</a>). 

        Because the XML schema proposal was not stable at the start of the SPECTRUM 

        XML work, it was felt that in this project the group should start with 

        the older DTD structure. In the future this could always be converted 

        to an XML schema.</p>

      <h1>Creation of the SPECTRUM XML DTD</h1>

      <p class=normal>The first ideas to create a DTD for SPECTRUM date back from 

        mid-1999 when a group of system vendors, together with the mda started 

        to discuss the subject at CIMI meetings. This was probably inspired by 

        the use of XML in the CIMI Dublin Core test bed. The project was started 

        with the set-up of a private E-mail discussion list on the 29<sup>th</sup> 

        of September, 1999. During the first months of the project all communications 

        were done through this list. </p>

      <p class=normal>The first face-to-face meeting was organised on the 31<sup>st</sup> 

        of March 2000 in the offices of ADLIB Information Systems in Swindon (UK). 

        Participants were the different system vendors (ADLIB, SSL and Gallery 

        Systems), mda (Gordon McKenna and Edmund Lee), Richard Light (independent 

        XML consultant) and Nicholas Crofts from Geneva. As one of the architects 

        of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) the presence of Nick Crofts 

        proved to be very useful: after a presentation by Nick it was agreed that 

        the ideas in the CIDOC CRM could serve as guidelines in the design of 

        the SPECTRUM-XML DTD. </p>

      <p class=normal>One of the most important outcomes of this was that the 

        DTD was not necessarily object-centric. In other words: the DTD should 

        support other views on the data e.g. starting from a person, an exhibition 

        or a loan. Another outcome was that the group wanted to take a look at 

        being able to re-use similar data structures that appear in different 

        places in SPECTRUM. An example of this is person data, where a person 

        has a relation with an object, e.g. being the donor or the creator of 

        an object. In this case the person can be seen as an 'actor' 

        on the object and the 'actor' and the object are connected through 

        an 'event' e.g. the creation or the donation of the object. 

        Borrowing this idea from the CIDOC CRM proved to be an important decision 

        that influenced the rest of the DTD design process. </p>

      <p class=normal>Subsequent meetings were held on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of 

        May, 2000 with the bulk of the work undertaken at a special "Lock-in" 

        meeting on the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> of July 2000 at the offices 

        of SSL in London. The final meeting was held at the 18<sup>th</sup> of 

        December 2000, again in London. The number of meetings was low in relation 

        to the amount of work that had to be done. This was only possible through 

        the use of the E-mail list and even more important: the effort of Gordon 

        McKenna from mda. Lots of useful comments also came from people outside 

        the "core" group, notably from Martin D&ouml;rr and Nicholas Crofts (CRM), 

        John Perkins and Angela Spinazze (CIMI). The 'wrap up' meeting 

        on the 18<sup>th</sup> of December 2000 produced three deliverables: the 

        DTD itself, a user guide for the DTD and a mapping from the SPECTRUM units 

        of information to the DTD.</p>

      <h1>The structure of the SPECTRUM-XML DTD</h1>

      <p class=normal>XML documents always contain a 'master' element 

        that contains all the other elements. This special element is called the 

        'root element'. The root element in the SPECTRUM-XML DTD is 

        named 'interchange' to indicate that the XML document is intended 

        for data interchange purposes. The root element contains two sub-elements 

        (or children) with the names 'metadata' and 'spectrum'. 

        The metadata element can contain information <i>about</i> the XML document, 

        such as who created it, for what purpose or when. The metadata element 

        can contain a complete Dublin Core description. The 'spectrum' 

        element contains the actual 'records' or 'descriptions'.</p>

          the three highest-level elements, 'interchange', 'metadata' 

          and 'spectrum'. The wrapper elements serve as 'envelopes' 

          around the real data. This is necessary to enable multiple top-level 

          elements and metadata in the XML document.</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal"><b>'Top level'</b> elements. The top-level 

          elements contain the museum's entities. There are eight top-level 

          elements: 'activity', 'concept', 'object', 

          'organisation', 'people', 'person', 'place' 

          and 'reference'. Top-level element can contain other top-level 

          elements: for instance places can be contained in object to represent 

          'associated places'.</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal"><b>'Structural'</b> elements. There 

          are 6 structural elements: 'actor', 'address', 'administration', 

          'description', 'entity-link', and 'identification'. 

          These elements act as glue to keep information together. A good example 

          of this is the 'actor' element when it connects a 'person' 

          to an 'activity'.</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal"><b>'Data'</b> elements. These contain 

          the lowest level data elements. There are 7 data-elements defined: 'aspect-numeric', 

          'aspect-term', 'aspect-text', 'date', 

          'name', 'note' and 'title'. </span></span></li>

      </ol>

      <p class="Normal">The contents of the elements can be qualified using 'attributes' 

        and 'values'. The possible attributes are also defined in the 

        DTD. Examples of attributes are 'lang' (language') or 'role'.</p>

      <p class="Normal">It is outside the scope of this paper to list all the 

        definitions and their possible attributes, but a simple example can probably 

        clarify some of the above described principles:</p>

      <h1>Deployment of the SPECTRUM-XML DTD</h1>

      <p class=normal>So far the SPECTRUM-XML DTD has been developed in isolation. 

        The next step will be to test the DTD in practical applications. All members 

        of the SPECTRUM-XML working group are also CIMI members. CIMI has already 

        expressed an interest in organising a test bed around the SPECTRUM-XML 

        DTD. An obvious advantage of this co-operation between the SPECTRUM-XML 

        group and CIMI is that the visibility of the project is lifted from a 

        UK based project to a world wide visibility. Furthermore, CIMI has considerable 

        experience in organising test beds. There are two possible applications 

        for the DTD: data exchange between collection management systems of different 

        vendors and the definition of a record syntax in distributed searching 

        applications.</p>

      <p class=normal>The first application is the most straightforward: export 

        data from collection management system from vendor A and import them into 

        the system of vendor B. At first glance it seems really simple to prove 

        that this application really works: if the data that have been imported 

        in system B will be exported using the SPECTRUM-XML DTD then one could 

        think that a simple file comparison could prove that the round-trip lost 

        no data and kept the data structure intact. This is not quite true: the 

        SPECTRUM DTD offers too much freedom in the expression of data to make 

        this test possible without further restricting the test conditions. An 

        example of this problem is that system A could export the data with the 

        'object' element as top element where system B could export 

        the data with the 'person' element as top element (object and 

        its maker(s) vs. maker and his/her object(s)). The formal validation of 

        the export/import application therefore requires additional test conditions. 

        This is where CIMI can offer its test bed experience.</p>

      <p class=normal>The second application is probably more exciting than the 

        first. Unfortunately a DTD alone is not sufficient for this purpose. In 

        addition to the definition of the record syntax one also needs a definition 

        of the query syntax. The simplest way to implement this is probably to 

        express queries as CGI (Common Gateway Interface) strings. If several 

        systems'vendors or their clients identify the need for this then 

        a similar project as the SPECTRUM-XML could be organised. </p>

      <h1>CIMI's involvement</h1>

      <p class=normal>The usefulness of SPECTRUM-XML can hopefully be tested in 

        2001. This would mean that during the course of 2001 various implementors 

        of Collection Management Systems will implement export/import functionality 

        in their systems. This functionality will then become available for their 

        cleints. This will result in a situation, which is referred to as 'standards 

        by stealth'. The individual museum does not need to worry about the 

        intricacies of the DTD. Their systems will contain the functionality by 

        default and the user will be able to inform the mda/CIMI work at a very 

        low cost. The potential of this approach goes well beyond any of the earlier 

        test beds of CIMI. The simple reason for this is that mainstream technology 

        is used for which hardly any usage barriers exist. This distinguishes 

        CIMI's XML projects from let's say the CIMI Z39.50 test bed. 

        Although the CIMI Z39.50 test bed proved without doubt that the technology 

        worked, the actual implementation of Z39.50 was blocked by the steep learning 

        curve of Z39.50 and the lack of support in off-the-shelf products. This 

        is entirely different in the implementation of XML based solutions: a 

        full range of products and components can almost be found at the nearest 

        street corner. </p>

      <h1>A future vision</h1>

      <p class=normal>Will XML and SPECTRUM-XML be the answer to all known problems 

        in the area of collection management? The answer is probably "no", although 

        for the first time there is a standard available that "naturally" fits 

        museum's data. What remains important is that data (and therefore 

        information) will be "conserved" in a system neutral form that guarantees 

        future usage of them. What most museums probably don't see is that 

        information about their collections is just as important as their collections 

        itself. So far I have not seen a job description for an information curator 

        yet. Using this analogy one could see the SPECTRUM-XML developments as 

        an information insurance policy: at least one can guarantee that data 

        can leave a specific system and be re-used in other (newer) systems. Organisations 

        like mda and CIMI are key in this development. Through test beds and projects 

        like SPECTRUM-XML these organisations can support and promote the implementation 

        of these insurance policies as best practice. Hopefully, the capability 

        to export/import data in a form like SPECTRUM-XML will, in the future, 

        be one of the top requirements in tender documents for future collection 

        management systems. </p>
