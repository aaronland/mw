      <p class=PaperTitle>Engaging Museums, Content Specialists, Educators, and 

        Information Specialists: A Model and Examples</p>

      <p class=Author>C. Olivia Frost, University of Michigan, USA</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>This paper describes a model for the use of the Web 

        to engage communities in better understanding and appreciation of cultures 

        through partnership among a knowledge organization, K-12 teachers and 

        learners, museums, and regional and virtual communities. Museums and 

        other content providers offer artefacts for object-based learning. Content 

        specialists contribute specialized content expertise and evaluate resources. 

        Education specialists develop, evaluate, and use materials for instruction. 

        Information specialists identify, evaluate, organize, and promote the 

        use of web-based and other information resources. They also develop tools 

        to capture and display content, to engage the teachers and learners in 

        dialogue, and to reach out and extend the content and resources to both 

        local and virtual communities. Communication tools enable members of the 

        local as well as virtual communities to provide reflections and engage 

        in dialogue, as well as to contribute their own content. Two recent projects 

        developed from the model are described, in addition to four previous projects 

        developed by the project team, that exemplify earlier applications of 

        the model. Lessons learned from the project work are identified, and the 

        paper discusses ways in which this type of project work reflects new roles 

        for the professionals participating in the projects, as well as changes 

        in the mission of their organizations and professions. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class=normal>Successful partnerships among different institutions or 

        disciplines are an attractive way of providing complementary expertise 

        in addressing needs of common concern and tasks that require a range of 

        knowledge areas. As professions evolve in their missions and their roles 

        expand and intersect with those of other disciplines, the potential for 

        effective synergistic partnerships increases. Professionals in museums, 

        libraries, the performing arts, and K-12 education have all undergone 

        profound misson changes which have resulted in greater emphasis on outreach 

        and new connections with members of other professional communities. At 

        the University of Michigan, some interesting and fruitful partnerships 

        have engaged members of the arts community, museum and library specialists, 

        faculty scholars, K-12 educators, and students from the School of Information. 

        From these has emerged a partnership model utilizing the information 

        and technology skills of librarians and information professionals, the 

        content knowledge of curators and scholars, and the expertise of K-12 

        teachers and other youth educators. The partnerships developed have broadened 

        the reach of arts and cultural heritage content by taking advantage of 

        the unique potential of information technology to disseminate content, 

        knowledge and ideas to a wide array of audiences, to provide context to 

        increase the understanding of cultural content, and to provide a means 

        of interactive and cross-cultural exchange of ideas and new creative work. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>This paper describes partnerships in two recent projects 

        which build on the model, as well as lessons learned in these and related 

        projects which exemplify earlier applications of the model. Finally, some 

        observations are offered on the ways in which this type of project work 

        offers the opportunity for professionals to assume some of the new roles 

        which are emerging as a result of the evolving missions of their organizations.</p>

      <h1>The Projects</h1>

      <p class=normal>The two projects which illustrate the partnership model 

        described in this paper are ones in which a faculty member and graduate 

        students at the University of Michigan School of Information play organizing 

        roles as part of the CHICO project (Cultural Heritage Initiative for Community 

        Outreach (<a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/" target="new">http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/</a>). 

        CHICO has as its mission to broaden the reach of cultural heritage resources 

        through the innovative use of information technology and through partnerships 

        with museums, schools, libraries, content specialists, and community arts 

        programs. CHICO collaborated with campus partners to provide a digital 

        showcase for events and exhibits in the arts. The resources were augmented 

        with contextual enrichment provided by content specialists. The site was 

        targeted to general audiences, with a focus on K-12 users. Delivery included 

        both Web-based resources as well as public events and activities in the 

        classroom with the partnership of K-12 educators.</p>

      <h2>Royal Shakespeare Company Project (RSC) <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/chico/rsc/" target="new">http://www.si.umich.edu/chico/rsc/</a></h2>

      <p class=normal>A landmark performance event at the University of Michigan 

        is the appearance in March 2001 of The Royal Shakespeare Company from 

        London for a three-week residency on campus and in the surrounding region. 

        The Company's performance of the complete cycle of Shakespeare's 

        eight historical plays and the residency of the actors, stage crew, and 

        education department engage University scholars and students, regional 

        community groups , K-12 schools, theaters, and local museums and libraries. 

        Educational and outreach activities developed for the event help K-12 

        teachers and learners learn not only about the plays themselves, but also 

        about the relevance the themes in the plays have in their everyday lives. 

        School of Information graduate students in the CHICO project have a role 

        in developing web resources to help increase appreciation and understanding 

        of the plays.</p>

      <h2>Food/Animals in Ancient Cultures Project<br>

        <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/AncientFood/" target="new">http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/AncientFood/</a><br>

        <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Animals/" target="new">http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Animals/</a></h2>

      <p class=normal>A University of Michigan professor who has done pioneering 

        work in providing a multidisciplinary approach to the study of classics 

        and archaeology worked with CHICO students to develop a web resource to 

        help K-12 students understand the role of food in ancient culture through 

        examination of artefacts in a local museum. SI graduate students had a 

        role in developing resources and tools to build a virtual and local community 

        of scholars, K-12 teachers and learners, museum experts, and other interested 

        people in the community with the goal of understanding how people lived 

        in ancient cultures and how these cultures have relevance in today's 

        times. </p>

      <h2>Collaboration roles</h2>

      <p class=normal>With a collaboration among museums, content specialists, 

        K-12 and outreach educators, and information specialists, there are roles 

        for partners providing service to the end-user, as well as roles for end-users 

        engaging with the content. Individual partners can play different roles 

        according to their degree of expertise, level of commitment, and ability 

        to participate in terms of time and resources. For us, the role distribution 

        was as follows:</p>

      <h2>Content provision</h2>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">creation of content (curators, scholars, information 

          specialists)</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">coordinating activities among the various partners 

          (information specialists)</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Audience</h2>

      <p class=normal>For the end-users and audiences, role<span class="Normal">s 

        include:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">engagement with peer learners</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">creation of artefacts and content which build 

          upon the collection </span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">feedback on the usability and usefulness of 

          the site</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>Engagement with Content Specialists</h1>

      <p class=normal>In creating web-based materials for both projects, the team's 

        goals were to create interest in and understanding of the topic; augment 

        the performance or museum visit experience; provide a means for further 

        study of the topic; provide mechanisms to engage in dialogue; and provide 

        a means for participatory experiences. </p>

      <p class=normal>The broad themes for structuring the sites included Relevance 

        and Connections; Context and History Background; and Behind the Scenes 

        (stagecraft, or mounting a museum exhibit). In both projects, CHICO team 

        members were able to take advantage of local content specialists, as well 

        as resources and events, all which contributee to content of the web-sites 

        and built upon the broad themes. </p>

      <h2>Content specialists in the Royal Shakespeare Company project</h2>

      <p class=normal>The visit of the Royal Shakespeare Company, organized by 

        the University Musical Society, provided a ready-made infrastructure, 

        including a collocation of content specialists and a wide array of planned 

        educational outreach activities, including public lectures, museum exhibits, 

        seminars, university class sessions open to the public, interviews, workshops, 

        and in-school visits. The audiences for the events include the general 

        public, university students, K-12 teachers and learners, and theater groups 

        throughout the area of Southeast Michigan and central Canada. </p>

      <p class=normal>In designing the site to establish relevance and connection, 

        the CHICO students envisioned a resource containing information, enriched 

        by images, maps, and links, to make clear the relevance of these plays 

        to a contemporary audience. The site would also contain material to encourage 

        people to make their own connections to the plays. An example is showcasing 

        adaptations of Shakespeare's plays that have been set in modern times 

        yet maintain the integrity of the text while framing the play in a contemporary 

        setting. The site would also provide context and history background for 

        the plays themselves, as well as provide information, images and links 

        to elucidate the history in the plays; for example, a historical timeline 

        and comparisons with instances of civil strife in the United States. Behind 

        the scenes information would provide background on the art of the play 

        in general, and specific information about the art of staging these plays 

        in particular. </p>

      <p class=normal>The CHICO student team members were interested in including 

        content about the political climate of the time when the plays were written 

        and showing how that related to the histories portrayed in plays to be 

        staged in Ann Arbor by the RSC. The team first attempted to do their own 

        research and compile materials from generalist sources to be presented 

        from a generalist's perspective. Upon encouragement, they looked 

        for expert help and were successful in recruiting assistance from specialists 

        to write key pieces. A widely-renowned English professor involved in the 

        RSC residency program will be giving a series of public lectures and agreed 

        to contribute content on the play's historical and literary significance. 

        This professor had just spent a week in England sitting in on rehearsals 

        of the plays and talking with the plays' director. A doctoral student 

        in theater, who coordinates the Shakespeare reading group on campus, also 

        agreed to contribute. The content specialists were also asked to write 

        short essays about Shakespeare's life, the history plays, and the 

        relevance of the history plays for a contemporary audience. </p>

      <p class=normal>The Royal Shakespeare Company submitted images of costume 

        designs and other materials; included was a file of photographs depicting 

        rehearsal shots and images of historical engravings. The students were 

        also successful in garnering permission to include ten essays requisitioned 

        by the University Musical Society for the event. In conjunction with 

        the project, the Curator of Special Collections at the Graduate Library 

        prepared an exhibit on costumes used in Shakespearean plays, to be on 

        display before and during the time that the RSC is in residence. The exhibit 

        contains costumes, prints, photographs, rare books and drawings illustrating 

        the clothing crafted for performances of Shakespeare's historical 

        dramas from the mid-18<sup>th</sup> century to the present. With the assistance 

        of the curator, CHICO team members selected and photographed materials 

        from the exhibit to include on the website. The Curator also gave the 

        students guidance on how to do research for other background content on 

        the project. In addition to providing their own original content, the 

        content specialists reviewed content developed by the students and evaluated 

        parts of the website to make sure the historical content of the website 

        is accurate. </p>

      <h2>Content specialists in the Ancient Food/Animals project </h2>

      <p class=normal>Through a university committee assignment, the CHICO director 

        made the acquaintance of a faculty colleague in archaeology and classical 

        studies, and the two exchanged information about their work. The classics 

        professor was teaching an undergraduate class in Classical Civilizations 

        called "Food in the Ancient World: Subsistence and Symbol." The students 

        were planning to use themes from the class to create an exhibit at the 

        archaeological museum on campus. The undergraduate students selected artefacts 

        and photographs from the museum, created display labels, and helped do 

        research for a website that would showcase the new exhibit. </p>

      <p class=normal>A partnership was quickly begun, and CHICO team members 

        were recruited to work with the professor and her class to help them with 

        the design and creation of a website to be targeted to K-12 teachers and 

        learners. The professor continues to get inquiries from visitors to an 

        earlier site on the topic created for a similar class four years ago, 

        and still receives frequent e-mail from K-12 students and teachers asking 

        for more information: "Are more reading materials available?" "Are there 

        recipes?" "And did they really eat peacock?" The professor responds when 

        she has time, but is not always able to keep up with the demand for further 

        information. She felt the interest was clearly there for an enhancement 

        of the existing foods web site as well as the creation of a new site on 

        animals in the ancient world. The new site would continue the theme of 

        Food in the Ancient World but would focus on animals: in hunting, as food, 

        as symbol and myth, as pets, and in relationships with humans, with K-12 

        as the primary audience. </p>

      <p class=normal>For the professor, time was an issue, since she was involved 

        in supervising the museum study for her undergraduate students and developing 

        signage for the exhibit. She felt it would be helpful if team members 

        could work independently or in tandem with the undergraduates. At the 

        same time, the team members wanted to work closely with the professor 

        and her students in creating the content material. They believed it would 

        be difficult, and even counterproductive, to create the content for the 

        website in isolation from the structure and design that the site would 

        have. Therefore, it was agreed that the team members would visit the class 

        and spend time observing the professor and her students </p>

      <p class=normal>For the Context and History part of the exhibit, CHICO team 

        members gained insight into the background of the content from the professor 

        and were provided with readings. In turn, CHICO gave presentations to 

        the professor's class about signage and labels for the exhibit artefacts, 

        and also shared information from the Education Curator at the UM Art Museum 

        about signage practices at that museum. A local radio station provided 

        digital versions of an interview with the professor conducted at the opening 

        of the Animals exhibit of the interview (in .WAV and RealAudio format) 

        to be mounted on the Web site. </p>

      <p class=normal>CHICO team members added new features to the existing Ancient 

        Foods site and updated the revised site to include both a regular HTML 

        version and a version in Shockwave format, with a link provided for viewers 

        to download Shockwave if needed. A Web site was created to accompany 

        the Animals exhibit that opened at the end of the term and would run for 

        several more months. The Museum had just acquired a touch-screen kiosk 

        for the 'in gallery' activities, and the team members created 

        a related resource for the kiosk, preparing a Director movie to use at 

        the Museum's kiosk based on the revised Foods site. A day was planned 

        for families to visit the museum, and this would be an opportunity to 

        advertise the project.</p>

      <p class=normal>For the Behind the Scenes component, team members photographed 

        the undergraduate students and some of the exhibit installation and exhibit-building 

        process. Students also met with the Associate Curator of Slides and Photos 

        at the Museum and were given background on the animal exhibit. This will 

        be included in a part of the site devoted to "Building an Exhibit" and 

        will provide a behind-the-scenes look at exhibition design and creation. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>To incorporate a Relevance and Connections dimension for 

        the site, CHICO worked closely with a sixth grade teacher and her class, 

        as described below. </p>

      <h1>Engagement with K-12 Audiences</h1>

      <h2>Ancient Foods/Animals Project</h2>

      <p class=normal>One of the CHICO team members was enrolled in a class on 

        digital resources for K-12, a school media methods course. She was interested 

        in "test driving" ideas learned in class with K-12 students and teachers, 

        and as part of the course, the student was required to teach some aspect 

        of information skills to K-12 students. Through her class instructor, 

        the CHICO student was connected with a local middle school sixth grade 

        teacher who had expressed interest in participating in the Ancient Foods 

        project. </p>

      <p class=normal>The sixth grade teacher had begun by asking her students 

        if anyone was interested in "old things, really old things." From the 

        initial response, twelve students were identified, drawn from several 

        classes. The team member and teacher agreed upon three different project 

        parts which could be explored using Eisenberg's model of the Big 

        Six skills (Eisenberg &amp; Berkowitz, 1990). The CHICO team member helped 

        the students find sites with information about animals in the ancient 

        world and worked with the sixth graders as fellow researchers. Together 

        they searched the web for appropriate sites from the new Web site that 

        could be used as resources for the project. The learners participated 

        as collaborators on researching the site, and the CHICO team member worked 

        with them on task definition, information seeking strategies, use of information, 

        appropriate citing of sources, organizing the information and putting 

        it together, and evaluation of the information found. </p>

      <p class=normal>An important activity was creating stories and materials 

        from the information gained in the research process. Once the students 

        had done preliminary Web research about the ancient works (specifically 

        on themes the UM undergraduate class was exploring for the project), they 

        explored ways that information could be used and interpreted by having 

        the students create stories and draw pictures based on their findings. 

        Some of these stories and pictures could then be included in the final 

        Website created for the Ancient Foods projects. The sixth graders are 

        creating clay models of ancient coins containing animal images, and these 

        will be included on the site as an example of student work. The first 

        step involved pencil sketches to be used as guides for the clay models 

        of animals. The team member photographed the art work with a digital camera 

        for inclusion on the site. The sixth graders have also found a number 

        of interesting sites related to animals in the ancient world. They may 

        be included in a resource section for teachers. </p>

      <p class=normal>The sixth graders will also be providing feedback on the 

        animal site as it develops. A key role for the K-12 learners is evaluating 

        the Website under construction for usability. Learners "test" the new 

        Website while under construction to determine whether it meets their information 

        needs. For the School of Information student, this provides a good opportunity 

        to apply usability assessment skills learned in coursework.</p>

      <p class=normal>CHICO also arranged a field trip to the Museum for the teacher 

        and students from the local middle school. The group was accompanied by 

        a team member who took photographs for later posting on the Animals Website. 

        The sixth grade teacher helped the team member organize the project activities 

        and made arrangements for a computer lab. The connection with the middle 

        school, the resources for museum education directed to youth, will be 

        useful to the museum as it focuses on becoming more oriented to youth 

        audiences. </p>

      <h2>Royal Shakespeare Company project</h2>

      <p class=normal>Engagement with K-12 in the RSC project was built on a wide 

        array of activities organized around the event by the University Musical 

        Society and its Education program. The RSC project afforded a number of 

        opportunities for engagement with schools and yout<span class="Normal">h-centered 

        activities. These included</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">youth performances </span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">workshops with K-6 and K-12 teachers </span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">activities taking place at K-12 schools</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">RSC visits with local schools </span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">workshops for museum curators</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=normal>Working with these groups, CHICO is gaining feedback on 

        the development of its site, as well as an opportunity to promote the 

        site's existence and to encourage audience participation by submitting 

        essays and artwork to be included on the site. </p>

      <p class=normal>CHICO students are developing a word game feature which 

        will allow K-12 learners to interact with the text of Shakespeare's 

        plays and get insight into its meaning. A map feature will allow learners 

        to look at a map of Great Britain and see where the various characters 

        and events in the plays are situated. The interactive map of cities helps 

        visitors to the site explore the theater scene. A participatory feature 

        of the site will encourage audiences to submit their own content, reflecting 

        on their own experiences with the plays, and creating new material -- 

        essays, drawings -- inspired from the plays. Content will be reviewed, 

        edited if necessary, and posted on the site. </p>

      <h1>Partnership on a Base of Mutual Self Interest</h1>

      <p class=normal>A key factor contributing to the success of generating and 

        sustaining commitment to the partnership is that there be a high degree 

        of mutual self-interest underpinning the participation of each partner. We have found it critical that there be a "win" for each participating 

        party. </p>

      <h2>Museums</h2>

      <p class=normal>For the participating museums or other content providers, 

        the benefits include</p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Rreaching out to a wider audience through digital 

          display of artefacts and increased visibility and access for the collection 

          </span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">providing a marketing vehicle which sparks interest 

          in the museum's content, promotes the museum's mission and 

          has the potential to build a new user base</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">providing contextualization which enhances appreciation 

          of objects, and provides interpretation for their understanding</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">providing enhancements to viewing objects, supplementing 

          but not replacing the physical museum visit. </span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Information Specialists</h2>

      <p class=normal>For students preparing for careers in the information professions 

        and their educators, the benefits include</p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">real-world experiences which bring together 

          multiple dimensions of information service</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">an opportunity to act in a service role</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">an opportunity to apply technical skills to 

          humanistic endeavours</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">the opportunity to apply a range of information 

          skills: selecting, acquiring, organizing, presenting, and evaluating 

          information</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">contact with end-users in museum and K-12 venues 

          </span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">project-based learning from an interdisciplinary 

          perspective</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>K-12 communities</h2>

      <p class=normal>For K-12 educators and learners, the benefits include:</p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">gaining access to a broad array of objects and 

          information in distributed form and thus expanding the base of learning 

          resources</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">the opportunity for learners to take what they 

          have seen and have read about an artistic experience and engage in dialog 

          with others</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">the opportunity to create their own artistic 

          and information content, building on what they have seen and heard. 

          </span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">the chance to extend an artistic experience 

          beyond the initial performance or museum visit</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Content specialists</h2>

      <p class=normal>For content specialists, the benefits include</p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">engaging with a broader audience in discussion 

          of their topic</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">an opportunity to provide outreach and service</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">a chance to think about their topic from a different 

          perspective and share that perspective with others outside the academy 

          or immediate scholarly or specialist community.</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>Changing Roles</h1>

      <p class=normal>The benefits of partnership will most likely appeal to those 

        who are exemplars of the changing boundaries of their profession. Each 

        type of institution represented by the partners has undergone some degree 

        of change in its mission, and a key part of the value of the partnership 

        can lie in its ability to offer opportunity to test some of the new roles 

        emerging in each of the professions represented. </p>

      <h2>Information professions</h2>

      <p class=normal>Education for information professions has been undergoing 

        profound changes recently, and at the heart of the changes are the changing 

        roles within the information professions themselves. Librarians, for example, 

        are now recognized increasingly as facilitators of learning and information 

        discovery, as providers of distributed content to users in remote venues, 

        and as practitioners whose skills are of value in a variety of information 

        venues. In addition, the delivery of instruction has changed to provide 

        more project-based, experiential learning. More explicit attention is 

        being paid to long-standing fundamentals of library and information service, 

        with greater emphasis on the end-user. As a result, schools educating 

        library and other information professionals must now provide educational 

        experiences which integrate classroom learning, technology, and practice, 

        deal with real organizational settings, are client-centered, and have 

        a strong service philosophy. </p>

      <p class=normal>While technology has recently been a driving force in the 

        profession, there is recognition that digital technology is at once an 

        enabling tool which makes different kinds of learning possible, and an 

        object of study itself, with impacts reaching into almost every branch 

        of human experience. Students of the information professions gain not 

        only from assisting many different types of clients in the use of information 

        and information technology, but also from observing the impacts of information 

        and information technology on environments such as museums and K-12 classes 

        (Frost, 1998).</p>

      <p class=normal>While technical challenges are daunting, more challenging 

        still are the human challenges brought about by information technology. 

        Students need to become acquainted with issues such as technology acceptance, 

        intellectual property, and information access. The project-based experiences 

        working with museum and K-12 clients can provide excellent examples of 

        these issues. </p>

      <p class=normal>In addition, projects with an arts and technology connection 

        are effective in attracting students who have learned technical skills 

        and want to apply them to interesting problems. Added to this is the opportunity 

        to provide a real service with a human dimension. These projects have 

        attracted students across the spectrum of our curriculum, from archivists, 

        librarians, and information policy specialists to human-factors and usability 

        experts and e-commerce specialists. </p>

      <p class=normal>When invited to participate in the Royal Shakespeare project, 

        one student exclaimed, </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I'm so eager to work on this project! In addition 

        to being a chronic Anglophile, I would feel honored to contribute to a 

        website that will provide such a valuable service to the community. What 

        makes my skill set especially applicable to this project is diversity. 

        Usually one finds programming proficiency in one person, creative/graphic 

        ability in another person, and writing skills in a third. My background, 

        however, includes all of the above. </p>

      <h2>Museums</h2>

      <p class=normal>Museum professionals<b> </b>also find themselves at a time 

        of change, with changes in their professional missions, an expansion of 

        their target audience, and new options for delivery of their content. Many museum staff have not grown up with computers, but now find that 

        technology has the potential to fundamentally change the way in which 

        museum content is delivered. At the present time, web surfers can visit 

        over five thousand online museum sites (Davis, 2000), and for many, the 

        digital experience may become the primary way a visitor comes into contact 

        with a museum exhibit. At the same time, the digital experience differs 

        in many fundamental ways from the experience of the original, and this 

        difference can vary with adult viewers (Taylor, 2000) and younger viewers 

        (Thompson, 1982). </p>

      <p class=normal>While it is obvious that the images seen by viewers on their 

        computer screens will vary in significant ways from those seen by viewers 

        in their visits to museums, perhaps less apparent is the way in which 

        different digital representations can also vary, depending on method of 

        image compression, screen resolution, and the like. Visitors scanning 

        a screenful of thumbnail images or pursuing a series of hyperlinked images 

        will browse the collection differently from those who are visiting the 

        physical collection in a sequential way (Frost, 2000). And of course the 

        experience of walking through a museum exhibit provides a whole array 

        of sensory effects of smell, sound, touch and institutional aura which 

        can at best be found in a computer experience in only a limited and experimental 

        way (Greenman, 2000). Added to this mix of questions is the social dimension 

        of museum viewing and its related impacts on individual and group experiences 

        both within and outside the museum (Chadwick, 1992, 1999, Falk &amp; Dierking, 

        1992). With the potential for interactive communication, will museums 

        be able to engage audiences in new ways? What is the role for computers 

        within museums? What are the curators' roles in interpreting museum 

        content, and how are these roles now being shared with educators? (Roberts, 

        1997) </p>

      <p class=normal>Similar to "talk-back" areas in a museum, where visitors 

        can post comments and questions about an exhibit, the Web offers opportunity, 

        for example through a Web-board, for visitors to respond to what they 

        have seen and to have questions answered by museum staff. How does this 

        new form of interaction affect the viewer's experience and relationship 

        with the museum?</p>

      <p class=normal>All of these new and interesting questions will require 

        that museums have direct experience in offering their collections in digital 

        form, in providing complementary and interconnected experiences, and in 

        giving viewers an opportunity to interact with both physical and online 

        forms of the exhibit. This will help museums address questions such as 

        the role of physical and virtual objects, and whether the virtual medium 

        will serve to promote or deter visits to the physical collection. How 

        can the virtual exhibit promote the afterlife of an exhibit, and how can 

        it help users become more informed before visiting the museum?</p>

      <p class=normal>At the same time that the technology revolution has been 

        changing museum practice, there has also been a change among many museums 

        in their core mission. Whereas the mission used to be to solely to collect, 

        preserve and exhibit works of art, that mission has now expanded to include 

        education and outreach to new audiences, especially for youth and populations 

        which have been historically under-served. Museum professionals' 

        roles have expanded from curators and directors to include educators, 

        marketing officers, and technology specialists. Educators may be more 

        closely involved in the planning of an exhibition. New vehicles exist 

        for displaying or enhancing the exhibits to include video, audio guides, 

        games, printed guides, CD ROMs, and Websites. </p>

      <h2>Content specialists</h2>

      <p class=normal>For the scholar, faculty member or other content specialist, 

        there is the opportunity to expand the reach for the topic of research, 

        to provide opportunity for engagement with new audiences, and to provide 

        an outreach service to the community. It gives an opportunity to bring 

        together the three key missions of teaching, research, and service. It gives the scholar a chance for interdisciplinary engagement with content 

        specialists in related areas. It also allows the faculty member, along 

        with the students, to explore new means of knowledge work using digital 

        technologies. While this type of involvement is not typical for faculty 

        members, developing on-line resources gives interested faculty an opportunity 

        to expand their roles as universities begin to place greater emphasis 

        on interdisciplinarity, outreach, and the integration of service into 

        teaching and research. </p>

      <h2>K-12 </h2>

      <p class=normal>Several decades ago, Dewey pointed out the importance of 

        experience in helping give meaning to abstract concepts and saw a special 

        place for museums and objects in education (Dewey, 1938), ideas which 

        still remain a force in contemporary K-12 museum education activities 

        (Hein,1998). With the appearance of Web-based museums and the ability 

        of access to primary resources and background materials, these concepts 

        take on new significance. In addition, new opportunities are afforded 

        for learners to interact with content and with other interested learners, 

        and to create and make sense of their own content. </p>

      <h1>Previous Projects Exemplifying the Model</h1>

      <p class=normal>The Ancient Foods/Animals and the Royal Shakespeare Projects 

        build upon a base of pilot activities which were examples of similar collaborations 

        with museums, K-12, information specialists, and content specialists. </p>

      <p class=normal>CHICO team members worked with museum curators to develop 

        a Website called Mummies of Ancient Egypt. This resource is aimed at K-12 

        students studying ancient Egyptian culture and is intended to complement 

        visits to local archaeological collections. (<a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/mummy/" target="new">http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/mummy/</a>). 

        While we did not directly involve K-12 communities in the development 

        of the projects, the site has generated years of correspondence from K-12 

        teachers and learners offering feedback. </p>

      <p class=normal>&quot;Harlem 1900-1940: An African-American Community&quot; 

        is a collaboration between CHICO and the Schomburg Center for Research 

        in Black Culture at the New York Public Library. The Schomburg asked CHICO 

        to provide an online virtual exhibit of one of its most popular collections, 

        a photographic portfolio depicting the Harlem Renaissance. At the core 

        of the exhibit is an online presentation of the Schomburg's compelling 

        portfolio, &quot;Harlem 1900-1940,&quot; featuring more than 30 archival 

        photographs. A section for educators, with lesson plans and discussion 

        guides, is aimed at K-12 teachers and learners. (<a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Harlem/" target="new">http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Harlem/</a>) 

        A similar partnership with the Schomburg resulted in the creation of a 

        site called The African Presence in the Americas (<a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Schomburg/" target="new">http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Schomburg/</a>).</p>

      <p class=normal>In partnership with the Smithsonian's National Museum 

        of the American Indian (NMAI), CHICO team members helped transform a site-specific 

        exhibit into an interactive, multimedia resource available to global audiences. 

        CHICO staff developed the exhibit based on content developed by Alaskan 

        Native American Yup'ik Elders, with an NMAI exhibit curator (<a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Yupik" target="new">http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Yupik</a>). Building on this resource, a faculty member and graduate student in the 

        University of Michigan School of Education developed an interactive educational 

        resource with content provided by Yup'ik students and educators. Yup'ik 

        elders also worked with CHICO staff to transform the online exhibit into 

        a CD ROM featuring additional oral histories and audio resources.</p>

      <p class=normal>CHICO and the UM Museum of Art (UMMA) joined forces in a 

        collaborative project with local middle-school students, art and technology 

        teachers, the museum director of UMMA, and the outreach coordinator of 

        CHICO to collectively enhance the learning process through an experimental 

        elective course. In the Stylistic Journey Project, CHICO developed a 

        Webboard which was used extensively to facilitate online discussions among 

        teachers, curators and students (<a

href="http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Emerson/)" target="new">http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Emerson/)</a>.</p>

      <p class=normal>In a CHICO partnership with the University of Michigan Museum 

        of Art and a local school, a set of fifth graders from a local school 

        were engaged in developing an exhibit guide which would reflect their 

        perspective but also have its content reviewed and validated by UMMA curators. Together with the UMMA museum professionals, the students, their art teacher 

        and the school's technology specialist, CHICO helped create &quot;Monet 

        at Vetheuil&quot;, an online, interactive exhibit guide. Youngsters were 

        able to research specific artistic resources and painting techniques in 

        consultation with curatorial experts, and to create their own works of 

        art based on their experiences and learning. A bulletin board and online 

        quiz facilitated communication among students, educators and the exhibit 

        curator, and welcomed responses from a global audience (<a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/monet" target="new">http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/monet</a>).</p>

      <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>

      <p class=normal>In the course of implementing and evaluating the projects, 

        a number of recurring themes and issues have surfaced to assist us in 

        future development of similar sites. </p>

      <h3>Intellectual Property issues</h3>

      <p class=normal>Since copyright takes on new dimensions in the digital world, 

        many of the assumptions to which we had become accustomed are changed 

        or no longer valid; many old assumptions are challenged. One example is 

        the ownership of items in the collection of a museum or archive and our 

        ability to use them in collections. For example, if a museum educator 

        wants to create a site for teachers in which she uses images from her 

        local museum, and if that museum "owns" all the material in its collections, 

        and with it all donated items, does that mean that the museum is free 

        to make images of these items universally available through the Internet? Although a museum or other repository may "own" a photograph, painting 

        or statues, and may have been given the right by the donor to display 

        that object in the collection, that does not necessarily entitle the institution 

        to post images of the item on the Web. Instead, such "ownership" conditions 

        needed to be re-negotiated, and securing permission to use digital objects 

        may involve going beyond their original "owner."</p>

      <p class=normal>In addition, we found it critical that agreements be worked 

        out in advance and in writing indicating the ownership and disposition 

        of the intellectual property of the content provider, as well as how the 

        project team may use or distribute the content in the course of the project 

        work. </p>

      <h3>Rules of disengagement</h3>

      <p class=normal>The CHICO projects have as one of their main goals the provision 

        of educational experiences for information students. While the development 

        of Websites is a key means of providing these experiences, the project 

        is not serving primarily as a production unit, and decisions must be made 

        in a way which balances the educational needs of the students with the 

        needs of the project partners. Staff change each year, with new students 

        entering, graduating, or moving on to other projects. Staff skill levels 

        vary. Accordingly, decisions must be made as to when to move a site to 

        the CHICO archives (and notify viewers that the site is no longer being 

        actively maintained), when to continue maintenance and upgrading, and 

        when to remove a site outright. Ideally, a site would be handed off to 

        the participating project partner for maintenance, but this is not always 

        feasible. If a site is to be continued, how can it be kept active and 

        fresh while new projects are developed? This can be a key problem since 

        student participation is voluntary. Students are more likely to be attracted 

        to the development of a new site in which they have a stake, and for which 

        they can take credit and can cite in their job search portfolio. </p>

      <h2>Coordinating schedules and goals</h2>

      <p class=normal>University course projects need to be coordinated within 

        the framework of the academic term or semester, but in real life, project 

        activity does not always fit neatly within this timeframe. Project expectations 

        and deliverables need to be managed within these constraints, without 

        penalizing students for difficulties beyond their control. Difficulties 

        in coordinating meetings are to be expected, and this can cause a lag 

        in project work, yet the students expect to be actively involved in a 

        project in the course of a term. If the project experiences a serious 

        delay, the students are encouraged to try to fill in this time with project 

        activities within their control (e.g., developing background information, 

        locating information resources, or preparing draft proposals of work for 

        reaction from the project partners). If the student teams experience a 

        major setback, the project goals need to be adjusted, and in the unlikely 

        event that the problem is not correctable, the students are encouraged 

        to focus instead on an evaluation and assessment, with recommendations 

        based on lessons learned. </p>

      <h2>Matching skill levels with project needs</h2>

      <p class=normal>The projects are designed to allow student participation 

        at various skill levels. Projects start off by doing a skills inventory 

        to determine what skills students have and need. Students are then pointed 

        to resources, on campus and elsewhere, that can assist them in gaining 

        new skills. Students are paired with experienced team members, and novices 

        of one year become seasoned trainers in their second year. Where possible, 

        projects are matched with skill level and interest. SI students generally 

        have a variety of backgrounds, with both content and technical expertise 

        reflected in the team membership at any given time. </p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class=normal>This paper has described a model for community partnerships 

        involving information specialists in training, museums and other content 

        providers, content specialists, and K-12 teachers and learners. The focus 

        has been on two recent activities involving partnerships with museums, 

        libraries, and a performing arts group. The experiences have provided 

        a valuable opportunity for information specialists, museum curators, and 

        K-12 educators to gain insight into new roles in their changing professions.
