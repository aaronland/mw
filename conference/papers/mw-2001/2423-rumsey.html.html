      <p class=PaperTitle>Historical Map Collection Web Site</p>

      <p class=Author>David Rumsey, Cartography Associates and Luna Imaging Incorporated, 

        USA</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The David Rumsey Historical Map Collection Web site 

        includes over 4,400 high-resolution images of rare maps from Rumsey's 

        collection of more than 150,000 maps of the Americas, one of the largest 

        private map collections in the U.S. The site is powered by Luna Imaging's 

        Insight software. Launched on March 15, 2000, Rumsey's site was the 

        first Luna-designed site to go public with unlimited access to users without 

        charge. This paper will discuss issues surrounding the site's purpose, 

        design, and operation, including metadata management, digital image creation 

        and preservation, site usage and economics, sharing web based archives, 

        and future directions for online collections.</p>

      <p class=normal>Only a short time ago, the mere idea of a link between maps 

        printed centuries ago and today's digital world of the Internet might 

        have seemed ridiculous. However, these two different worlds contained 

        the seeds of amazing collaborative possibilities, which are just now being 

        realized. To understand how this has come about, it is helpful to look 

        at the broader changes that are occurring today with regards to libraries 

        and the Internet. Until recently, libraries only made catalogs of their 

        materials available on the Web. Now Libraries are starting to actually 

        deliver text and visual materials to their Web visitors via high-resolution 

        images of maps, photographs, prints, books, and other cultural heritage 

        objects (including film, video, and audio) along with metadata linked 

        to each image or information file. This is leading to the development 

        of large virtual libraries accessible to the public, world wide, for the 

        first time.</p>

      <p class=normal>Who is doing the work of creating digital libraries? Evidence 

        of serious institutional commitment to digitizing our cultural heritage 

        abounds. The Library of Congress has been an early leader with its American 

        Memory project that includes photographs, maps, text, manuscripts, film, 

        audio, and ephemera. The Mellon Foundation has launched several important 

        initiatives, including JSTOR (a huge archive of scholarly journals), digitization 

        of MOMA's design collection and the ancient scrolls of Dunhuang, 

        China, and the formation of a sister virtual archive to JSTOR tentatively 

        called ARTSTOR that will focus on visual resources for scholars. Research 

        Library Group (RLG) recently announced a major effort to create an integrated 

        digital collection of cultural materials held by its members. And the 

        New York Public Library has begun the implementation of its Visual Treasures 

        project, which will create an immense virtual library of 600,000 images 

        documenting social and cultural history. NYPL also has several other digital 

        projects either on the Web or soon to be launched, some on its own and 

        some in collaboration with other libraries and universities. Of special 

        interest to me is NYPL's project to digitize over 1300 early maps 

        of the Middle Atlantic Seaboard. One can reasonably predict that the number 

        of new digital initiatives will increase exponentially over the next five 

        years, coming not only from the larger institutions, but also from smaller 

        archives and private holdings, and from many parts of the world. </p>

      <p class=normal>What does this mean for the future? Because these new virtual 

        libraries will be digital in structure, they can be linked and shared 

        with other virtual libraries, including museums and other archives. This 

        will "break down the walls" between content types and lessen the traditional 

        separation of paintings from maps, film and video from sculpture, photography 

        from music, and so on. Geographical separation of archives will be eliminated 

        by having simultaneous Web access to collections in North America, Europe, 

        Asia or anywhere on the globe. Historical maps will play an important 

        role in the new digital libraries because their content is uniquely suited 

        to digitization: high resolution scanning of historic maps reveals a richness 

        of detail that makes the map content "expand" as one zooms into finer 

        and finer levels of information. Maps can be seen as kinds of dense systems 

        of information that the process of digitizing and then displaying with 

        powerful software tools can make visible -- in fact, make visible 

        many things that we may have missed when viewing the originals. Maps are 

        like virtual libraries in themselves: they hold huge amounts of information 

        that is visually cataloged on their surface by location, symbol, color, 

        type, and scale.</p>

      <p class=normal>Historical maps will benefit in several ways from these 

        developments. They will become far more accessible to the general public 

        as well as scholars and students. In this process, they will become part 

        of our public historical memory, in the same way paintings and photographs 

        are. These maps will begin to be seen in their cultural context. By being 

        included in large digital libraries of contemporary cultural heritage 

        materials, we will find new meaning in maps, and maps will add new meanings 

        to our understanding of the culture of their times. Maps will be able 

        to be compared and studied as part of a vast shared virtual library of 

        map holdings worldwide. Scholars and students will have greatly increased 

        simultaneous access to the holdings of different institutions from many 

        countries without having to travel great distances -- and they will 

        have access all the time, 24 hours a day. Attendance at map libraries 

        will actually increase as people become more familiar with historic maps 

        over the Internet. People will always value seeing the "real" thing. </p>

      <p class=normal>Against this background, I would like to share some specific 

        details and lessons learned from the development of the Rumsey online 

        collection, as an example of the process of moving cultural heritage materials 

        from their, in my case, rather private physical existence, to their public 

        digital life. </p>

      <p class=normal>I had 20 years of preparation for going &quot;digital.&quot; 

        I used a database as soon as I began building the physical collection 

        of my library. This database shaped the growth of the collection and allowed 

        for truly contextual collecting -- seeing the relationships between 

        the collected maps by subject, graphic type, time period, author or publisher, 

        or geographic location. The use of a database allowed me to visualize 

        the collection in a &quot;data space,&quot; and this facilitated the growth 

        of the collection into a coherent whole (in my case, maps of North and 

        South America from about 1700 to the present). As the collection grew 

        to more than 150,000 maps, the database was essential in maintaining depth 

        to the various parts of the collection by showing which sections of the 

        collection needed additions and how new items might flesh out the collection 

        -- such as letters of a map publisher that revealed his cartographic 

        and business practices.</p>

      <p class=normal>I began to formulate a definition of what was required to 

        create a virtual library on the Web: high-resolution images in sufficient 

        number and in meaningful relationships (in other words, a strong collection) 

        that would allow for serious scholarly research and educational use, as 

        well as use by the general public; detailed metadata for each image that 

        could also express relationships between images (such as the parts of 

        an atlas in order); powerful onsite searching and sorting capabilities; 

        effective printing tools; and excellent viewing software that allows one 

        to examine the online images and create the feeling that you are holding 

        them in your hands.</p>

      <p class=normal>My familiarity with (in fact, dependence on) a collection 

        catalog database made it natural for me to add high-resolution digital 

        images of the maps to the metadata. I began the imaging process in 1997 

        around the time that high-resolution camera scanners became available, 

        along with the development of image compression software called MrSid, 

        by Lizardtech. Also at this time I established a relationship with Luna 

        Imaging and started using an early Java Client version of their Insight 

        software to display my first map images on the Web. I began the process 

        of choosing which maps to digitize first - the existence of the catalog 

        database was critical in both selecting which parts of the collection 

        to start with and build from, and in avoiding the traps of either choosing 

        only the "greatest hits" or beginning with the "a's" and arriving 

        at the "z's" years later. Using the database, I broke the collection 

        into its major categories and then began to select items for digitizing 

        from each of those categories in sufficient number to provide depth. Some category examples are globes, civil war maps, maps of states, counties, 

        and cities, important atlases, maps in Americana books, and so on.</p>

      <p class=normal>On the technical side, Cartography Associates immediately 

        established standards for scanning images of at least 300 pixels per inch, 

        measured against the object's physical size (and in many cases, up 

        to 600ppi if the smallest detail on the map justified it). We decided 

        to use camera scanners instead of flatbed scanners because camera scanners 

        gave us the depth of field required for images of books and atlases. Furthermore, 

        the use of a copy-stand digital camera with side lighting results in a 

        stronger sense of the map as an object, which is essential in today's 

        2-D Web space. Color management was accomplished by calibrating all monitors 

        to a standard with colorimeters, using color bars in saved image files 

        as well as creating color profiles for all parts of the production line 

        (scanners, monitors, and printers) and saving color profiles in the images 

        themselves. Lenses were tested for maximum depth of field. Florescent 

        lights were chosen for color consistency and minimum heat on the objects. 

        The MrSid compression software was tested for compression levels that 

        created the least artifacting in the MrSid image. Light smoothing software 

        was employed to even out variations in image brightness -- especially 

        important in knitting together multiple shots of large originals. Once 

        all of these elements were in place, we were able to produce between 50 

        and 100 images a day, including derivative production and archiving the 

        originals.</p>

      <p class=normal>For our metadata format we chose initially to create our 

        own &quot;Rumsey&quot; set of fields in the Access database to allow for 

        the fairly complex relationships of objects and containers: an atlas had 

        to be represented as a whole by a &quot;container&quot; field, and in 

        its parts by other fields, and all the parts had to be in a proper sequence, 

        i.e. the same sequence as in the book. MARC format is not intended to 

        easily handle this kind of problem, although we are currently cataloging 

        in both &quot;Rumsey&quot; and MARC because of MARC's ubiquity in the 

        library world. And the Luna software can now translate our data structure 

        on the fly to Dublin Core or VRA. I suspect that over time certain consistent 

        metadata standards will evolve for Web-based online libraries. For the 

        present, one has to contend with several competing standards.</p>

      <p class=normal>On March 15<sup>th</sup> of last year we launched <a

href="http://www.davidrumsey.com/">davidrumsey.com</a> with 2,300 online images 

        and data. The site increased its holdings to more than 3,000 images in 

        July 2000. By the beginning of 2001 we had about 4,400 images online, 

        and expect to have 10,000 by the end of 2001. The collection is accessible 

        to the public in two formats: a browser version that can be easily accessed 

        by Netscape or Internet Explorer, and a downloadable version called a 

        Java Client that, while it takes the time to download, offers advanced 

        functionality.</p>

      <p class=normal>When you make the decision to bring a private collection 

        into the public domain of the Internet, anything can happen. I had high 

        hopes of reaching a new, undiscovered audience when I launched davidrumsey.com--but 

        I certainly didn't expect my antiquated, somewhat academic endeavor 

        to be covered by <i>Wired</i> magazine, let alone to be chosen as the 

        Site of the Week by South Korea's Ginseng Chicken Factory Web site.</p>

      <p class=normal>The reality of going online and maintaining an online library 

        produced some interesting and revealing experiences for me. </p>

      <p class=normal>First, we reached a much larger audience than we expected. In the 12 months that we have been online we have had over 200,000 total 

        visitors and about 10,000,000 hits. Average visit length is about 10 minutes. 

        United States visitors make up about two thirds of total visits, with 

        international visitors accounting for the balance. &quot;.Com&quot; visitors 

        are about 25%, &quot;.Net&quot;about 25%, &quot;.Edu&quot; about 25%, 

        and all others about 25%. Visits per day ran from 500 to 6,000. We were 

        astonished at this volume of visits because typically, map libraries draw 

        around 2,000 to 6,000 visitors per year (UC Berkeley around 6,000, Stanford 

        about 2,000). In my own library I had about 200 visitors over 20 years. Our visitor rate for the past year, 200,000 annual visitors, is about 

        the number of visitors to the typical university map library over a period 

        of 50 years. Is the quality of the visit as good as the &quot;real visit&quot; 

        to the map library? I think so. The Web-site visitor enjoys easier access 

        to the material, high-resolution images, comparisons, printing copies, 

        searching, speed, etc. Does it take the place of a real visit? Not at 

        all. Exposure to the material on the Web-site library should encourage 

        more visits to the physical library by allowing people to first search 

        and focus on what they want to see via the Web, then go and see the actual 

        object at the physical library. </p>

      <p class=normal>Our browser software was successful in getting us directly 

        and quickly to our users. Users did not have to download any software 

        -- they could access the collection directly using Netscape or Internet 

        Explorer browsers. Users were able to find us on the Web through the search 

        engines and directories. Many of our users downloaded the Java Clients 

        after they had experienced the collection with the browser, for greater 

        functionality and the ability to download high-resolution image files 

        for printing. Users have downloaded over 8,000 Java Clients, about 4% 

        of the total visits. However, the type of users that visited was different 

        from what we expected: 50% were from the &quot;general public&quot; with 

        about 25% from schools and universities and the other 25% from &quot;.gov&quot;, 

        &quot;.org&quot;, &quot;.mil&quot; and unknown. We expected the general 

        public percentage to be smaller. To us this indicated that the public 

        is hungry for interesting and well-presented material on the Web. Users 

        did find us easily on the Web as we appeared in the major directories 

        and search engines with good reviews (Best of Net at Yahoo and About.com, 

        Editors Choice at Netscape, Lycos, and DMOZ, Site of the Day at USA Today, 

        and others).</p>

      <p class=normal>The Web site has created a public presence for the collection. 

        We are a private collection that is not open to the general public. We 

        needed a Web "house" to get our maps out for public use. Luna's Insight 

        software architecture creates the feeling of a "place" where people can 

        go and examine things as if they were holding them in their hands. We 

        are now listed with all the major institutional map libraries in the Web 

        directories. Our online map library is equaled in size only by the Library 

        of Congress Map site. </p>

      <p class=normal>We have been able to function as a model for other collections 

        headed online. Many institutional map libraries that wanted to go online 

        and were interested in information have approached us. I think most of 

        them are convinced by our site that the experience of using a map online 

        with good software is very close to working with the real thing and has 

        the obvious advantages of easy delivery anywhere, combined with eliminating 

        the wear and tear involved in working with the original maps. Private 

        collectors are also interested, but in most cases they will need support 

        from major map libraries in going online because of the technical requirements 

        -- however, this should be an exciting area of collection development 

        for many institutions -- by helping private collectors move their 

        materials online, they are more likely to be the recipients of those actual 

        materials as donations in the future.</p>

      <p class=normal>We have been able to keep the site free to all users. Users, 

        to our knowledge, have been respecting our copyright rules and there has 

        not been a mass downloading of images with the Java Clients. Users are 

        very appreciative of the fact that the site is free and open. Several 

        interesting revenue opportunities have arisen to license the images and 

        data to large Web sites that want to display the images within their own 

        browser environments. We are currently working out an arrangement with 

        Ancestry.com, the largest genealogy site on the Web with over 100,000 

        visitors a day. Another company would like to do high-resolution art printing 

        of the maps to sell site visitors. Revenues from these arrangements will 

        allow the free site to continue.</p>

      <p class=normal>The site has been in operation 24 hours a day, 7 days a 

        week, since March 15, 2000, the day we launched. We have been down a few 

        times, but never for very long, and most of those problems have been solved. 

        The software scales well, working fine with hundreds of simultaneous users. 

        We have not had to provide a huge amount of tech support and the vast 

        majority of users figure out how to use the site without problems. What 

        problems we did have invariably resulted from users with older, slower 

        computers and less then 56k modems. Broadband is becoming more widely 

        accessible and we will benefit from this. Our high morning and afternoon 

        hourly usage patterns show that many people are signing on from work where 

        they have fast lines, but the evening traffic is picking up as more cable 

        and DSL lines are installed in homes. </p>

      <p class=normal>Our users found interesting applications for the site. Many 

        K-12 teachers have used the site with their classes and we were chosen 

        as &quot;school site of the day&quot; on Discovery.com. The intuitive 

        design of the Luna software allows for easy use by young students and 

        advanced researchers alike, although it appears that most students use 

        the simpler browser version while scholars eventually switch to the Java 

        Client version for its advanced and somewhat more complex features. Civil 

        War researchers are major users of the more than 100 Civil War maps on 

        the site. Genealogists use the site to find where their ancestors lived. 

        Map collectors and map dealers use and link to the site. Many of the major 

        map libraries and collections link to the site and several feature it 

        prominently as a resource. Several Web design sites, including the prominent 

        &quot;Project Cool&quot; have featured the site as a demonstration to 

        designers of what is possible with sophisticated software design. The 

        site has been used by home school organizations. We had more international 

        use than we expected: we were featured in prominent news Web sites in 

        England, France, Portugal, Brazil, Sweden, Estonia, Slovakia, Norway, 

        and certain factories in South Korea already mentioned. And most of all, 

        the general North American public has used the site far more than we expected, 

        and judging from the emails we got, many of these users had not been exposed 

        to historic maps before. Returning visitors numbered about 15% per day 

        indicating roughly that visitors returned to the site about once a week. 

        In order to maintain that we will have to continue to add material to 

        the site. However, map image databases have the advantage of containing 

        an extraordinary amount of visual information in each image: currently 

        we have about a terabyte of information on the site, with average image 

        size of over 200 megabytes. It will take a user many visits to examine 

        everything on the site in detail.</p>

      <p class=normal>Putting digitized cultural heritage materials on the Web 

        offers us the opportunity to significantly increase the number of people 

        using these collections. From our experience, we feel that there is a 

        potentially huge audience on the Web for interesting cultural content 

        of all kinds, as long as it is well documented and well presented. Focused 

        or specialized content can find large numbers of users on the Web - historical 

        maps are certainly in this category, not being generally recognized as 

        &quot;art&quot; objects. Through the vast reach of the Web, you can find 

        your audience for almost anything, and it will be much larger than you 

        think. </p>

      <p class=normal>However, collections can't just launch their sites and sit 

        back and wait for the traffic to appear. The Web has over one million 

        new pages a day added, and if online collections do not take the time 

        to become a part of the immense Web cataloging system, their audience 

        will not see them. Collections all take the time to catalog their individual 

        collection items; similarly, they must take the time to see that their 

        Web collection is cataloged as a whole and in its significant parts by 

        the search engines and directories. This is done by structuring the collection 

        Web-site home pages so that they best reflect what the collection is about, 

        as this will be seen by the search-engine spiders and is the basis of 

        their indexing; by submitting the site to all the major search engines 

        and directories; and by creating additional site pages that break down 

        the collection into broad themes - this is especially important for dynamic 

        sites like ours that have most of their content hidden in an internal 

        database that is not visible to the search-engine spiders. With the increasing 

        use of Limited Area Search Engines (or LASE's), that are non commercial, 

        from the academic world and usually focused on specific subjects (hence 

        limited) there is hope that the secret algorithms of the commercial search 

        engines and the inevitable frustration of trying to figure out how they 

        will catalog your site will be replaced with transparent and rational 

        cataloging methodologies. Examples of LASE's are Argos, Hippias, 

        and DevSearch.</p>

      <p class=normal>Working with user profile information generated by the site 

        server log is very important. Using good Web log analysis tools such as 

        Webtrends allows collection managers to understand who is coming to the 

        collection site, what they are viewing, where they were referred from, 

        what search engine they used, how long they stayed, and so on. It is actually 

        possible with log analysis software to have an as good or better idea 

        of the site visitor activity as you would of a collection's physical 

        visitors. This information can be useful in decision-making concerning 

        the growth and direction of an online library.</p>

      <p class=normal>There is rising concern among collection managers about 

        copyright issues associated with going public on the Web. I think the 

        best way to deal with copyright and security concerns is to create different 

        groups or levels of the collection. One level could be all pre-1923 material 

        that is clearly in the public domain (this is the case with almost my 

        entire collection, fortunately) and that can be taken public without problems. 

        The next level could be post-1923 material or material that is for other 

        reasons not suitable for the public domain, allowing this level to be 

        used within a limited community only or with other institutions on site 

        only. Another level could be for use only within the museum or library, 

        and so on. The legal status of copyright of the digital images themselves 

        remains in flux. The Bridgeman case asserted that there could be no enforceable 

        copyright for digital images. Undoubtedly there will be further rulings 

        and appeals. My view is that ultimately, the legislative process will 

        newly define copyright and other intellectual property issues in the near 

        future. As a practical matter, we have found that the vast majority of 

        users respect our copyright and work with us to license the images.</p>

      <p class=normal>Going on the Web may hold real financial benefits to collection 

        owners, though this remains to be proven. Several possibilities exist: 

        substantially increased Internet use and attendance may make the collections 

        more able to attract government and corporate funding; judicious licensing 

        of content to appropriate online educational/information sites can produce 

        revenues; printing of reproductions is a possible revenue source. Collection 

        development may benefit by collaborating with private collectors to digitize 

        their holdings as a first step in bringing their materials into an institution. 

        I suspect other possibilities exist that we can't see today. Currently, 

        in most cases, charging for access by the general public to an online 

        collection is not feasible. In the future, it may be. Ancestry.com provided 

        an interesting recent example of charging the general public for access 

        -- they launched their 10-million image database of the US census 

        from 1790 to 1920 and promptly sold more than 30,000 one-year subscriptions 

        for about $30 each, bringing in more than 1 million dollars in revenue.</p>

      <p class=normal>Going public on the Web with high-resolution image access 

        to cultural materials today is still seen as only an option by most libraries 

        and museums. I suspect that in a few years, it will become as necessary 

        as keeping an institution's doors open to the public. The public 

        will get a taste of the wonder and excitement of Internet access to great 

        collections and they will want more. Those institutions that get in early 

        on this phenomenon will be able to shape the agenda and create the early 

        &quot;brands&quot; of the great online collections. Those that wait too 

        long will have to play catch up later.</p>

      <p class=normal>We are working on several new initiatives for our site that 

        are worth mentioning. We are proceeding with a project with UC Berkeley 

        to take all of our metadata and upload it to their online Web library 

        catalog called Melvyl, with a URL in each record's MARC 856 field, 

        that when clicked will open up the map detailed on that record, directly 

        from our online collection. This will allow catalog searchers at the University 

        to find us via the university catalog and at the individual map level, 

        as opposed to coming in our "front door" and then searching for that map 

        with our own search function. These will be records for the digital images 

        of the maps as opposed to records of the physical maps, and as such will 

        be unique records created within OCLC and thus available for downloading 

        by participating OCLC members. </p>

      <p class=normal>Another new project will be MapLibraries.com, a collaborative 

        site of the Rumsey Collection and the Library of Congress Map Division. 

        Initially the site will have about 8,000 images, half from each collection. 

        We hope to add other participants in the future. As part of the project, 

        we have constructed a Luna site for the LOC. From the homepage of MapLibraries 

        one can access either the Rumsey Collection or the LOC collection individually, 

        or together. Instead of browsing online map resources at separate Web 

        sites or traveling great distances to view maps at different libraries, 

        all the image holdings of participating institutions can be viewed and 

        searched together. This allows for comparison of map images side by side, 

        while the actual physical maps being viewed may be in libraries separated 

        by thousands of miles. The newest version of the Luna Insight software 

        will support searching across sites with different metadata structures, 

        and allows for a distributed model in that data and images can be accessed 

        from separate collection servers. Currently, participating sites must 

        be using the Luna platform. In the future, it may be possible to include 

        participants in some fashion that are on non-Luna platforms. Image duplication 

        is a real issue and initially we will favor non-duplication of shared 

        image content to conserve limited resources for scanning. Access schemes 

        may vary among participants, with some participants having entirely open 

        access and others having access only within certain communities. The software 

        can also allow for these different access levels. </p>

      <p class=normal>We will be starting our own Limited Area Search Engine (or 

        LASE) for maps. The purpose of this LASE will be to catalog online map 

        collections at the item level, instead of at the collection level. In 

        other words, it will be a catalog of actual digital map images available 

        on the Web. We will incorporate this into the MapLibraries.com site. We 

        would like this project to be a demonstration project that would encourage 

        others to create LASE's for other subject areas. Eventually, individual 

        LASE's could be combined.</p>

      <p class=normal>Also we will continue to work closely with Luna Imaging 

        on enhancements to the software. Coming soon in version 3 of the Insight 

        software: an image annotation tool, multiple rotating image views, drag 

        zooming, cross collection combining and searching including support for 

        mapping between different data structures (MARC, VRA, Dublin Core, etc.), 

        support for video and audio, linking from images to other resources, measurement 

        and scaling tools, defining different access and permissions for a collection, 

        and changing to a fully relational database allowing the utilization of 

        tables such as Getty's Thesaurus of Geographic Names.</p>

      <p class=normal>We will georeference our maps so that they can be displayed 

        in GIS systems and used by GIS based historians and others. This means 

        establishing the correct latitude and longitude of the map's four 

        corners and its scale. The map can then be downloaded from our site and 

        displayed in GIS programs like AcrView or ArcInfo. Then historical data 

        such as population, climate, or locations can be displayed as layers on 

        top of the historical map; modern data can by used in the same way. One 

        can imagine using GPS devices to show one's exact position in a georeferenced 

        historic map. Historical data can also be extracted from the maps through 

        digitizing, and combined with other data and displayed. Working with GIS 

        in this manner raises some concerns that a map's identity as a cultural 

        object will give way to its use as a data source. I think it is important 

        to always identify which maps have been "distorted" into correctness through 

        georeferencing and to always consider the original ungeoreferenced image 

        as the primary image to be archived, with the georeferenced images classified 

        as derivatives.</p>

      <p class=normal>Finally, we will participate with other online cultural 

        collections of non-map images such as Yale's Imaging America project, 

        in order to integrate our map collections with paintings, photographs, 

        art and architecture historical images, and other cultural heritage objects. 

        We hope that this will allow historical maps to function in a larger context 

        and perhaps move maps more into the cultural mainstream.</p>

      <p class=normal>In conclusion, our experience with the Rumsey online map 

        collection indicates that even focused, specialty archives such as ours 

        can have great usefulness to the public when they are made freely accessible 

        on the Internet using high-resolution images, solid metadata, and advanced 

        viewing software. One can reasonably forecast that the growth of online 

        archives of all types and sizes will increase exponentially over the next 

        five years. The challenge then will be to avoid the &quot;balkanization&quot; 

        of separate resources by providing powerful linking and cross-collection 

        searching mechanisms that will effectively unite all the archives into 

        a digital &quot;Alexandria&quot; while maintaining their separateness 

        and uniqueness as collections.</p>
