      <h1 class="PaperTitle">Virtual Museum Collaborations for Cultural Revitalization: 

        The Four Directions Model</h1>

      <h2 class="Author">Mark Christal, Loriene Roy, Paul Resta, Antony Cherian, 

        University of Texas, Marty Kreipe de Montaño, National Museum of the American 

        Indian, USA</h2>

      <h1 class="abstractTitle">Abstract</h1>

      <p class=AbstractText>The Four Directions Project, funded by the U. S. Department 

        of Education, is an education project with the goal of using technology 

        to support culturally responsible education for Native American Students. 

        One culturally responsive teaching strategy is virtual museum projects 

        done in partnership with museums that hold important cultural items. The 

        paper describes the learning project that led to in the creation of the 

        Virtual Tour of the National Museum of the American Indian. Emerging from 

        this experience is a Four Directions model for school-museum partnerships 

        for virtual museum projects. The model considers such projects in the 

        context of three overlapping concepts: culturally responsive education, 

        cultural revitalization, and cultural collaboration. The model is illustrated 

        through a description of virtual museum project activities from both the 

        educator and museum professional perspective and through an account of 

        the development of American Indian education and contemporary museums.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Keywords: virtual museum, virtual tour, culturally 

        responsive education, cultural property rights, authentic learning, project 

        learning, American Indian Education, Native Americans, school-museum partnerships, 

        museum education, QuickTime Virtual Reality, QTVR</p>

      <p class=normal>Museums have long been the repository of important cultural 

        items. They make these objects available for public exhibition in carefully 

        designed architectural spaces and more recently on CD-ROM and in the virtual 

        space of the World Wide Web. In presenting their collections in carefully 

        crafted and coherent exhibits, museums educate the public and perpetuate 

        our cultural heritage.</p>

      <p class=normal>Schools share the mission of cultural preservation with 

        museums. They are natural partners in developing effective educational 

        experiences for young citizens. Schools are also responding to the challenges 

        of the 21<sup>st</sup> century by integrating new technologies into classroom 

        practice. Creating a virtual museum as a classroom learning activity is 

        one emerging strategy schools are exploring. This method uses new digital 

        media, the World Wide Web and multimedia authoring to instruct students 

        as they construct an educational resource for others. Some of these projects 

        have been created in collaboration with public museums (McKenzie, 1995; 

        McKenzie, 1996; Roy &amp; Christal, 2000) .</p>

      <h1>An Emerging Model</h1>

      <p class=normal>The authors of this paper are educators and museum professional 

        partners of a major education project. Our participation in virtual museum 

        projects has helped us to see the virtual museum as an emerging model 

        for school-museum collaboration. Though the model focuses on a specific 

        type of museum and a particular population of students, we feel that it 

        can be adapted to suit other museums and student populations.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Four Directions project has been fortunate to have two 

        museum partners that have given Native American students access to the 

        important cultural property that remains in museum collections. These 

        experiences are providing an evolving concept for museum-school-community 

        collaboration that serves needs of all participants: students, educators, 

        museums and the general public. We call this paradigm the Four Directions 

        model for virtual museum collaboration. Three aspects of our experience 

        with virtual museum projects guide the Four Directions model:</p>

      <p class=normal><i>Culturally Responsive Teaching</i> -- Virtual museum 

        projects can be culturally responsive because they can teach through the 

        culture of the child to bring community concerns and values to the center 

        of the teaching-learning process. Students are motivated to excel because 

        they are doing important, original work to recover and preserve their 

        heritage. They gain from the knowledge of museum professionals and the 

        wisdom of community elders. They develop skills in research, writing, 

        social studies, science, mathematics, information literacy, and cutting-edge 

        information technology.</p>

      <p class=normal><i>Cultural Revitalization</i> -- A common concern among 

        Native American peoples is the recovery and preservation of their cultures 

        and languages. Much of what remains of traditional material cultures resides 

        in museum collections far from Native American communities. Virtual museum 

        projects provide a way for communities to "digitally repatriate" precious 

        items of cultural heritage. In the Four Directions Model, virtual museum 

        activities also take place in the Native American communities. Students 

        research and record local materials that supplement the museum's 

        resources for the virtual museum. Local resources such as oral histories, 

        cherished heirlooms, traditional stories, dances and songs, native language 

        and contemporary arts get combined with museum materials to present the 

        vision of a vital, living culture.</p>

      <p class=normal><i>Cultural Collaboration</i> -- Although museums aim 

        to preserve heritage and educate the public, Native Americans sometimes 

        object to the way museum exhibitions appropriate cultural property. Native 

        Americans often want the public to have access to authentic knowledge 

        of their histories and cultures, but they also believe that some aspects 

        of their cultures should not be shared with outsiders. Virtual museum 

        collaborations can provide a venue to address thorny issues of cultural 

        property rights, to design protocols for cultural collaboration and to 

        decide levels of access. </p>

      <p class=normal>These three dimensions of the model interact with each other. 

        For instance, students who work on creating virtual museums of their Native 

        American cultures are participating in an authentic, culturally responsive 

        learning project that also revitalizes their communities' cultures by 

        enhancing community access to cultural material in museums that may be 

        far away. Also, when museums offer Native American communities access 

        to their collections in such virtual museum projects, they are entering 

        into a type of cultural collaboration where the interpretation, accessibility 

        and appropriation of important cultural property is negotiated rather 

        than dictated.</p>

      <p class=normal>This paper will present observations of school-museum partnerships 

        for virtual museum learning projects in the light of this emerging model. 

        Three of the authors are educators (Christal, Roy, &amp; Resta), and one 

        author is a museum professional (de Montaño). The paper will, therefore, 

        present viewpoints from both the education and museum perspective. Also, 

        two of the authors are Anglo-American (Christal and Resta) and two are 

        of Native American descent (Roy and de Montaño). Thus, both professionally 

        and ethnically, this paper is itself an example of cultural collaboration. 

        We present our model based primarily on our shared experiences in creating 

        the Virtual Tour of the National Museum of the American Indian (<a href="http://www.conexus.si.edu/VRTour)" target="new">http://www.conexus.si.edu/VRTour)</a>, 

        a project in which students from three American Indian schools participated.</p>

      <h1>The Four Directions Project</h1>

      <p class=normal>Four Directions is a five-year project funded through a 

        U. S. Department of Education Challenge grant. Its purpose is to promote 

        the development of technology-supported culturally responsive teaching 

        for Native American students. The partners in the project include nineteen 

        American Indian schools in ten states that are part of the Bureau of Indian 

        Affairs school system, four university partners, and two museum partners. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>The Four Directions project recognizes the current lack 

        of curriculum responsive to the cultures of Native American children. 

        It also realizes that technology can provide a way to empower these local 

        communities to create curriculum that fits their needs (Allen et al., 

        1999) . The historical circumstances of American Indian education further 

        stresses the need for culturally responsive approaches. In the late 19<sup>th</sup> 

        Century, it was United States policy to force Native Americans to assimilate 

        European-American culture. The federal government enforced this policy, 

        among other measures, by eroding the Indian's traditional culture 

        as it relocated them to tribal reservations and by instituting a boarding 

        school system for Native children that forbade the expression of all aspects 

        of traditional culture (Adams, 1995) . Because of these historical circumstances, 

        much of what remains of American Indian material culture resides away 

        from their homelands in museums across the nation and in private collections. 

        Still, many Native Americans clung to their cultures as well as they could 

        under the circumstances. By the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century 

        European-Americans gradually began to value the cultures of the continent's 

        first peoples and to celebrate the cultural diversity of the nation. American 

        Indian schools began to include aspects of Native cultures in their curriculum, 

        and since the mid-1960s an increasing number of American Indian schools 

        have come under direct tribal control (Szasz, 1977; Tippeconnic III, 1999) 

        .</p>

      <p class=normal>Despite the gains in Indian control since the 1960s, it 

        is not enough to offset four centuries of domination and paternalism. 

        The Indian Nations At Risk Task Force, chartered on March 8, 1990, studied 

        the status of native education and reported that:</p>

      <blockquote>

        <p><span class="BlockQuote">the existing educational systems, whether 

          they be public or federal, have not effectively met the educational, 

          cultural, economic, and social needs of Native communities... If Native 

          cultures remain important today, as many Native political and educational 

          leaders believe they do, they must again become a part of the educational 

          process. Tribal groups must develop educational structures built on 

          their cultural priorities and foster continued development and growth. 

          Schools must do their part in supporting this movement </span></p>

        <p><i class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Hirschfelder &amp; de Montaño, 1993, p. 

          99).</i><i class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> </i></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p class=normal>Today, for Native American educators, according to the 1976 

        Report by the National Advisory Council on Indian Education (NACIE), Indian 

        education means</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><span class="BlockQuote">a method of teaching that revives an appreciation 

          for Indian heritage and generates a positive self-image . . . educational 

          policies should respect the wishes and the desires of the Indian people 

          to design and manage their own educational program . . . [they should 

          have] full involvement of Indian parents and community members... [and] 

          include the method and content of teachings, which are designed and 

          developed by Indian educators and Indian people reflecting Indian concepts 

          and cultural values</span> </p>

        <p><i class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Hirschfelder &amp; de Montaño, 1993, p. 

          102).</i></p>

      </blockquote>

      <p class=normal>It is in this context of contemporary American Indian education 

        that the Four Directions project formed to promote culturally responsive 

        education for Native American children.</p>

      <h1>The Four Directions Virtual Museum Projects</h1>

      <p class=normal>In the fall of 1998, three of the Four Directions partner 

        institutions--the Pueblo of Laguna Department of Education, the Univeristy 

        of Texas, and the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI)--began 

        the first collaboration that brought Native American students, teachers, 

        and community members to the NMAI George Gustav Heye Center Museum in 

        New York City to create virtual museums. To help guide this first virtual 

        museum project, Dr. Paul Resta drafted a concept paper, which has become 

        the first explicit description of the Four Directions model for school-museum 

        collaboration. In it, he explains the rationale for the collaboration:</p>

      <p class=normal>For many years, Native American culture was undervalued 

        and suppressed in America. Although the richness of Native American historical 

        and contemporary cultures has begun to be recognized, exemplary curricular 

        materials based on this richness are rare. In addition, in a rapidly changing 

        world, much traditional wisdom will be lost before there is an opportunity 

        for Native American students to learn about their own history and culture, 

        and to share what is sharable with the world community. Teachers trained 

        in methods of cultural sensitivity and in the use of technology may provide 

        leadership in the accessing, preserving, and sharing of Native American 

        culture with the world community. One means of doing so is for Indian 

        schools and communities to use technology to collaboratively develop <i>virtual 

        museums </i>(Resta, 1998, p. 3).</p>

      <p class=normal>Students and teachers were to select objects from the museum 

        collections in close consultation with community elders. The elders would 

        help determine which objects were sharable and, in doing so, would lend 

        their knowledge and perhaps their voices to the virtual exhibition.</p>

      <p class=normal>Local community participation and development were priorities 

        in the original concept paper. Each school community that was to participate 

        in the virtual museum project would send a team of students, teachers, 

        and community elders to the museum to select, record and research the 

        materials to be included in the virtual museum. In addition, a summer 

        program was proposed for each participating school community. In the summer 

        program, community members would bring valuable cultural materials to 

        the school to be recorded in digital photographs or QuickTime Virtual 

        Reality for a local virtual museum. Local landmarks, natural settings 

        and historical sites would also be recorded. Students could record tribal 

        elders speaking about important objects, people, events and places in 

        English and their native language to add to the local virtual museum. 

        Some of the sharable locally created materials could supplement the materials 

        offered in the virtual museum on the museum's server. In exchange, 

        the media created at the museum could be "digitally repatriated" to the 

        local community for use within the community. Thus, two virtual museums 

        could potentially emerge from each museum-school community partnership: 

        one offered by the museum and accessible to the public on the World Wide 

        Web and another with access restricted to the local community. The first 

        would offer only materials that tribal leaders had deemed sharable in 

        that venue, and the second, local virtual museum would include more sensitive 

        materials for community access only (Resta, 1998) .</p>

      <p class=normal>That the first school-museum collaboration between Four 

        Directions schools and the National Museum of the American Indian could 

        not strictly meet every aspect of Resta's concept demonstrated not 

        a deficiency in the project but the flexibility of the partnership. The 

        NMAI was in the process of moving its entire collection to a new facility 

        in Suitland, Maryland. Consequently, the full collection was inaccessible 

        at the time of the proposed project. The items in the museum's current 

        exhibitions, however, were accessible to the project. This meant that 

        very few artifacts that reflected a given student's specific Native 

        American culture would be available. As a compromise, students from several 

        of the Four Directions schools decided which items in the exhibitions 

        they wished to feature to create a virtual tour of the museum through 

        the eyes of American Indian children.</p>

      <p class=normal>In the spring of 1999 two school teams, one from Santa Clara 

        School (Pueblo, New Mexico) and one from Hannahville School (Potawatomi, 

        Michigan), traveled to New York to research and digitally record the student-selected 

        items from the NMAI exhibitions. These materials were assembled into the 

        Virtual Tour of the National Museum of the American Indian, which has 

        been accessible via the World Wide Web since February, 2000 (<a

href="http://www.conexus.si.edu/VRTour)" target="new">http://www.conexus.si.edu/VRTour)</a>. 

        In May, 2000, Marty Indian School (Lakota, South Dakota) sent another 

        team to extend the tour. The additional material was added to the virtual 

        tour in fall 2000.</p>

      <h1>Museum Staff Activities</h1>

      <p class=normal>Nearly every department of the National Museum of the American 

        Indian became involved in the Four Directions/NMAI collaboration, but 

        the Resource Center, managed by Marty de Montaño, coordinated the activities 

        and hosted the visitors from the schools. NMAI staff found the Web to 

        be a wonderful tool to prepare students before they came to the museum. 

        The staff uploaded information about the museum to a private web site 

        on the museums web server for the students to access before they came 

        to visit. These documents provided information on the different departments 

        in the museum and what each department did. The students, therefore, not 

        only learned about the inner workings of a museum, but they knew a little 

        more of what to expect when they arrived in New York. </p>

      <p class=normal>NMAI also used the Web to communicate the progress of the 

        project. At school, the students selected objects from exhibit catalogs 

        provided by the museum and e-mailed their list of objects to the Resource 

        Center. Staff placed images of the chosen objects on a private Web site. 

        The museum's Conservation and Exhibition departments let Resource 

        Center staff know which objects could realistically be taken out of their 

        exhibition cases for QTVR photography. Museum staff communicated this 

        information by annotating the images on the Web so the students would 

        know which objects were available for their projects.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Web was also used for planning and coordinating the 

        de-installation of objects and the scheduling of panoramic photography. 

        Floor plans of the galleries were posted on the Web and the schedules 

        were indicated on the floor plans. </p>

      <p class=normal>The students knew beforehand that they would not be allowed 

        to touch or handle the artifacts and that some of the objects would not 

        be suitable for QTVR treatment. Some were too fragile; some, like buffalo 

        robes, were essentially flat; some exhibit cases were too difficult to 

        open; some objects were too difficult to reach without de-installing other 

        objects. They knew that the conservator would decide which objects were 

        suitable for photography based on their condition. They knew that no food 

        or even water would be allowed in the VR studio where the objects were 

        photographed.</p>

      <p class=normal>The project schedule was adjusted to fit into the museum's 

        schedule and to take into account that most of the students were grade 

        school students. Panoramic photography in the galleries took place between 

        8 and 10 a.m., before the museum opened. The students photographed the 

        galleries while object handlers and exhibit personnel de-installed the 

        objects that were to be photographed that day. Project planners scheduled 

        four objects each day for QTVR photography, which proved to be a reasonable 

        pace for the students. When the museum opened to the public at 10 a.m. 

        half of the students photographed objects in the photo studio while other 

        half researched the objects in the Resource Center library for the label 

        content. By 3 p.m., the students were finished for the day. This schedule 

        roughly followed their school day. The students were then free to explore 

        New York City while the museum staff reinstalled the objects. The reinstallation 

        could then take place during the relative quiet of the late afternoon 

        rather than during the rush hours between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. when the 

        galleries are full of touring school groups.</p>

      <p class=normal>Many of the other museum departments were involved in this 

        project. The Education Department needed to know which objects were de-installed 

        each day. The cultural interpreters could then omit from their talks objects 

        that had been removed. The Security Department had to be on hand to keep 

        visitors away from cases while the de-installation and reinstallation 

        were in progress. One case had gold in it and required an armed guard 

        be on hand when the case was opened. </p>

      <p class=normal>After the Conservation and Exhibition departments approved 

        the list of objects to de-install, the Registration department had to 

        know the location of each object. Object handlers from Collections Management 

        were the only ones authorized to handle the objects. Finally, the museum 

        hired a mount maker to make mounts for the objects so they could be propped 

        safely on the turntable for QTVR photography. </p>

      <p class=normal>Resource Center staff coordinated the entire undertaking, 

        assisted in research for label content, arranged for catered lunches and 

        provided computers for the students and hospitality for everyone.</p>

      <h1>The NMAI Virtual Tour</h1>

      <p class=normal>The virtual tour makes extensive use of QuickTime Virtual 

        Reality (QTVR), which had been identified at the beginning of the Four 

        Directions project as having significant potential in educational applications. 

        All of the Four Directions schools have been offered training in the creation 

        of QTVR media. There are two types of QTVR movies: panoramas and object 

        movies. QTVR panoramas (panos) are made from a series of overlapping photographs 

        taken from a tripod using a specially designed panning head. Software 

        "stitches" the photographs into one seamless 360<span>°</span> scene. 

        To interact with a panorama, one presses the mouse button when the cursor 

        is on the movie and moves the mouse cursor in the direction one wishes 

        to look. The panorama then scrolls in that direction. </p>

      <p class=normal>The second type of QTVR media is the object movie. To make 

        an object movie, one places the object on a turntable and takes a series 

        of pictures at evenly spaced angles while turning the object. To interact 

        with a finished object movie, one presses the mouse button when the cursor 

        is over the movie and moves the mouse in the direction one wishes to rotate 

        the object. The QTVR photographer can, furthermore, make more complex 

        object movies by using a specially designed object rig to move a camera 

        around an object vertically. The resulting movie has both vertical and 

        horizontal rotation. One can zoom in or zoom out of both types of QTVR 

        movies. Also, invisible regions called hot spots can be painted anywhere 

        on QTVR movies. Hot spots trigger special actions when clicked on. They 

        may launch new Web pages, label points on an object or in a pano, or bring 

        up magnified details of an object.</p>

      <p class=normal>Both types of QTVR are used in the finished Virtual Tour. 

        The panoramas of the exhibition space serve as an interface for accessing 

        the featured objects selected by the students. Clicking on a hot spot 

        over the museum display of a featured object causes the QTVR object to 

        load in a separate web page frame accompanied by an interpretive essay 

        written by a student. Clickable floor plans of the exhibition space offer 

        another method of navigating the virtual tour and accessing the virtual 

        objects (see Figure 1)</p>

      <p class=normal>Of the three schools participating in the NMAI virtual museum 

        project, Hannahville has been the most successful in involving the local 

        community to create a local virtual museum using local resources. In a 

        three-day open house session at the school, community members brought 

        native arts, crafts, costumes and cultural items that students recorded 

        in digital photography and QTVR. Students wrote essays on the objects 

        and used digital sound recording to add their voices to annotate their 

        virtual exhibits. They used oral history techniques to record community 

        members' renditions of traditional stories for their virtual museum. 

        A year later, the school found a private museum in the region that gave 

        them full access to its collection of Anishnaabe and historical items 

        to add to their virtual museum. The museum is now an interdisciplinary 

        effort involving the school at all grade levels. A publicly accessible 

        component of the school's virtual museum activities is on the World 

        Wide Web (<a href="http://www.hvl.bia.edu)/" target="new">http://www.hvl.bia.edu)</a>.</p>

      <h1>Virtual Museum Text Labels</h1>

      <p class=normal>A closer look at one aspect of the virtual museum project 

        activities illustrates the Four Directions model in action. Students selected 

        the exhibition objects they wished to feature in the Virtual Tour. They 

        worked together in the creation of the virtual museum media, but each 

        student individually researched and wrote the interpretive essays to accompany 

        their selected items.</p>

      <p class=normal>Historically, museum curators responded to their role in 

        public education by writing and posting exhibition labels--captions 

        that accompany an exhibited artifact or artwork. Museum labels became 

        so revered that they often overshadowed the objects they described. In 

        one of the earliest texts on museology, Goode (1895) went so far as to 

        define "an efficient educational museum" as a "collection of instructive 

        labels, each illustrated by a well-selected specimen." By contrast, contemporary 

        museums now provide a forum for what Hemmings (1997) describe as the "multiplicity 

        of narratives and the contestation of knowledge claims." For indigenous 

        peoples, this approach translates to an invitation to participate in the 

        digital repatriation of cultural objects to their centers of origin and 

        an opportunity for Native voices to interpret their own cultural objects. 

        It is a form of cultural collaboration between museums and Native people.</p>

      <p class=normal>The children themselves interpreted the objects featured 

        in the virtual tour. They wrote essays which can be retrieved by clicking 

        on the thumbnail photograph of a given exhibit item. They wrote essays 

        between 60 and 240 words long in the NMAI George Gustav Heye Center's 

        Resource Center with the assistance of the project team members from the 

        Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of 

        Texas at Austin. The students reviewed information about the objects in 

        the published exhibition catalogs. They then studied the origins of the 

        object by locating the culture's geographic homeland in atlases. 

        They gathered published material in the Resource Center's reference 

        collection and consulted with the Resource Center staff, especially those 

        from cultures that created objects in the tour. They reflected on their 

        own responses to the objects and on their own cultural heritage as they 

        described the objects. In creating these essays, the children not only 

        had an opportunity to become involved in interpreting the objects but 

        they also honed their own skills in conducting library research and writing. 

        They brought their own knowledge and values to the learning activity, 

        which is the core feature of culturally responsive education.</p>

      <p class=normal>Students considered the following questions when writing 

        these essays: </p>

      <p class=normal><i>Who created this artifact?</i></p>

      <p class=normal>In his essay on a decorated birchbark box, Galvin described 

        its creators as the Micmac, also known as the Lnu'k, people who lived 

        in New England and Canada. Kara wrote about a Seneca headdress and mentioned 

        that the Seneca call themselves "The People of the Big Hill" and are part 

        of the Iroquois Confederacy.</p>

      <p class=normal><i>Where did these people live? </i></p>

      <p class=normal>Kara introduced the Haida as people who lived in Alaska 

        and on an island off the western coast of Canada. Fay placed the Kiowa-Apache 

        originally in Texas and later in Kansas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Sara 

        mentioned that the Chemehuevi, creators of a gourd depicted in the tour, 

        live in southeast California.</p>

      <p class=normal><i>What was the object's purpose? Why was it created? 

        </i></p>

      <p class=normal>Kara assumed that a rattle might be used by the Gitksan 

        as either a musical instrument or in traditional healing. Sara mentioned 

        that the Inka drank out of carved goblets during ceremonies. Marlena described 

        a quilled mask that a horse would wear in a parade. Galvin wrote that 

        Tshimshian carved a cedar box in which they would store valuables. Sara 

        noted that the hole in a Mimbres valley bowl meant that the pot was placed 

        in a grave site so that the spirit of the deceased would be released through 

        the hole. Andrea mentioned that Ponca winter shirts were painted with 

        illustrations of war exploits. They interpreted the symbols or shapes 

        of objects: the eighth star on a porcupine quill box represented Great 

        Britain and jaguars were sacred to the Inka of Peru.</p>

      <p class=normal><i>What was it created from?</i></p>

      <p class=normal>Galvin described how the Haida made bowls from sheep horn. 

        Tierra described how an Assiniboine headdress was made with thinned Antelope 

        horns and feathers fastened to a leather fringed strap. Tierra and Andrea 

        describe how Osage women altered military uniforms and top hats into wedding 

        dresses. Michelle listed the various materials used in Pomo baskets, from 

        saguaro cacti to willow shoots.</p>

      <p class=normal><i>How was it created? </i></p>

      <p class=normal>The children described how the horns of mountain sheep were 

        boiled or steamed and then shaped into bowls which were then carved. They 

        described how Native women softened and flattened porcupine quills. Galvin 

        described how his aunt, Maria Martinez, created a black-on-black plate, 

        from the gathering of the clay to firing of the pottery. Sara provided 

        a step-by-step process for creating a gourd rattle. Molly provided links 

        to web sites that sold kits or provided instructions on how to make a 

        deer hoof rattle. </p>

      <p class=normal><i>Why did I select this object for the tour? </i></p>

      <p class=normal>Kara selected a model Haida house because she thought other 

        children would like to study the animals depicted on the exterior and 

        interior of the model. Michelle chose a headdress from the Great Lakes 

        area since she lives in northern Michigan. Fay explained why she selected 

        an Ojibwe Bandolier bag: "I chose to write about this bandolier bag because 

        it must have taken a very long time, a lot of love and pride to make this 

        sort of thing</p>

      <p class=normal><i>How is this object connected or not connected to my culture? </i></p>

      <p class=normal>Galvin wrote that faces on a carved Tshimshian box reminded 

        him of skinwalkers, monsters in his own culture. In discussing a Lakota 

        turtle amulet, Marlena mentioned that her family still keeps an infant's 

        umbilical cord. Fay observed that some families are learning how to make 

        cradleboards for infants. </p>

      <p class=normal>By selecting the black pottery plate made by his aunt, Galvin 

        was &quot;digitally repatriating&quot; it to his family and community 

        back in New Mexico, an act of cultural revitalization. When writing his 

        interpretive essay on the plate, he relied primarily on his personal knowledge 

        of the unique techniques employed by Pueblo potters and the traditional 

        designs they employ:</p>

      <p class=normal>My aunt Maria Martinez made this pottery plate. She is famous 

        for her pottery work. When I was coming to New York, there was a pot that 

        she made in the airport. When she gathered the clay it was dirt. She sifted 

        the dirt to remove stones. Then she wet the clay and made a piece of art. 

        She polished the surface with round, river rocks to make the pottery shiny. 

        Then she brought the pottery outside, covered it with dry cow manure, 

        and put tin and metal sheets on top of the wood she used to fire the pottery. 

        Some black-on-black pottery has designs of kiva steps, rain clouds and 

        feathers.</p>

      <p class=normal>Kara's essay on the Seneca headdress illustrates the process 

        of cultural collaboration. Her original choice had been an Apache medicine 

        hat, but museum staff noted that the sacred nature of the object might 

        draw objections from Apache people. One staff member knew a respected 

        member of the Apache community in Arizona and called him, asking for advice. 

        He requested that the medicine hat not be featured on the virtual tour. 

        Kara selected the Seneca headdress as an alternative. When researching 

        the text label, however, she was not able to find a reference that explained 

        the headdress to her satisfaction. So she relied instead on primary sources 

        for her essay. There were two museum staff members who were Seneca whom 

        she interviewed for her essay:</p>

      <p class=normal>This is a Seneca Headdress. The Seneca lived in the northeastern 

        United States. They call themselves &quot;The People of the Big Hill&quot; 

        because they believe their ancestors emerged from a big hill. The headdress 

        is called &quot;<i>gustoweh</i>,&quot; which means &quot;real hat.&quot; 

        This <i>gustoweh</i> is made of leather with a silver band, wampum beads 

        and feathers. Rich Hill says that the feather standing up represents the 

        leader standing over chaos. The feathers lying down are the chaos. Chiefs 

        do not wear the <i>gustoweh</i>, but other men do. Stephanie Betancourte 

        says that the feather standing up is an eagle feather, and the other feathers 

        are turkey feathers. The Seneca are part of the Iroquois Confederacy, 

        and each Confederacy member arranges its headdress feathers differently. 

        Some members put one feather up, some put more than one feather up, or 

        put feathers to the side. You can tell the headdress is Seneca because 

        one feather is up.</p>

      <p class=normal>The technologies supported on the World Wide Web offer many 

        ways of expanding the function of the traditional text label. One can, 

        for instance, add links to culturally appropriate web sites, develop an 

        online dictionary/thesaurus to define terms used in the essays and to 

        refer to additional terms, provide various levels of information for different 

        audiences, incorporate text and sound files in Native language(s), incorporate 

        additional sound files, add lesson plans for educators, provide a bibliography 

        and resource list or add an interactive chat or discussion area that allows 

        virtual museum visitors to discuss objects and their meanings online. 

        In addition, community information can be added to the text. For example, 

        the results of oral history interviews with Native people could provide 

        additional detail on the history, creation, and use of various artifacts. 

      </p>

      <h1>Cultural Appropriation, Cultural Property Rights, and Levels of Accessibility</h1>

      <p class=normal>For many years, the United States policy towards Native 

        Americans encouraged assimilation. At the same time that native peoples 

        struggled with issues of basic survival, they became objects of study 

        by scholars in disciplines such as anthropology and literary criticism. 

        Native material culture became a commodity as social scientists sought 

        to salvage evidence of societies thought to be on the brink of extinction. 

        Museums that were developed to house collections of Native American art 

        and artifacts scattered cultural and historical objects far from their 

        points of origin. Objects in collections were also often interpreted and 

        presented out of context by scholars who were not tribal members. This 

        practice detached the objects from the living communities that produced 

        them.</p>

      <p class=normal>By the late 1960s, there were efforts to initiate new federal 

        policy of self-determination that would return to Indians the freedom 

        to govern and educate themselves. Indian country is establishing new economies, 

        rediscovering and revitalizing indigenous expression and participating 

        in political and social issues affecting contemporary life such as natural 

        resource management and protection of treaty rights. Native communities 

        have started to take control over physical and intellectual access to 

        their cultural objects by renovating existing museums and establishing 

        new ones. The passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation 

        Act of 1990 has increased communication between tribes and museums. NAGPRA 

        requires all museums that receive federal funds to provide Native communities 

        with written descriptions of their collections of Native American holdings. 

        It also delineates a process for the return of human remains and certain 

        objects (funerary, sacred, and those of &quot;cultural patrimony&quot;) 

        to lineal descendants or tribes. </p>

      <p class=normal>Virtual museum collaborations between Indian communities 

        and museums with Native American material can provide a venue to address 

        issues of cultural property rights and to design protocols for collaboration. 

        Open access to material must be balanced with a Native community's 

        right to control delivery of content. Even within tribes, there are varying 

        levels of access to information. Some information may be available only 

        during certain times of the year. In some traditions, for example, certain 

        stories are told only in the winter. Other information may be shared only 

        with those who meet qualifications of gender or level of expertise or 

        training. </p>

      <p class=normal>Several existing policy documents can be used to initiate 

        conversations on use of and access to cultural property. Some policies 

        guide decision making with a given Native community. The Hopi Cultural 

        Preservation Office outlines its "Protocol for Research, Publications 

        and Recordings" on its Web page (<a href="http://www.nau.edu/~hcpo-p/hcpo/index.html" target="new">http://www.nau.edu/~hcpo-p/hcpo/index.html</a>). 

        Other policy documents reflect the deliberation of a single academic community 

        or a consortium of individuals or organizations. An interdisciplinary 

        committee of faculty at Northern Arizona University provided guidance 

        to those conducting research in Native communities, reprinted in Mihesuah's 

        text (1996) , <i>American Indians: Stereotypes &amp; Realities</i>. The 

        Mataatua Declaration on Cultural and Intellectual Property Rights of Indigenous 

        Peoples (<a href="http://www.ecouncil.ac.cr/indig/legislation/english/mataatua.htm" target="new">http://www.ecouncil.ac.cr/indig/legislation/english/mataatua.htm</a>) 

        expresses the views of a congress of 150 indigenous delegates from fourteen 

        countries gathered in New Zealand in 1993. It lists recommendations to 

        indigenous peoples worldwide, to states, national, and international agencies, 

        and to the United Nations.</p>

      <p class=normal>Cultural property rights policy documents and consultation 

        with respected community members will help develop methods for cultural 

        collaboration for museums that wish to handle and exhibit Native American 

        materials responsibly. Because the Eurocentric traditions of museums have 

        been critically challenged only recently, these practices are still evolving. 

        The personal experiences of Marty Kriepe de Montaño illustrate the struggle 

        for responsible cultural collaboration from the museum perspective.</p>

      <h1>Cultural Collaboration, a Personal Story</h1>

      <p class=normal>When I first came to the Museum of the American Indian/Heye 

        Foundation, in 1983, before the Museum was part of the Smithsonian, the 

        exhibitions were interpreted from a non-Native perspective. On my first 

        day at the museum, the staff eagerly guided me to the part of the permanent 

        exhibits that featured artifacts that came from my community--the 

        Prairie Band Potawatomi of Kansas. The case was full of beautiful objects 

        and among the examples of beadwork and ribbonwork were three <i>sachkins</i>, 

        traditional cloth blouses with large cape-like collars. The <i>sachkins</i> 

        were pinned to the side of the exhibit case with the back of the blouses 

        showing. I thought, "that's interesting, they're showing the 

        back of the <i>sachkins</i>.&quot; But then, I saw another <i>sachkin</i> 

        on a mannequin and <i>it was backwards on the mannequin! </i>My first 

        thought was "have I been wearing my blouse wrong?"<i> </i>But then I realized 

        <i>they don't know what they are doing! </i>I told them of their 

        mistake, but they never did change the blouses. This oversight put me 

        in an uncomfortable position. I was always embarrassed to show this exhibit 

        to other native people, particularly Potawatomi.</p>

      <p class=normal>Museums are a potentially rich source of information about 

        Indian cultures. But they often reinforce stereotypes and devalue the 

        lifeways and experiences of the people represented by their collections. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>In 1985, when I was one of two Native Americans on the staff 

        of the Museum of the American Indian/Heye Foundation, the head of Interpretive 

        Services, who knew I was sometimes critical of the museum's labels, 

        gave me label copy from an upcoming exhibit of buffalo robes so I could 

        proofread them. </p>

      <p class=normal>When I read them I was horrified. The worst example was 

        a label that described a robe that was painted with a depiction of the 

        battle of the Little Bighorn. The label referred to the "infamous battle 

        where the Sioux and Cheyenne massacred Custer's troops." When I encountered 

        the curator, I blurted out that I thought the label was terribly ethnocentric. 

        She was genuinely surprised and asked what I meant. </p>

      <p class=normal>I told her that, in the first place, the battle was famous 

        to me because my heroes won. I said that if we are not going to present 

        the information from a Native perspective, we should at least just call 

        it a battle and be neutral. Furthermore, I said, you cannot use the word 

        massacre to describe what happened to the 7<sup>th</sup> Cavalry. The 

        cavalry was composed of paid, armed soldiers who attacked a peaceful, 

        sleeping village. The fact that the soldiers all lost their lives does 

        not mean it was a massacre. The word massacre implies innocence on the 

        part of those killed.</p>

      <p class=normal>She looked it up and discovered I was right, then asked 

        what I thought we should say. I thought a second, and then replied that 

        we could say they were "rubbed out." They did change the labels because 

        of my input. They didn't say they were rubbed out, but they did make 

        the labels neutral. </p>

      <p class=normal>In 1991, staff of the newly created National Museum of the 

        American Indian traveled throughout Indian Country to inform tribal members 

        of the new museum and to ask them how the new museum could benefit their 

        communities. At a meeting between NMAI representatives and culture bearers 

        of the Hannahville Potawatomi in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Larry 

        Matrious, an elder responded: </p>

      <p class=normal>The Chamokmon (White people) took away our heritage and 

        our things and we think they have a responsibility to us to let us use 

        the things that came from our communities to give pride and self esteem 

        to our young. Alcohol is killing us. We need some knowledge to help us 

        combat this. We'd like to go to the museum and record the things 

        and put together a video in which we interpret these things for our children.</p>

      <p class=normal>When the group was asked about the display of sensitive 

        objects in museums, Larry Matrious spoke with feeling about the exhibition 

        of sacred bundles: "they are alive, like a person. So are the pipes. It 

        is like seeing a person in a glass cage. It hurts my heart to see these 

        things held captive in museums."</p>

      <p class=normal>At a meeting at the Kickapoo Nation School in Kansas, teacher 

        Howard Allen informed museum representatives that he would like very much 

        to have visual documentation of collections that came from their community 

        to share with the students. He said they did not have much documentation 

        on things such as clothing and house styles and that they were very interested 

        in finding some way that they could share the museum's resources 

        with their students.</p>

      <p class=normal>In 1988, Mr. Milo Yellow Hair, an Oglala Lakota, who visited 

        the Museum of the American Indian/Heye Foundation, remarked in a visitor's 

        comment book that "the museum is not a ceremony about to begin! Please 

        remove the pipes of the Lakota from the stems. Separate and equal! <i><span

lang=FR>Pila ma ya yelo.</span></i>"</p>

      <p class=normal>He was referring to the fact that pipe rituals are a living 

        tradition and that followers of this tradition are instructed that pipes 

        should never be stored with the bowl attached to the stem. A pipe stem 

        should only be put together with the bowl just before it is used. This 

        is what Mr. Yellow Hair is referring to when he says the museum is not 

        a ceremony about to begin. He ends his comment by saying in Lakota, "Thank 

        you very much." </p>

      <p class=normal>Cultural bias in interpretation alienates Indian people 

        and fails to educate non-Indians. As keepers of a significant portion 

        of the material culture of Native American, museums have a responsibility 

        to Indians and non-Indians alike, to present information without ethnocentric 

        bias. To be truly informative, museums must find ways to interpret Indian 

        cultures on their own terms. As the ethnohistorian, Calvin Martin points 

        out, "to ignore the Indian thoughtworld is to continue writing about ourselves 

        to ourselves." (Martin, 1979, p. 158). </p>

      <p class=normal>Throughout the past decade the National Museum of the American 

        Indian has been developing a leadership role in cultural collaboration 

        with Native peoples. It has done this by hiring Native American staff, 

        consulting with leading Native community leaders and through its community 

        outreach programs. The museum's collaboration with the Four Directions 

        schools fits well into its existing mission and programs. The partnership 

        was such a success that the NMAI is currently planning to make similar 

        school-museum collaborations an ongoing feature of its programming.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class=normal>By meditating on our experiences in this virtual museum 

        learning project, we have proposed a Four Directions model for school-museum 

        collaboration. The model proposes that schools and museums examine such 

        projects as vehicles for cultural responsive education, cultural revitalization, 

        and cultural collaboration. These three overlapping and interacting concepts 

        illuminate the implications and potential benefits of school-museum partnerships. 

        We have examined our project from the perspective of both the education 

        professional and the museum professional and illustrated the model with 

        experiences from the Four Directions/NMAI collaboration, the history of 

        American Indian education and museums, and the recent trends in both of 

        these disciplines. Through this examination we have learned that school-museum 

        partnerships serve the needs and goals of both institutions, making schools 

        and museums natural partners for collaboration and mutual benefit.</p>

      <p class=normal>Our model has been developed in the particular context of 

        American Indian education and a museum with a world-class American Indian 

        collection. The history of the Native American experience has shown us 

        the implications of our model in high relief. We believe that the model 

        may shed considerable light upon school-museum partnerships that serve 

        other student populations and museums with different types of collections.</p>

      <p class=normal>Although cultural change is inevitable, institutions such 

        as schools and museums can moderate cultural change by seeking to preserve 

        cultural heritage. Our virtual museum project has given us particular 

        insight into this phenomenon. Central to our model is the notion of cultural 

        revitalization. We have seen Native American children and their communities 

        collaborate with museums in cultural recovery by &quot;digitally repatriating&quot; 

        to native communities objects long removed from their origins. By giving 

        native people central, authoritative roles in the project, our virtual 

        museum has provided a forum for cultural exchange as well as cultural 

        recovery. It has provided a venue for cultural collaboration that reaches 

        out to the global community through the World Wide Web.</p>
