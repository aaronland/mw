      <h1 class="abstractTitle">Abstract</h1>

      <span class="AbstractText">The emergence and power of the virtual on-line 

      medium, i.e. the World Wide Web, has created a rush of expectations. The 

      cultural, government and private sectors have hyped the need for an on-line 

      presence, especially where the web is seen as a virtual team building experience 

      that crosses geographical and other boundaries. While there can be few arguments 

      against the potential of the web to offer this experience, the question 

      of web rationale or integrity of representation has only recently come into 

      question.</span><span class="AbstractText">Lucille Bell, Content Coordinator 

      for the Haida First Nations, and Sylvia Grace Borda, Project Manager for 

      the Haida website, comment on their experiences creating, critiquing, and 

      liaising with a consortium of partners which included local museums within 

      British Columbia, Haida First Nations Tribal Council and Peoples, the Canadian 

      government and Expo Pavilion designers.</span><span class="AbstractText">In 

      particular, the speakers will outline the in-depth processes (joint decisions) 

      which developed into and allowed for an open, educational and virtual dialogue 

      across the geographical and cultural boundaries that separated the team 

      members, and the subsequent challenges of representing these boundaries 

      in a unified way (politically and artistically) to an international audience.</span><span class="AbstractText">Areas 

      for discussion will include:</span><span class="AbstractText">1) The selection 

      of a multimedia team. Haida First Nations as content developers, and anthologists/government 

      as web designers. The balance of representation, perception and views. Lucille 

      Bell will offer direct input about her experiences from a Haida First Nations' 

      perspective.</span><span class="AbstractText">2) Critiquing the web site 

      creation process. Particular emphasis will focus on the structure and dynamics 

      of the feedback mechanisms which were put in place during the various stages 

      of production.</span><span class="AbstractText">3) Web viewer engagement 

      - the organizational and web design methods selected in order to represent, 

      for example, the views of Haida First Nations in the areas of song, dance, 

      gaming, and politics. Incorporation of language and design elements for 

      a multi-lingual/multi-cultural audience.</span>

      <p class=normal><span>So begins the opening phrase of the virtual exhibition 

        " Our World -- Our Way of Life" - a virtual exhibition that presents 

        the perspectives of two diverse aboriginal communities in Canada -- 

        the Inuit and the Haida.</span><span> </span>The concepts of new media 

        and cultural representation will be discussed in the following presentation 

        in relation to the development of this virtual exhibition (<a

        and the corresponding interactive kiosk which was developed for special 

        presentation in the Canada Pavilion, at Expo2000 (Hanover, Germany). </p>

      <h1>The Background Story </h1>

      <p class=Author>Jennifer A. Baird, Project Coordinator, Canadian Heritage 

        Information Network (CHIN)</p>

      <p class=normal>It was the fall of 1997 when I had the pleasure of working 

        with Lucille Bell for the first time. Our collaboration began with the 

        exhibition <i>Haida: Spirits of the Sea </i>(<a href="http://www.chin.gc.ca/haida" target="new">www.chin.gc.ca/haida</a>)<i> 

        -- </i>an on-line product which was featured as a kiosk presentation 

        in the Canada Pavilion at Expo'98 (Lisbon, Portugal). The exhibition 

        was co-curated by Lucille Bell (Heritage Resources Officer at Old Massett 

        Village Council) and Nathalie Macfarlane (Director/Curator of the Haida 

        Gwaii Museum) and through the voice of the Haida people tells the story 

        of their relationship to the sea from the past to present, while reflecting 

        the theme of Expo'98 (<i>Oceans: A Heritage for the Future)</i>. 

        A contribution in recognition of the United Nations International Decade 

        of the World's Indigenous Peoples (1995-2004), the project was supported 

        by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) and 

        received three international awards. Based on the success of this collaboration, 

        a new virtual exhibition was initiated. </p>

      <p class=normal>It wasn't until the spring of 1999 however, that I 

        finally met Lucille in-person as work began on the on-line exhibition 

        which brings us here today: <i>Our World -- Our Way of Life</i> (<a

href="http://www.chin.gc.ca/inuit-haida" target="new"><span>www.chin.gc.ca/inuit-haida</span></a>). 

        As is often the case with the work done on <i>virtual </i>exhibitions 

        by the Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN), the collaboration 

        and the work involved is very real, however, the interactions often only 

        occur on a "virtual" basis (i.e. teleconferences, faxing, phone calls 

        and e-mail).</p>

      <h1>Objective(s) </h1>

      <p class=normal>With the financial support of the Canadian Department of 

        Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) and CHIN serving as Executive 

        Producer, the objective of this virtual exhibition was threefold. One: 

        to create an educational resource which would celebrate the similarities 

        and differences found within the indigen<span class="Normal">ous communities 

        of Canada; two: to reflect the overall themes of Expo2000,<i> Humankind-Nature-Technology,</i> 

        and the Canada Pavilion in particular, <i>The Spirit of Community</i>; 

        and, three: to provide a forum in which the communities could speak from 

        their own "voice." The path was not a new one, but one which has gained 

        considerable support over the past few years.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Initiatives such as the <i>Task Force 

        Report on Museums and First Peoples (1992)</i> which was created by the 

        Assembly of First Nations and the Canadian Museums Association resulted 

        in the publication, <i>Turning the Page: Forging New Partnerships Between 

        Museums and First Peoples</i>, which contains principles and recommendations 

        in support of the direction taken with this exhibition and its precedent. 

        Further support comes from the findings and recommendations of the Royal 

        Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1991) and their relative applicability 

        to all governmental departments.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">With these objectives in</span> mind, 

        and the receipt by DIAND of expressions of interest from both the Haida 

        and Inuit communities to participate in the project, the project was born.</p>

      <h1>Format</h1>

      <p class=normal>As previously, it was decided that the main product of the 

        collaboration would consist of an Internet presentation, complemented 

        by an interactive kiosk version to be featured in the Canada Pavilion, 

        where it would also be supported by a complementary physical exhibition. 

        In addition, each aboriginal project-partner was provided with base funding 

        to support the visit of a delegation by their community to Expo2000 and 

        coordinated activities of their choice.</p>

      <h1>The "Team"-</h1>

      <h1>The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)</h1>

      <p class=normal>Once the objectives of the project were established, DIAND 

        recognized the strength of the project and became the primary source of 

        funding for the project. As part of the current direction, DIAND actively 

        strives to pro<span class="Normal">mote the aboriginal groups of Canada 

        on both a national and international basis.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">In order to coordinate this multi-faceted 

        project<b>, the Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN)</b>, a Special 

        Operating Agency within the Department of Canadian Heritage, once again 

        reprised the role as executive producer -- one it has performed many 

        times before on similar international initiatives.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">In pursuit of its mission and the objectives 

        outlined above, the Haida and Inuit communities were contacted by CHIN 

        to develop the content of a virtual exhibition which would allow them 

        to explore and respect their differences while celebrating the commonalties 

        of their heritage.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">CHIN contacted the Heritage Resources 

        Department of the <b>Old Massett Village Council (OMVC)</b> and <b>Inuit 

        Tapirisat of Canada (ITC)</b> to provide the content for the exhibition 

        (i.e. texts, images, audio/video components, and objects for the physical 

        exhibition).</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Additionally, two multimedia companies 

        were engaged by CHIN to interpret the content provided by the aboriginal 

        partners into a meaningful website reflecting the objectives of all involved. 

        A site that would be interesting, educational, provocative and as well 

        as containing the touchstones of humanity -- heart and soul.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">To this end, Media Stop of Vancouver 

        (<a

href="http://www.media-stop.com/" target="new"><b><span>www.media-stop.com</span></b></a>) 

        was hired to work with the Haida partner and Strata360 of Montreal (<a

href="http://www.strata360.com/" target="new"><b><span>www.strata360.com</span></b></a>) 

        was hired to work with the Inuit partner in the creation of a cohesive 

        web site that reflected the diversity of their cultures while respecting 

        their shared heritage.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Additionally, eight internships were 

        assigned to the project through CHIN as a Coordinating Partner of the 

        federal Youth Employment Strategy <i>(Young Canada Works</i> program). 

        These internships allowed the aboriginal partners and the multimedia companies 

        to hire qualified graduates to </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">In addition, CHIN coordinated translation 

        services and provided general coordination, administration of the project.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Finally, it is noted with thanks that 

        the project was also supported by many individuals as well as public and 

        private sector organizations such as the Gwaii Trust Society and the Greater 

        Masset Development Corporation from Haida Gwaii, who supported OMVC directly. 

        </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">The measure of success of the final 

        product can be measured in many ways. From the collection of web stats 

        and their interpretation to watching a visitor move in rhythm to the music 

        during a visit to the kiosk presentation. The Canadian Heritage Information</span> 

        Network is pleased to have collaborated with the communities on this project 

        and proud of the resulting exhibition. </p>

      <h1>Our Audience: A Haida Perspective on Web Development</h1>

      <p class=normal>Lucille Bell, Heritage Resource Officer, Old Massett Village 

        Council's Economic Development and Heritage Resources Office, Haida 

        Gwaii</p>

      <p class=normal>There were many aspects to the Haida participation. First 

        of all, OMVC decided to again partner with the Haida Gwaii Museum at Qay'llnagaay 

        in Skidegate. Between the two Haida communities and organizations, Lucille 

        Bell and Nathalie Macfarlane accessed many resources.</p>

      <p class=normal>(NB.<b> </b>OMVC is the local government, or band council 

        for the Old Massett community in Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands), 

        British Columbia, Canada. The Heritage department is responsible for outreach 

        cultural projects for the Haida community and for the rest of the world.) 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>As content providers, Lucille and Nathalie faced the challenge 

        of meeting the Expo2000 themes, CHIN guidelines and multimedia requirements 

        from Media Stop. It was equally important to meet the Haida community's 

        needs to tell our own stories, to represent our culture from a contemporary 

        perspective and to counter stereotypes about aboriginal peoples. </p>

      <p class=normal>Lucille and Nathalie wrote the storyboards for each section, 

        which were reviewed and supported by the OMVC's Cultural Committee. 

        We took the Expo2000 themes (Humankind-Nature-Technology: The Spirit of 

        Community) and made them our own. </p>

      <p class=normal>Once the themes were defined, the Haida community was asked 

        for help. Skidegate and Old Massett residents were invited to submit photographs, 

        and to sing Haida songs or provide information in the Haida language. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>Haida art is renowned throughout the world and inegral to 

        our culture and livelihood. We were able to tell Haida stories and link 

        them to images of historic and contemporary beautiful pieces of work by 

        Haida artists. </p>

      <p class=normal>From our experience visiting Expo'98 and visiting other 

        Internet sites, we wanted to ensure that children were a part of our audience. 

        To do this, we selected large and attractive images, and recommended that 

        Media Stop keep the information fun and interactive. Another way to tap 

        into the children's audience was to keep the text simple and short. 

        The First Story is an interactive children's story paralleled with 

        a contemporary totem pole raising. The Haida Games section and the interactive 

        Haida language lesson were also geared towards children. </p>

      <p class=normal>The Repatriation Story met the "challenges" theme. The story 

        is based on a contemporary community effort to repatriate over 300 Haida 

        human remains from museums around the world. Telling this story was important 

        to the Haida community who believe that our audiences could learn from 

        this injustice and help be a part of the solution for many aboriginal 

        groups. </p>

      <h1>Offshoots from the Project</h1>

      <p class=normal>The project included more than creating a website and kiosk 

        for Expo. Both Media Stop and Old Massett Village Council received funding 

        to employ and train four youths. OMVC hired a Technical Intern to digitize 

        images and ensure that we submitted our materials to Media Stop in a manner 

        that they could work with. The International Intern worked on all aspects 

        of the project and also had the chance to go to Germany to visit Expo, 

        and to promote the project. The Haida Gwaii Museum's International 

        Intern helped on the project and spent a month in USA. This year, with 

        the support of Young Canada Works, we have another Intern to promote the 

        exhibit.</p>

      <p class=normal>Besides the kiosk at Expo, the project partners decided 

        to display Haida and Inuit artifacts. CHIN selected a curator for this 

        aspect. OMVC decided to select objects from the community instead of from 

        museum collections. Eight people loaned their beautiful works of art to 

        display in the Canada Pavilion for the duration of Expo. (Art works exhibited 

        during the World's Fair can be viewed on-line at <a href="http://susan.chin.gc.ca/Exhibitions/Inuit_Haida/credits.html">http://susan.chin.gc.ca/Exhibitions/Inuit_Haida/credits.html</a>) 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>Project partners decided that a monumental piece of artwork 

        would make a great impression and draw people to our kiosk. With the financial 

        support of local organizations, OMVC commissioned a totem pole to be carved. 

        The totem pole ties in with the Repatriation story in the website because 

        it represents the Haida clans and the butterfly extensions will represent 

        the Haida ancestral remains that may never return to Haida Gwaii. The 

        "Migration Home" pole will be raised in Old Massett this year.</p>

      <p class=normal>Before the Canada Pavilion opened, the Haida were invited 

        to send two representatives to a press conference when the pole was raised 

        in the pavilion. Lucille and an intern traveled to Germany to celebrate 

        the pole raising.</p>

      <p class=normal>It is Haida tradition to celebrate our successes with song 

        and dance. Following this tradition, a group of six Haidas, including 

        the carver of the pole, two elders and other project partners went to 

        Expo to share our songs and dances. The three-week visit to Germany included 

        a weeklong visit to Expo2000 and visits to German museums holding historic 

        Haida collections.</p>

      <p class=normal>Towards the completion of the website, the project partners 

        created a promotional bookmark. These were distributed at Expo, and each 

        project partner continues to distribute them. This has been a great resource 

        to OMVC, who is continuously asked by non-Haida teachers, students and 

        researchers for information on the Haida.</p>

      <h1>Challenges</h1>

      <p class=normal>The biggest challenge was the distance between the project 

        partners who were scattered throughout Canada. The partners met together 

        only once. In a sense, this project was "virtual" in communication. </p>

      <p class=normal>A challenge all partners faced was finding the funds for 

        all aspects of the projects. </p>

      <p class=normal>Another challenge we all faced was to make the product flow 

        as if it was compiled by a small group of people rather than by two content 

        providers and two media companies from the opposite ends of Canada.</p>

      <p class=normal>For the Haida partners, there were a few challenges. Our 

        first challenge was to interpret the Expo themes and make them our own. 

        Since the storyboards had to be approved by the OMVC Cultural Committee 

        and CHIN, we had to ensure they were happy with the style, content and 

        message that we were presenting.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Internet capabilities on Haida Gwaii are limited; therefore 

        we constantly had to play "catch-up" with the off-island partners.</p>

      <p class=normal>The last challenge the Haida team faced was our desire to 

        represent ourselves beyond the World Wide Web. We had to obtain an invitation 

        and then the funds to send a delegation to Expo. We took on extra work 

        to ensure that the objects collected for the pavilion represented us well 

        and we fundraised to have a totem pole commissioned.</p>

      <h1>Bridging Worlds: A New Media Producer's Perspective, </h1>

      <p class=normal><span class="Author">Sylvia Grace Borda, Media-Stop, Vancouver, 

        BC</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Interestingly, the concept and structure 

        of the "Our World -- Our Way of Life" website was oddly similar to 

        a project initiated by the German born anthropologist Franz Boas, Collections 

        Manager at the Field Museum of Natural History, 1892-1896 and a main intellectual 

        force behind the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. Boas stated "the main object 

        of ethnological collections should be the dissemination of the fact that 

        civilization is not something absolute, but that it is relative, and that 

        our ideas and conceptions are true only as so far as civilization goes" 

        (Jacknis 1985). Indeed this concept became an underlying concern for myself 

        as a media producer to profile the Haida in contemporaneous terms relative 

        to time, place and circumstance. </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">As part of his management of the anthropological 

        collections for the 1893 World's Fair, Boas included "life gro</span>ups' 

        or living dioramas of Inuit and Nuuchanulth peoples. Sadly these people 

        became public curiosities and by the close of the Chicago World's 

        Fair, the understanding of a culture through this contextualization came 

        at a heavy price for the native participants. Both the Nuuchanulth and 

        Inuit peoples died shortly after the fair due to poor living conditions 

        and constant public exposure. Lucille and I joked, how a century later 

        such interests hadn't changed. "Our World -- Our Way of Life" 

        was created for a World's Fair and profiled a Northwest First Nations 

        community and featured Inuit peoples in order to disseminate information 

        about contemporary cultures except this time, the materials were being 

        presented by aboriginal voices. </p>

      <p class=normal>From a cultural studies perspective and a related parallel, 

        Cantwell notes "that 'trade' implies the crossing of frontiers and demands 

        the creation of special zones outside the contexts of family and community 

        in which people otherwise insulated from one another may come together 

        for exchange (or in this case the movement of people across the internet). 

        Typically the marketplace occurs at the crossing points between two worlds.&quot; 

      </p>

      <h1>At cross-roads</h1>

      <p class=normal>It is this crossing point between two worlds that best describes 

        the intent behind the 'Our World -- Our Way of Life' project. In this 

        crossing, however, there is also an inherent delicacy in the world of 

        the web and cultural representation. The interpretation of material on-line 

        is often without a fixed point of reference and the reader becomes lost 

        between different allegorical poles. In the remaining part of my presentation, 

        I will discuss how I utilised new media methodologies to preserve both 

        meaning and visual integrity and how I adopted strategies to complement 

        and offset interpretive imbalances.</p>

      <p class=normal>Firstly, I must re-iterate that all the content hosted on 

        the Haida portion of "Our World- Our Way of Life" website (<a

href="http://www.chin.gc.ca/inuit-haida" target="new"><span>www.chin.gc.ca/inuit-haida</span></a>) 

        were provided by Haida colleagues, belong to the Haida community, and 

        are owned (copyrighted) by Haida. I am also grateful to the Haida and 

        the Canadian Heritage Information Network (<a href="http://www.chingc.ca/" target="new"><span>www.chin.gc.ca</span></a>) 

        for agreeing to speak about this collaborative endeavour so openly.</p>

      <p class=normal>The working parameters of the project were well defined 

        by Canadian Heritage Information Network in association with Haida partners-- 

        minimum standards were set to accommodate low end users. For example, 

        no web page should have any potential rate of failure with Browers 3.0 

        and up; fast loadability, and page alignment should accommodate users 

        with 800 x 600 pixel wide screens. </p>

      <p class=normal>All of the Haida webpage layout is set to be both minimized 

        and expandable, thus allowing users the possibility of accessing the information 

        irregardless of screen size. Further to these factors the versatility 

        of the website design was stressed to be both readable on Internet Explorer 

        and Netscape; and additionally to be compatible on Mac and PC platforms.</p>

      <p class=normal><span>Other design factors which guided the development 

        of the Haida website project were related directly to the end venue, The 

        World's Fair. For every World's Exposition there is a set of 

        themes that Pavilion organizer's must adhere to. Out of the ten possible 

        themes available to Expo2000, Canadian fair organizers selected to focus 

        on economic sustainability, renewable resources and water to be the main 

        themes for the Canadian Pavilion and participant groups. In the development 

        of the Haida website, Haida First Nations define sustainability to include 

        both economic and cultural resources as illustrated by stories, dance, 

        song, and repatriation activities amongst other events.</span></p>

      <p class=normal>The uniqueness of working on the project stems from its 

        multi-tier levels. Firstly -- Old Massett Village Council's Economic 

        Development and Heritage Resources Office (OMVC) had both a different 

        dynamic and direction than a museum -- its resources are its own peoples 

        and community. Objects, stories, dance and song from community members 

        formed the curatorial content. At a second level, Haida had full control 

        of content arrangement in the new media design. In managing the new media 

        design of the Haida "Our World -- Our Way of Life" website, I worked 

        collaboratively under the direction of the Haida-- particularly with 

        OMVC in the Queen Charlotte Islands or, otherwise known by their native 

        name, Haida Gwaii. </p>

      <p class=normal>As the new media manager of the Haida content, I was responsible 

        to review and access materials for the development of the "Our World- 

        Our Way of Life" website and kiosk interactives. From a project management 

        perspective, the work accomplished by Haida and Media-stop, I am pleased 

        to say, appears seamless in its layout despite the fact that we worked 

        virtually, producing a product for a virtual environment!</p>

      <p class=normal>Hadia Gwaii is about 700 km away from Vancouver -- and 

        accessible by a land ferry at Prince Rupert or by flight carriers from 

        Vancouver. The cost of travel to and from Haida Gwaii to Vancouver can 

        be as high as $700 Canadian, and availability is not always guaranteed 

        due to adverse storms that can plague the islands especially during the 

        autumn and winter months. For nearly four months -- I only knew my 

        Northwest partners by their voices on the telephone. Of course, when we 

        finally met we all roared with laughter -- it was thought that I was 

        a tall blonde.</p>

      <p class=normal>Lucille Bell and Nathalie Macfarlane were responsible for 

        the forwarding of texts and a library of images for page layout on an 

        on-going basis throughout the media development of the website. All content 

        materials from the Haida colleagues arrived at Media-stop via post, couriers, 

        faxes, and/or by the Haida community travelling to and from Haida Gwaii. 

        Content layout was discussed at length via telephone conference calls 

        and by an electronic discussion list which were supported by CHIN. We 

        also exchanged storyboards, faxed each other QuarkXpress documents, and 

        importantly used the web as a staging post for the various production 

        stages of the project and mounted numerous draft web pages. </p>

      <p class=normal>The final version of the site was quite extensive and will 

        be mentioned here in brief, before the finer details of the site are discussed. 

        Due to the resulting size of the site and in order to stream users effectively, 

        it was decided that the website be arranged using a two page entry gateway. 

        The main entry page (<a href="http://www.chin.gc.ca/inuit-haida" target="new">http://www.chin.gc.ca/inuit-haida</a>) 

        allows users to make a language choice. The splash page introduces the 

        title in three languages with words of welcome in each respective language 

        to encourage users to move the mouse towards the hotlinked text -- 

        German (the language of the Expo host country), French and English (the 

        two official languages of Canada) are included. </p>

      <p class=normal>Once a title or language group has been selected, the viewer 

        enters a second page which lists the names of the two aboriginal communities 

        represented. Here the user can explore an interactive map highlighting 

        the geographical location of the two groups, Haida and Inuit. The page 

        is also framed at the base with a statement describing the purpose of 

        the virtual exhibition. </p>

      <p class=normal>When the Haida drop-down selection menu is activated from 

        the map or second entry level page -- the viewer moves directly into 

        the content/descriptive rich pages. In total, the English version of the 

        Haida content represents well over 80 web pages. To accommodate the amount 

        of materials to be presented on the website under the sustainability and 

        water related themes, Haida partners divided the content into additional 

        themed sections. </p>

      <p class=normal>These sections became the labels or tags that divide the 

        content navigational bar. Within each thematic section, sub-topics of 

        information also reside. These sub-topics become the foundation to a secondary 

        navigational system, allowing the viewer the possibility to skip to other 

        areas of interest within a given topic without losing the continuity of 

        the information and/or having to advance page by page to materials. </p>

      <p class=normal>The use of a frameset permits the user to access information 

        much more quickly than toggling between the second entry page and content 

        related sections. Likewise, the incorporation of a frameset to hold the 

        main navigation maintains both visual continuity throughout the site, 

        as well as ensuring fast loading since the images are already held in 

        a cache from page to page. </p>

      <p class=normal>In building a Haida presence on the web, the ability of 

        non-Haida viewers to interact and engage with the on-line materials was 

        a design imperative. Small details became the signature of the website; 

        whereas, Haida content directed the design of the website, creative solutions 

        gave it a 'soul'. </p>

      <p class=normal>Some examples are provided below. For instance, texts were 

        written using a first person narrative and included references to Haida 

        names. Given my own criteria to enable a large audience to access and 

        interpret the information, I decided all Haida terms would be highlighted 

        differently from the main body text; thereby, establishing a visual continuity 

        throughout the site, as well as adding emphasis to these terms.<span></span></p>

      <p class=normal>With the segmentation of each topical section into self- 

        contained pages, it was necessary to create additional pagination which 

        incorporated navigational arrows to accommodate these new pages. To personify 

        or 'brand' the site, as being Haida, Haida hands were used as navigational 

        guides which allow viewers to move back and forward through the content. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>It was also decided to make use of roll-overs which could 

        provide viewers the opportunity to see details and/or alternate views/functions 

        of objects and/or depicted scenes. This functional element was effectively 

        used in the Art section, for example, to show a transformation mask which 

        the user can literally 'transform' with a move of the cursor over the 

        image. The roll-over action emulates the operation of the mask, and thus 

        remains more true to its on-line interpretation than the placement of 

        two images side by side.</p>

      <p class=normal> ( see page 3/ 3 of Art: <i>What is Haida Art?</i> </p>

      <p class=normal><a

href="http://susan.chin.gc.ca/Exhibitions/Inuit_Haida/haida/english/art/index.html"><span>http://susan.chin.gc.ca/Exhibitions/Inuit_Haida/haida/english/art/index.html</span></a> 

        )</p>

      <p class=normal>The functionality of the rollovers further produced an added 

        value product in terms of accessibility. These interactive images were 

        created as 'gifs' and the file size, therefore, was kept small for quicker 

        uploading, and copyright infringements had been removed with the use of 

        low resolutions. Each set of images displayed on the main content pages 

        was complemented by an image gallery. The image gallery contained the 

        full captions and other related data so that the user could drill down 

        for more information. The gallery also prevented the main content page 

        from being cluttered from excessive text. </p>

      <p class=normal>Historical slide lantern images incorporated in the Fishing 

        section were hand-colored to mimic hand-tinted photographs and postcards 

        of the time and to be more distinctive from the main design elements. 

        To maintain the integrity of the original visual images, these altered 

        scenes are presented in round portals -- paralleling the theme's 

        section: fishing and at sea. Hand-colored images are linked to gallery 

        pages where full archive descriptions of the unaltered image and catalogue 

        numbers can be referred to by the viewer. </p>

      <p class=normal>(see <a href="http://susan.chin.gc.ca/Exhibitions/Inuit_Haida/haida/english/sea/gallery1.html">http://susan.chin.gc.ca/Exhibitions/Inuit_Haida/haida/english/sea/gallery1.html</a>)</p>

      <p class=normal>To contextualize content rich pages, frame based windows 

        where a viewer can scroll across an enlarged image were incorporated. 

        In Raven and the First Men -- an origins story unfolds. The story 

        mentions local Haida Gwaii locales, and provides quotes from Haida artist, 

        Bill Reid who translated the origins story into an impressive Cedar sculpture. 

        Both a Haida map and Reid's 'First Men and Raven' sculpture 

        are self-contained on the content page as scrollable boxes. Users can 

        move horizontally and vertically within the frame to see details of Haida 

        Gwaii and/or view-up close the workmanship of Reid's sculpture. Again 

        this frameset, like the zoomable roll-overs, permits the user to learn 

        and absorb Haida culture in a more intimate manner and literally lets 

        the story move like a narrative. </p>

      <p class=normal>Haida contemporary culture is best embodied in the Repatriation 

        and Oral culture sections of the website. Quite contrary to a Western 

        perspective and definition of repatriation in relationship to the material 

        world-- this section focuses on community, elders, and people rather 

        than on objects. Lucille had contributed more images for this section 

        than any other -- and from reviewing the pictures -- it became 

        clear that repatriation, like the accompanying text, is about family. 

        For a media designer, where image quality and focus are central -- 

        I gained a new appreciation of the importance of keeping the layout simple 

        when the content itself should guide the viewer. With this in mind, the 

        arrangement of the section was kept quite linear and the images were arranged 

        to evoke a family album or scrapbook.</p>

      <p class=normal>A different experience awaits the web visitor in The Oral 

        culture section which includes the Haida calendar, and a children's 

        story, The First Totem Pole. The calendar is designed like an ethnographer's 

        table. Framed above the table in a cameo photograph is an elder Haida 

        woman, Mary Swanson, who is also the narrator and voice of the Haida calendar 

        months. </p>

      <p class=normal>A Haida visual motif with an adjacent 'sound' icon denotes 

        the hot-spot where a sound clip can be accessed. From a media perspective, 

        editing the sound clip, maintaining the vocal quality, removing background 

        sounds, and producing a quick uploading and universally accessible sound 

        clip made this section a challenge but a phenomenal addition. To hear 

        a cultural language -- makes that culture much more real to the visitor. 

        In this way it was hoped that certain interactive elements would enable 

        a user's visit to be more innovative than that experienced simply 

        by reading about a cultural group.</p>

      <p class=normal>The First Totem Story is illustrated with Haida drawings 

        and is complemented by photographic images which follow the real-life 

        raising of a totem pole. Thus the two sets of images work in parallel 

        as the story unfolds from the past accompanied by a story of the here 

        and now. For added visual effect, I utilised an image of a Haida raven 

        to 'fly' across the screen and to guide the reader through the 

        passage of the story narrative to the 'present' day. </p>

      <p class=normal>In several aspects this dual representation of the past 

        and present encapsulates the dichotomy of cultural representation on the 

        web. Such representation is either shown as a past or a contemporary allegory 

        and usually without any point of reference. The ability for the viewer 

        to scroll horizontally across the screen was utilised in the same way 

        that museum exhibition designers use 'the hide and seek' methods 

        to display objects. The images held off screen advance the story and give 

        an anticipation as to what might follow, allowing the imagination to try 

        and second guess what will indeed unfold in the story narrative.</p>

      <p class=normal>From my experience on the project and from a new media perspective, 

        I believe cultural representation is largely tied in with 'voice' 

        and the content, above all, should encapsulate this voice. Content should 

        also be equal to the design in facilitating the project. This refers to 

        an essential need for an infusion of new methodologies to produce media 

        sites by keeping an open and sustained dialogue with content providers 

        and by maintaining an observational and instinctive approach.</p>

      <p class=normal>Lastly the structural considerations of a website are the 

        foundations in the formation of a dynamic and functional website. New 

        media should form a complement and a means by which the content like its 

        own creation guides the visitor into a unique ways of investigation and 

        learning. In fact, the challenges are far greater than one would imagine 

        to address this balance because it is easy for a media producer to be 

        lead by the technology and design 'flash' in the hope of capturing 

        the attention of the visitor, however brief. </p>

      <h1>In conclusion: The benefits - New Approaches Learned</h1>

      <p class=normal>Museum and cultural websites should always be questioned 

        in relationship to their production and methodologies with 'why this 

        approach,' 'what are the benefits,' and "for whom does 

        this address and for which audiences". Electronic media displays must 

        preserve the economy or the inherent integrity behind each visual and 

        each concept. Without content and design integrity resulting materials 

        placed on the web float like a designer label or banner ad.</p>

      <p class=normal>We believe the rewards in media design and content provision 

        are equal to the challenges for sponsors, content providers, media producers 

        and visitor audiences in developing a site that endeavours to remain 'true' 

        to its voice and subject. We hope that the website 'Our World -- 

        Our Way of Life' will prove to be a model of excellence, particularly 

        in the areas of collaboration and communication without which the site 

        would not have been made possible. Our many thanks to all who have graciously 

        donated their time, feedback, and energies in making this endeavour and 

        presentation feasible. </p>
