      <p class=PaperTitle>"Beyond museum walls" -- A critical analysis of 

        emerging approaches to museum web-based education</p>

      <p class=Author>Kevin Sumption, Powerhouse Museum, Australian Museums On 

        Line, Australia</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span class="AbstractText">&quot;An effective educational 

        museum might be described as a collection of labels bearing instructions, 

        each of them illustrated by a carefully selected specimen.&quot; George 

        Brown Goode, Assistant Secretary at the Smithsonian, 1896 (Alexander, 

        1979). </span></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span class="AbstractText">Although Goode's assertion 

        may look naive by contemporary pedagogical and museological standards, 

        I'm sure many of us wish that the process of museum education were 

        indeed that easy. However, we know that such assertions are anathema, 

        as both the primacy of the object and our understanding of learning have 

        advanced considerably in the last 100 years. Since the arrival of photography 

        in the mid nineteenth century, the interpretive pre-eminence of artefacts 

        has been steadily eroded by a succession of media. More recently, interactive 

        multimedia (IMM) have penetrated homes as well as museums, transforming 

        visitor expectations as well as the way modern museums approach education.</span></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span class="AbstractText">The most ubiquitous of contemporary 

        IMM, the Internet, is making steady progress as an interpretive tool within 

        museums. However, its major impact is being felt beyond museum walls. 

        As an outreach agent, the Internet has captivated many museums and particularly 

        their educators. As a communication medium, the Internet allows museum 

        educators to enter the homes and schools of students without their ever 

        needing to visit the museum. So it's not surprising that some museum 

        education products try to simulate the spatial and social experience of 

        visiting a museum. However, this approach is just one of many resource 

        "types" educators have deployed as they grapple with the promise and reality 

        of on-line education. </span></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote><span class="AbstractText">As part of the research team 

        developing Australian Museums On Line's new Education Gateway, I 

        have spent considerable time examining why and how museums are using the 

        Internet for education outreach. In this paper I will explore these, as 

        well as the diversity of emerging on-line education expressions. I will 

        also review current research into the unique interface, navigation and 

        content preferences of various learners and, just as important, discuss 

        best practice teaching and learning strategies to help museum educators 

        develop more effective on-line educational resources. </span></p>

        learning, Creative play</p>

      <p class=normal>For all but eight of its first 100 years, my museum - the 

        Powerhouse Museum - was part of the New South Wales Department of Education. 

        Not surprisingly, then, interest in the use of objects in teaching here 

        has a long history, dating back to the 1890s, and still remains a critical 

        component of Powerhouse Museum education practice. However, in the last 

        100 years our understanding of the complex interplay between visitors 

        and objects that gives rise to learning has changed as epistemological 

        and pedagogical research has evolved. From this, a number of educational 

        theories have developed to explain how learning in object-orientated environments 

        such as museums can take place. Today the direct-experience model is the 

        one widely accepted, particularly in science and technology museums. </p>

      <h1>Direct-Experience Learning</h1>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Direct-experience-based learning divides 

        our world into two distinct realms: the physical world where objects exist 

        and events happen, and our minds which are capable of memory and conscious 

        thought. By allowing visitors to encounter<i> real </i>objects, labels 

        and a variety of media, we immerse them in a physical world where they 

        see, hear, touch, taste, smell and do. It is human nature that visitors 

        should then seek to understand these 'direct-experiences.' This means 

        they must use their minds to find regularities and relationships between 

        these new primary experiences and existing concepts and principles. In 

        turn, these experiences help visitors develop a range of skills from observation 

        and reporting to deduction. </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">However, the direct-experience learning 

        model has limitations. First, the reader (visitor) must be sufficiently 

        stimulated by artefactual encounters to want to engage cognitively with 

        them. This is a problem for information technology objects such as microchips 

        and personal computers, whose form is often uninspiring or masks function 

        (Sumption, 1999). Critically, for contemporary museums, the direct-experience 

        learning model is also restricted to the <i>real </i>museum. The moment 

        we move beyond museum walls and into the realm of photo-mechanical and 

        electronic outreach, where the reality of the object is supplanted by 

        a mediated reality, the fundamental dynamic of the learning experience 

        is changed.</span></p>

      <h1>The Outreach Revolution</h1>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">As with education, outreach has been 

        an integral part of many museums' core business. As early as 1891, 

        my own museum opened its fifth satellite campus on the grounds of the 

        Broken Hill Technical Education College. The Broken Hill branch was established 

        to encourage the use of Australian products and Australian materials in 

        the manufacture of articles for everyday use. To achieve this, Broken 

        Hill was supplied with a series of taxonomic displays, all carefully selected 

        and labelled by the central museum's staff. These were then dispatched, 

        complete with hand-crafted cabinets and 2000 objects, to the remote and 

        inhospitable plains of North Western New South Wales. </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">In the late Nineteenth Century, the 

        limitations of communication media, combined with the uniqueness of the 

        museum concept, meant that nothing less than a complete reproduction<i> 

        </i>of an exhibit would have sufficed for outreach. But by the turn of 

        the century, photography, and the process of its mass-dissemination - 

        photogravure, had opened up new outreach opportunities and challenges. 

        </span></p>

      <h1>Why Use Digital Objects?</h1>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Like contemporary travelling exhibitions, 

        the painstaking reproduction of displays such as those used in Broken 

        Hill ensure that museum educators and curators retain authorial control 

        over exhibition content. However, the process of historical production, 

        via print and film, is more problematic. As photography and printing physically 

        supplant the reality of the object with a new mediated reality, curator 

        or educator control is diminished by a set of intermediary authors - the 

        camera, the lens, the film, the photographer and the designer. Also, in 

        the late 1990s, when photo-mechanical outreach was itself transformed 

        through digitisation, a further intermediary author was added. Through 

        interactive digital outreach media, even the reader has become a powerful 

        intermediary author. Nowhere is this more evident than in the latest generation 

        of active learning resources now appearing on museum websites. </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Since the privatisation of the Internet 

        here in Australia in 1995, museums have increasingly sought to use the 

        web to service the learning needs of predominantly secondary school students. 

        To do so they have harnessed the computational power of modern personal 

        computers via the World Wide Web to create a plethora of learning environments. 

        Critically, these environments have tried to attract and hold students 

        by supplanting the inherent pedagogically weak 'digital object' 

        with more engaging interactive experiences. As was evident in the first 

        generation of museum web pages, the process of 'object digitisation' 

        can potentially strip artefacts of critical signifiers such as scale, 

        weight, colour and texture. Without these material signifiers, the digital 

        object is distorted in ways that can have a qualitative impact on learning. 

        Therefore it is not surprising that more recently museums have enhanced, 

        or even supplanted 'digital objects' with interactive multimedia 

        affordances such as Java applets, streaming video and IRC, etc. As I will 

        show, this shift has had a liberating effect on many museum educators 

        who can now concentrate on the development of educational products centred 

        not just on the objects, but on the students themselves.</span></p>

      <h1>Six 'Active Learning' Typologies</h1>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">For evidence of this shift, look no 

        further than the education winners of the Best of the Web. In 1998 the 

        <i>Odyssey</i> </span><span class="Normal">website (<a href="http://www.cc.emory.edu/CARLOS/ODYSSEY/index.html" target="new">http://www.cc.emory.edu/CARLOS/ODYSSEY/index.html</a>), 

        </span><span class="Normal">utilised museum object images and stories 

        to 'inform' students of the daily life of Middle Eastern and 

        sub-Saharan peoples. In 2000, the Puppets Action website, (<a href="http://www.childrensmuseum.org/artsworkshop/puppetshow.html" target="new">http://www.childrensmuseum.org/artsworkshop/puppetshow.html</a>) 

        equipped students with tools to 'create' their own on-line puppet 

        show. This shift from seeing the web as an information medium to seeing 

        it as an active learning environment has consolidated. Now more than ever, 

        many museums are creating web-based learning environments where users, 

        not educators, are empowered to make decisions about the tasks, content, 

        navigation, presentation and assessment activities they undertake. Thus 

        a range of active learning web typologies has started to emerge. These 

        typologies range from mature <i>education meta-center </i>product<i>s,</i> 

        which continue to utilise digital object images and records, through to 

        immature expository resources, which have only tentatively embraced the 

        active learning philosophy. What distinguishes one typology from the next 

        is not just content and enabling technology, but also the cognitive strategies 

        each employs. These are the generative, problem-based, creative play and 

        expository methodologies that help learners to build on their own knowledge 

        structures (schema) to construct new knowledge and understanding. These 

        schema are consciously, and sometimes unconsciously, deployed by designers 

        and educators with varying success. So by offering the following typological 

        overview, I hope to provide a snapshot of current thinking and practice. 

        In turn, I hope this will help museum educators understand the complexities, 

        pitfalls and challenges of creating 'active learning' web resources 

        for museums.</span></p>

      <h1>1. Education Meta-centers</h1>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Of the six museum education typologies 

        I have identified, <i>Education meta-centres</i>, along <i>with Creative 

        play resources, </i>are still primarily concerned with teaching and learning 

        via museum objects and documents. However, as we shall see, best practice 

        in both is now exemplified by activities which enable users to manipulate 

        and interrogate both the physical and intellectual content of artefacts.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal"><i>Education meta-centres</i> are web-based 

        resources that allow students to explore, investigate, compare and evaluate 

        textual and pictorial information from museum collections and archives. 

        Most utilise Online Public Access Catalogues (OPAC) to make museum information 

        accessible via the web. However, the mere accessibility of such data doesn't 

        in itself guarantee learning. Therefore, many developers of data-rich 

        resources, such as the Museum of Victoria's <i>Butterfly</i> site 

        (<a href="http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/bioinformatics/butter/" target="new">http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/bioinformatics/butter/</a>), 

        have adopted generative learning methods to help students convert raw 

        data into useful knowledge products. </span></p>

      <h2>Supporting generative learning</h2>

      <p class=Normal>Museum Victoria's <i>Butterfly</i> site allows middle 

        and upper high school students to access a single database of 30,000 Victorian 

        butterfly records via seven discrete searches. Each search is designed 

        for students of a particular age and studying a particular syllabus, and 

        culminates in a series of comparative activities that allow students to 

        mentally experiment (generate ideas) with various data sets. Student experimentation 

        and analysis is via a series of web-based mapping tools. These allow them 

        to plot and overlay the distribution data of butterfly species with Victoria's 

        vegetation, altitude, river and zoogeographic information. The result 

        is a unique schematic of species and topological data which students can 

        endlessly modify and interrogate. This allows them to develop learning 

        outcomes built around their own interests, and in turn can result in deeper 

        conceptual understanding and affinity with the subject.</p>

      <h1>2. Creative Play Resources</h1>

      <p class=Normal>Like nearly all active learning resources, <i>education 

        meta-centers </i>are primarily designed for secondary and tertiary students. 

        Currently there are few museums developing active learning resources for 

        under eights. This is surprising as most museum educators agree that young 

        children have just as much right to make sense of their world with digital 

        media as do older children. Although small in number, there are a few 

        examples of what I call <i>Creative play resources</i> for under eights. 

        The Museum of Modern Arts' <i>Art Safari</i> (artsafari.moma.org/) 

        is exemplary. <i>Art Safari</i> uses paintings and sculpture from MOMA's 

        collection to help children develop their observational skills. The site 

        includes creative activities which encourage students to examine and creatively 

        respond to the forms, stories and characters in Rousseau, Kahlo, Rivera 

        and Picasso artworks. </p>

      <h2>Playing to learn</h2>

      <p class=normal>Early childhood learning research points to the value of 

        activities which stimulate and support creative play. Creative play is 

        an important part of young children's learning and describes those 

        experiences that encourage them to explore and test ideas through the 

        process of making. Most project-based websites offer some degree of creative 

        play if they allow students to create original written or oral compositions. 

        However, for young children, drawing and painting-based activities are 

        often the most effective. <i>Art Safari</i> supports this kind of creative 

        play by helping children draw a portrait of a pet or a fantastic animal 

        using a downloadable digital palette. Ordinarily, young children find 

        this kind of activity very stimulating, particularly as it allows them 

        to explore subjects that are close to their hearts. Pets, parents, brothers 

        and sisters, etc., are all of deep personal interest to young children. 

        These subjects, when combined with creative play, excite children to keep 

        on investigating, listening, talking, designing, constructing, asking 

        questions, reading and writing. (<strong>Downes, et al, 1999).</strong></p>

      <h1>3. Electronic Field Trips</h1>

      <p class=Normal>While <i>Creative play resources</i> are ideal for helping 

        develop observational and hand- eye coordination skills, <i>Electronic 

        field trips</i> are best suited for teaching complex cyclic, structural 

        or relational concepts by immersing students in credible microworlds. 

        Credible microworlds convincingly 'transport' students through 

        time to historical sites; through space to the museum; or through their 

        imagination to fictitious and fantastic worlds. The effectiveness of this 

        transportation is in part dependent on audio-visual materials and interactive 

        technologies to 'realistically' simulate an experience or environment. 

        Be they imaginary planets, tropical rainforest or civil war battlefields, 

        all these microworlds must not only capture the attention of students, 

        but also engage them in stimulating activities for long periods of time. 

        To achieve this, many <i>electronic field trips</i> utilise anchored instruction 

        techniques.</p>

      <h2>Anchored instruction</h2>

      <p class=Normal>Anchored instruction activities utilise sets of interconnected 

        problems to encourage users to activate their reasoning, deductive and 

        investigative faculties. An excellent example is Brookfield Zoo's<i> 

        Go Wild</i> field trip (<a

href="http://www.brookfieldzoo.org/" target="new">http://www.brookfieldzoo.org</a>). 

        <i>Go Wild</i> challenges students to solve the problem of finding a safe 

        way through the Ituri forest of central Africa. To help, developers have 

        provided four avatar guides who drive the narrative by bombarding users 

        with questions. As with all anchored instruction activities, <i>Go Wild 

        </i>challenges are based on <i>real</i> problems like using a compass 

        and map, making barkcloth or choosing suitable forest foods to eat. The 

        realistic nature of these problems is imperative to encourage students 

        to take ownership of their dilemma, and in turn, responsibility for actively 

        overcoming it. </p>

      <h1>4. Video Conferencing </h1>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Like <i>electronic field trips</i>, 

        video conferencing activities utilise the connectivity of the web to transport 

        students and teachers beyond their classroom or home. However, unlike 

        current <i>electronic field trips</i>, video conferencing can utilise 

        synchronous affordance technologies to connect students and teachers to 

        the <i>real</i> museum's staff and exhibits, in real time. Here the 

        microworlds created are not simulated, but utilise the performances and 

        'scenery' of staff and exhibits. Ultimately it is the photogenic 

        nature of these displays, together with the affability and open-endedness 

        of the student-presenter dialogue, which can determine the level of meaningful 

        engagement.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Unfortunately video conferencing is 

        bandwidth hungry. Therefore, museums need ideally to have access to high-speed 

        networks like that of the New Jersey Department of Education's Distance 

        Learning Network. This state-wide ISDN/ATM network allows schools from 

        across New Jersey to link to the Liberty Science Center's (LSC) 250 

        exhibits. Currently, access to LSC exhibits is via a series of E-connection 

        programs, e.g. the aquatic ecosystems package. This video conferencing 

        activity links a class of upper primary students studying river ecosystems 

        to a biologist based in the LSC's Hudson River aquarium. After a 

        brief introduction, a camera scans tanks of toadfish, eels and spider 

        crabs. A series of carefully choreographed activities follow, prompting 

        students to ask questions about the habitat and behaviour of each species. 

        Quickly a dialogue begins as the Biologist moves from presenter to conversation 

        facilitator. As well as conversational ability, the presenter needs in-depth 

        knowledge to create an active learning experience built around open-ended 

        dialogue.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">The nature of digitally based, open-ended 

        experience is complex and ideally needs to be sufficiently stimulating 

        to children to elicit many and varied responses and questions. To achieve 

        this, research has demonstrated that digital resources need to be sophisticated 

        enough to (1) encourage children to respond in thoughtful ways, (2) offer 

        response to children's answers, (3) offer variations that are child-controlled, 

        and finally (4) cater to each child's ability level, cognitive development 

        and computer skills, as well as culture/s and language/s (Downes, et al., 

        1999). For all these reasons, we can see why human facilitation of genuinely 

        open-ended learning experiences is still so necessary, and is a learning 

        attribute of video conferencing unmatched by any other active learning 

        typology. </span></p>

      <h1>5. Museum Learning Networks </h1>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Museum learning networks have been 

        around, in internet terms, for a relatively long time. But surprisingly, 

        they have yet to flourish, and indeed even today most museums are preoccupied 

        with developing resources for students working independently, either from 

        home or within a classroom, rather than working in teams. This is understandable 

        as the complexities of building resources to accommodate more than one 

        simultaneous user can be immense. </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Learning networks like the Science 

        Learning Network (<a href="http://sln.org/">http://sln.org/</a>) or STEM 

        (<a

href="http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/education/databased3/stem/stem/stemintro.asp" target="new">http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/education/databased3/stem/stem/stemintro.asp</a>) 

        characteristically provide aggregated access to an array of field trip 

        and expository resources themed around a single discipline like science, 

        contemporary art or the environment. Twelve science centres from across 

        Asia, Europe and the Americas provide content and manage The Science Learning 

        Network (<a href="http://www.tryscience.org/)" target="new">http://www.sln.org/)</a> 

        <a

name="_Hlt503864381"></a><a name="_Hlt503864375"></a> , established in 1996. Within 

        SLN, students can conduct a series of genetic, solar, aviation and oceanographic 

        experiments or participate in one of three collaborative projects, including 

        <i>Monarchs and Migration</i> (<a

href="http://www.sci.mus.mn.us/sln/mona" target="new">http://www.sci.mus.mn.us/sln/mona</a>rchs).</span> 

      </p>

      <h2>Learning through collaboration</h2>

      <p class=Normal>Conceptually <i>Monarchs and Migration</i> uses the natural 

        phenomenon of migration to encourage an international community to build 

        a rich textual, artistic and photographic snapshot of Monarch Butterfly 

        migration. Classes in the USA, Mexico, New Zealand and Australia use galleries 

        and tracking studies to share observations and photographs of migrating 

        Monarch Butterflies. Whilst offering excellent content and tools, <i>Monarchs 

        and Migration,</i> like many learning network activities, is limited in 

        the 'genuinely' collaborative opportunities it offers. These 

        are ideally activities that foster cooperative problem solving through 

        continuous communication. This kind of collaboration is best facilitated 

        via <i>real</i> meetings, or chat rooms and listserves, within which the 

        process of creating a joint product is negotiated. These products can 

        be anything from web-based scrapbooks and photo-albums to reports and 

        diaries, but their design and structure need to be carefully considered 

        to encourage mutual respect and trust amongst collaborators. An excellent 

        example is the National Museum of Science and Industry's STEM project.</p>

      <h2>Users as authors</h2>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">The STEM project is a learning network 

        with a difference. Instead of museum educators and curators producing 

        content, students and teachers do. Students and teachers who visit one 

        of the National Museum of Science and Industry's three museums are 

        invited to compete with one another to create a web resource based around 

        their visit. Invariably those teachers and students who take up the challenge 

        work in teams, both <i>real</i> and virtual. In this way STEM students 

        create products that explore issues, ideas and problems that have roots 

        in their unique experiences, interests and opinions. As in any active 

        learning experience, given the opportunity to control content directly, 

        students are much more likely to be internally motivated to explore issues 

        and ideas close to their hearts. The bonus is that these very same issues 

        are much more likely to be of interest to the resources' intended 

        audience -- other students. <strong></strong></span></p>

      <h1>6. Expository Teaching Resources</h1>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Often found on science and technology 

        museum websites, <i>Expository teaching resources </i>are only now beginning 

        to embrace active learning principles<i>. </i>Primarily developed for 

        children twelve years old or younger<i>, Expository resources</i> ordinarily 

        are comprised of a series of highly structured computer-directed activities 

        through which a set of principles, laws or theories is presented (expository). 

        </span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">The Australian National Science and 

        Technology Centre's <i>Funzone</i> is typical. <i>Funzone </i>(<a

href="http://www.questacon.edu.au/fun_zone.html" target="new">http://www.questacon.edu.au/fun_zone.html</a> 

        <a

name="_Hlt504267392"></a> ) features a series of Macromedia-based puzzles, activities 

        and laboratories where students can conduct web-based experiments. One 

        of these asks students to observe a series of animated lines moving across 

        their screen. After 60 seconds the lines stop moving; however, students 

        observe a motion-after-effect. That is, the lines 'seem' to 

        continue to move across the screen because the brain is so accustomed 

        to the movement, it 'imagines' they are still moving. </span></p>

      <h2>Addressing metacognition problems</h2>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Interaction with other students and 

        with the Macromedia animation itself has been deliberately constrained 

        in <i>Funzone.</i> While this may seem at odds with active learning principles 

        which traditionally encourage open-ended learning experiences, these 'closed' 

        learning resources are not without merit. Potentially they can alleviate 

        some of the metacognition problems often encountered by young children. 

        Metacognition problems can occur when people lose sight of, or can no 

        longer accurately monitor, the success or failure of their own learning 

        because activities are not stimulating, or are too complex. A number of 

        studies have indicated that poor metacognition can also arise when students 

        fail to develop clear-cut learning goals because they are given total 

        control of their learning experience. However, metacognition problems 

        can be addressed through careful navigation and interface design coupled 

        with rigorous remedial evaluation. While this type of work is often time 

        consuming, it is undoubtedly worthwhile as the vast majority of younger 

        children, like older children, still prefer to control their learning 

        experiences.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Therefore the dilemma for <i>Expository 

        resource</i> developers is to find a compromise capable of accommodating 

        both the normal student's desire to explore (active learning) and 

        a specific student's metacognition problems. While there are no easy 

        answers, one possible approach is to try to enrich 'experiments' 

        with layers of additional activity. In the case of <i>Funzone</i>, students 

        could have been offered extension exercises with different coloured lines 

        or lines moving at different speeds available under student control. This 

        kind of 'value adding' to expository resources has the potential 

        to lessen the likelihood of metacognition problems, as it supports limited 

        student exploration and at the same time embraces active learning. Critically, 

        this layering also has the potential to expand student understanding, 

        as it more clearly defines the limitations within which phenomena such 

        as motion-after-effect operate. An excellent example of this kind of <i>Expository 

        </i>layering is the National Museum of Australia's <i>Ann Fibian</i> 

        website (<a

href="http://www.nma.gov.au/education/ann/index.htm)" target="new">http://www.nma.gov.au/education/ann/index.htm)</a>.</span><span class="Normal"> 

        </span><span class="Normal">Here students investigate soil erosion and 

        deforestation phenomenon via a series of expository activities having 

        a carefully set mix of computer and learner controlled activity.</span></p>

      <h1>Do They Work?</h1>

      <p class=Normal>As these six typologies demonstrate, there is no such thing 

        as a sure-fire way to guarantee learning or teaching, only methods or 

        devices (pedagogic or technical) which together facilitate the individual's 

        endeavour (B. Whalley, 1995). Indeed, the deployment of any one of the 

        cognitive strategies I've discussed is not in itself a guarantee 

        students will even pay attention. The best museum educators and designers 

        can do is to carefully consider these cognitive strategies, along with 

        pedagogically appropriate content, design and affordance strategies. But 

        even then we need to recognise that learning is still a process beyond 

        the total control of museums, and is predominantly invested in the individual 

        learner. So even if the mix has been carefully prepared, work can still 

        be undone by the relatively unknown impact of users' unique cognitive, 

        environmental and cultural characteristics. That is why I wish to close 

        this paper with a plea for further research, particularly remedial and 

        summative evaluation. It is not until we have a better understanding of 

        <i>real</i> outcomes, against those intended, that museums will be able 

        to advance the practice of active learning product development. However, 

        I'm mindful that active learning environments are expensive to develop, 

        as are evaluation studies. What's more, I've yet to come across 

        a workable evaluation framework. So in a year when AMOL will be launching 

        its own museum learning gateway, I'm very eager to talk to museums 

        or universities interested in sharing costs and expertise to develop appropriate 

        evaluation frameworks for active learning resources.</p>
