      <p class=PaperTitle>Learning About Leonardo</p>

      <p class=Author>Steve Feld, John F. Kennedy High School, USA</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Leonardo's enigmatic Mona Lisa portrait, painted in 

        the 1500's, coupled with numerous researched museum links served as the 

        cultural catalyst for an ongoing evolving inner city Bronx high school 

        student web research project. </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Begun in 1997, as part of the ThinkQuest Challenge, 

        for developing a collaborative web project focused around a particular 

        problem construct &quot;Why is the Mona Lisa Smiling?&quot; in partnership 

        with peers from Borlange Sweden initially reacted, responded and reflected 

        on Lillian Schwartz's research about the identity of Mona Lisa. </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Schwartz's contention, that Mona was Leonardo himself, 

        led the students to include museum resources as part of their scientific 

        inquiry into the validity of Schwartz's compelling thesis. </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The inner city Bronx HS students who created the web 

        site had little if any personal experiences visiting actual Museum Resources 

        in culturally rich NYC; but through the research process involved in investigating 

        Schwartz's theory, students became online virtual museum visitors, </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Among the Museum Web Sites they toured and integrated 

        within the project were: Getty Museum, Boston Science Museum, Science 

        and Technology Museum of Milan, The Vatican, The Exploratorium, Franklin 

        Institute and The Smithsonian Institution. </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>In turn, the students museum explorations enriched 

        and expanded their initial Why is the Mona Lisa Project, which grew to 

        include further aspects of Leonardo's talents visions and Inventions and 

        connections to other artists and scientists. These were identified in 

        the Museum collection through virtual museum visits. </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Indeed in May 2000, when Microsoft issued its NYC 

        Beyond 2000 </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Challenge, the Bronx HS Students confidently selected 

        the arts </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>arena as the content area for their ArtiFAQ 2100 Web 

        Project. They were able to use museum web resource to address the challenge 

        by using museums to look back in Art History. The then built on the achievements 

        of art history to predict art social trends 2100. These predictions are 

        presented in the form of Digital Art Creations. </p>

      <h1>Mona Makes Museum Magic Happen</h1>

      <p class=normal>The multiple ways in which the use of museum web resources 

        have contributed to Learning About Leonardo's success. Museum web resources 

        have played a dual role in the design development and expansion of our 

        project. The project began in 1997 at the behest of the ThinkQuest organization 

        which encourages students under the advisement and coaching of dedicated 

        teacher educators, to develop web site based on a problem construct. Inspired 

        by the seminal work in the field of Bell Labs researcher Lillian Schwartz, 

        students from the Bronx the John F. Kennedy High School a zoned inner 

        city Public High School, adjacent to the Marble Hill projects, selected 

        the issue of Mona Lisa's identity as the core governing principle of their 

        initial project design.</p>

      <p class=normal>Within this context, the project's initial design of the 

        site features and layout was informed by the key museum resource, The 

        Boston Museum of Science. The design elements of this resource that the 

        students integrated into the design of their web site were:</p>

      <p class=normal>Parchment colored backgrounds and the ease of navigation 

        were the key elements that served as a catalyst for the students to developing 

        the pages. </p>

      <p class=normal>The warm color scheme was perfect for the content and visitor 

        appreciation of the web site content. The background color scheme gave 

        it an apt historical backdrop.</p>

      <p class=normal>Interestingly, despite the significance of Leonardo's achievement 

        and the massive print resources in real museum collections, there was 

        a paucity of museum resources available for student study analysis and 

        reflection. At the time of the site's inception, The Seattle Museum and 

        information about Bill Gate's Codex were just being placed on the web. 

        The development of our project was contiguous with these museum resources. 

        We were in at the beginning when Mona's Magic touch was making itself 

        known on the web.</p>

      <p class=normal>The original question construct as posed by the students 

        -- Why is the Mona Lisa Smiling? became the central developing theme of 

        the original ThinkQuest project.</p>

      <p class=normal>The interest it generated from a multi-sector community 

        of educators, researchers in the field, academics, art historians, teacher 

        educators K-12, schools of education, librarians and museums; engendered 

        and suggested various web resources for our project to link to and collaborate 

        with. Among the principle project milestone collaborations was Japan's 

        Miho Museum and peer high school student in Kyoto Japan. Ovation TV ArtsZone 

        after visiting the site, invited our students to be part of a multicultural 

        dialogue exchange with their peers from Kyoto. The focus of this exchange 

        was the design of the Museum in the Mountain. My students posed questions 

        about the Miho Museum.</p>

      <p class=normal>These were then translated and were responded to by the 

        Japanese peers.</p>

      <p class=normal>Among the products of this museum design centered partnership 

        was a gallery of student designs. This museum international project extended 

        itself into the Social Studies content area. A Social Studies teacher 

        teamed with our art class to generate additional questions that expanded 

        the project's scope into global issues and multicultural concerns.</p>

      <p class=normal>A second Ovation initiative centered on the Codex, which 

        can be found online at the Seattle Art Museum, was brought to our site 

        when our students compiled scientific observations in the format of Leonardo's 

        Notebooks. Their work was added to our site and featured in ArtsZone.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Codex also provides us with the notes and drawings of 

        Leonardo's inventions which establishes his credentials as a futurist 

        circa 1500. Students reviewed his writings and drawings and recognized 

        the connection between Leonardo and Arthur C. Clarke. They developed text 

        and image pages articulating this connection that was published by Artszone.</p>

      <p class=normal>Another footnote to Leonardo's legacy lies in the tale of 

        Leonardo's Bronze Horse. The Leonardo Horse was meant to be realized as 

        a sculpture in his time. However, the bronze needed to realize the project 

        was reallocated to the war effort. Leonardo's clay model for the horse 

        was used for target practice before it could be constructed.</p>

      <p class=normal>Not until 1997 was the funding for this dream supplied and 

        realized by Charles Dent and the Tallix Foundry. As a result of visiting 

        our site, the Leonardo Horse Inc invited the JFK design team to its unveiling 

        in Beacon NY. We were there to document and record this event. It resulted 

        in a new page on our site and a wonderful hands-on student centered web 

        base commemoration of a Leonardo milestone.</p>

      <p class=normal>The development and expansion of our site involves acquiring 

        linkages to museum resources, within the expanse of international Leonardo 

        holdings and collections.</p>

      <p class=normal>Linkages were sought and granted from the following Museums: 

        Boston Science Museum, Seattle Art Museum, Franklin Science Museum, British 

        Columbia Leonardo Exhibit, Museum of Science and Technology of Milan and 

        the Science and Technology Museum of Israel. By far, the most difficult 

        link to secure was that from the Vatican Museum. Aquiring of this link 

        required the convening of a committee of four Italian Professors to certify 

        our site to the Office of the Holy See. These linkages authenticated our 

        Leonardo research and validated his musical score which is presented on 

        the site. Conversely our site has been the source of concentration by 

        museums who, after reviewing the site has used the site as one of their 

        exhibits. Imagine how our inner city Bronx high school students felt when 

        their work is cited and included in the internationally recognized Institutions 

        such as the Getty Center Digital Experience, Kennedy Center for the Performing 

        Arts-Arts Edge and the Smithsonian. Indeed, the 15 year old computers 

        that were used to create the site belong in the Smithsonian as well! After 

        their selection at the Digital Experience at the Getty Museum, the student's 

        interest was peaked as to how and why their high school site was selected. 

        As a result of our inquires to the Getty staff, a letter arrived explaining 

        the criteria behind our selection: Read Letter from Getty:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>July 6,1998 </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Steve Feld</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>John F. Kennedy High School</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Bronx, NY 10463 </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Dear Steve Feld:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Thank you for your recent letter regarding &quot;Learning 

        about Leonardo&quot; and its inclusion in the Getty Information Institute's 

        Digital Experience. Firstly, allow me to congratulate you and your students 

        on an insightful, educational and entertaining Website. &quot;Learning 

        About Leonardo&quot; continues to be an important addition to our Web-O-Rama 

        tours and I am happy to provide you with a letter background on how it 

        was selected. </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>The Digital Experience was implemented in a relative 

        short period of time. In the summer of 1997, in conjunction with the construction 

        of its physical space, a working creative team was established to &quot;construct&quot; 

        the digital and Web based aspects of the project. A dozen people converged 

        from various backgrounds, and interests, including designers, producers, 

        researchers, curators, and several Getty staff, to brainstorm and create 

        a multi-media presentation and a Website in time for the Getty opening 

        in December. The process of choosing the Web links was led by our researcher, 

        Holly Mitchem, an educator at Thatcher High School in Ojai, California. 

        Holly would spend countless hours on the internet looking for the best 

        cultural sites available. She would then forward a substantial list of 

        recommendations to a sub-committee who would peruse each site. The sub-committee, 

        which consisted of five people from the creative team, would meet each 

        week to discuss the content, design, and placement of the recommended 

        sites. Since each one of us had very different interests and tastes, consensus 

        was not reached by simply voting on our favorite site, but by discussing 

        at length, the cultural content presented. By the end of four months, 

        we had developed eight virtual tour categories for the Digital Experience 

        with more than a dozen links for each. </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Web-O-Rama, the tour for younger audiences, was the 

        most fun. Of the many sites we reviewed, &quot;Learning About Leonardo&quot; 

        was the best at offering art historical information, in a new and innovative 

        way. By presenting the morphing images, Da Vinci and his famous portrait 

        of Mona Lisa, you and your students provoke viewers to go beyond &quot;face 

        value&quot; in a very effective way. The historical content provided, 

        by way of links and essays, and musical references are also to be commended. 

      </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I hope this information answers your questions on how 

        &quot;Learning About Leonardo&quot; became an important addition to the 

        Digital Experience inaugural Web site. On behalf of the J. Paul Getty 

        Museum, thank you for your contribution. </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Sincerely,</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>David Jensen Manager, Culture Net Initiatives </p>

      <p class=normal>This original Leonardo project with its study as Leonardo 

        as futurist inspired our students to use Leonardo's creative impetus as 

        the governing design principle for our response to the Microsoft Challenge. 

        The students were asked to predict art trends 2100. Given their expertise 

        and study of Leonardo whose work certainly forecasts inventions of the 

        20th century; they decided to use art history past styles and motivations 

        as a means by which to predict events and environments of 2100. It was 

        exhilarating to see how they transferred knowledge from the Mona Lisa 

        project experience to the research involved in this new project component. 

        Permission was secured from the Paris Pages, the Vincent Van Gogh Museum 

        and Mark Harden's Archive to use the desired images. </p>

      <p class=normal>As I, an experienced arts educator veteran of inner city 

        students review Why is the Mona Lisa installation with its self contained 

        ArtiFAQ 2100 expansion art history project, I am astonished by the extent 

        to which museum web resources are transforming arts in education and providing 

        spatial entry points to multidisciplinary literacy and learning. In light 

        of our experience and ongoing use of museum web resources, we can only 

        hope museums will continue to reach out in a virtual sense to in place 

        school web projects and provide a broad range of partnerships between 

        museums and schools. Together, we educators, can nurture online lifelong 

        literacy and arts appreciation. May Mona manifest her momentum for the 

        21st century through the use of Museum resources as student centered springboards 

        and captivating catalysts. <b></b></p>

        students were asked to search for relevant artwork representing past artistic 

        achievements. Once they selected these, they had to justify their selection 

        process. They were then asked to write for permission to use the work 

        on their site. Paris Pages gave permission to use Mona Lisa. The Van Gogh 

        Museum did as well for Starry Night. Mark Harden generously provided us 

        with additional work from The Archive.</p>

      <p class=normal>Permissions were duly secured.</p>

      <p class=normal>They utilized sophisticated HTML coding to build browser

        which enables the visitors to access the gallery.</p>

      <p class=normal>They created many works of digitized computer graphics, 

        building on trends and achievements of the past, to fill the walls of 

        the virtual gallery.</p>
