      <h1 class="PaperTitle">Artifact as Inspiration: Using existing collections 

        and management systems to inform and create new narrative structures</h1>

      <h2 class="Author">Diane Andolsek, Experience Music Project, Michael Freedman, 

        Plumb Design, Inc, USA</h2>

      <h1 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h1>

      <p class=AbstractText>Experience Music Project (EMP), which opened in Seattle, 

        Washington, in June 2000, is an interactive, experiential museum dedicated 

        to exploring creativity and innovation in American popular music. The 

        museum features a broad range of exhibits of rock 'n' roll memorabilia, 

        such as lyrics, photographs, and musical equipment, and a variety of immersive, 

        multimedia experiences. Part of EMP's mandate is to capture the energy 

        and excitement of music through patron participation, including hands-on 

        activities such as "Sound Lab" and "On Stage" and to use the latest interactive 

        technology to improve the patron's experience. EMP's Online 

        Development team chose Plumb Design, an interactive services and software 

        firm in New York City experienced in standalone and complementary digital 

        exhibits, to collaborate on both the museum's main site, <a href="http://www.emplive.com/" target="new">www.emplive.com</a>, 

        and its companion virtual exhibit, the EMP Digital Collection. This paper 

        will focus on the latter.</p>

      <h1>About the EMP Digital Collection</h1>

      <p class=Normal>The EMP Digital Collection (EDC) is a browser-based exhibit 

        of artifacts that is accessible through two outlets: within the museum, 

        through workstations in the Digital Lab, and on the Web, through emplive.com. 

        These dual modes of access extend the museum experience onsite and through 

        any PC's Web-browser. The Digital Collection lets EMP share more 

        artifacts than there is room for within the building at one time and provides 

        additional information about, and rich media related to, individual artifacts 

        that are currently on display. Both museum patrons and Web users benefit 

        from the Digital Collection's interface, which, through Thinkmap® 

        data animation and visualization software, shows the network of relationships 

        amongst artifacts and provides the essential context that helps users 

        place each item in the larger history of American popular music. Any artifact 

        selected by the user can serve as the conceptual center of a diagram that 

        represents the relationships amongst the items in the Digital Collection. 

        As the user moves from artifact to artifact, the display of relationships 

        changes instantly, positioning the chosen artifact as the nexus from which 

        a new unique set of relationships stems.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Thinkmap solution takes the form of floating blue tiles--each 

        representing a single artifact--that align themselves along a navigable 

        timeline; when the user moves the mouse over a tile, a brief description 

        of that artifact appears in a small word-balloon. The combination of the 

        timeline and the rollover functionality lets users choose an era or artifact 

        that interests them and allows them to see and traverse the connections 

        between both obviously related and seemingly disparate items. Within the 

        same screen there is also a column of thumbnail images, each representing 

        an artifact in the timeline, which provides visual context for moving 

        through the Collection.</p>

      <h1>Requirements/Vendor</h1>

      <p class=normal>In searching for an appropriate solution for bringing artifacts 

        from its collection online, EMP had a number of requirements, the definition 

        of which was essential in helping it pick both an outside vendor and a 

        development platform. First, the Digital Collection needed to be expandable 

        after the initial launch, and that growth needed to be possible independent 

        of the vendor. (At launch, the Digital Collection comprised 1,100 artifacts, 

        as of January 2001, it comprises 1,600.) To reduce maintenance costs, 

        staffing needs, and time to launch, the solution needed to work with EMP's 

        existing collections software, which was not an off-the-shelf solution 

        but a system created in-house. Because one of the goals was to increase 

        the size of the potential viewing audience, the Digital Collection had 

        to offer both on- and offsite access. To help new users get started, its 

        interface had to be more conducive to browsing than to searching, and 

        it had to provide a variety of entries into the information. The final 

        result had to offer diverse information about each piece in the Digital 

        Collection, including the main artifact text, audio clips, and links to 

        related information. To that end, EMP and Plumb Design developed a digital 

        experience that lets visitors to the EMP museum and Web site shape their 

        own journey through the Digital Collection.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Digital Collection uses an intuitive and dynamic interface 

        that integrates the various EMP databases and interactive experiences 

        to present an overview of the collection and the museum. The system works 

        by linking the database from which Thinkmap pulls its data to EMP's 

        existing collections management software. To add items to the Digital 

        Collection, EMP simply marks them, within the collections management software, 

        as available to the Web or to the onsite access points. Each artifact 

        is automatically placed in the correct location within the interface. 

        EMP can then check the display of information within a staging environment. 

        When it is ready for the public, it simply pushes the staging environment 

        to the live environments.</p>

      <p class=normal>Because of this high degree of integration, there is no 

        sense that an artifact was merely tacked on as an afterthought; each new 

        entry is cataloged and categorized to ensure that it is completely connected 

        to related artifacts. Through this simple process, the Digital Collection 

        is kept fresh and can expand as needed. The process also allows for a 

        streamlined workflow; EMP doesn't need a separate staff to painstakingly 

        reenter information into a discrete database for the Digital Collection, 

        it simply designates artifacts and their collective descriptive information 

        as publishable.</p>

      <h1>Reenvisioning Artifacts</h1>

      <p class=normal>The flexibility of the EMP Digital Collection granted the 

        team a remarkable amount of freedom in conceiving possibilities for the 

        formation of narrative. Release from the constraints of the purely physical 

        exhibit allowed us to take a different approach to the artifacts; we saw 

        them not as ends, but as means. For example, all artifacts in the Digital 

        Collection are "clickable," and selecting an artifact brings up not only 

        information about that item (e.g., its date and location of manufacture, 

        its story), but also links to Associated Names and Related Keywords. These 

        text links are placed at the end of each artifact's story to suggest 

        paths for exploration, but there are also two visual methods through which 

        the artifacts serve as navigation elements: the interactive timeline, 

        which puts related information in a temporal context, and the thumbnail 

        photos of related artifacts, a more emotive and spontaneous way for users 

        to continue their navigation. This diversity of entry points opens up 

        the Digital Collection to use by an audience with different learning styles 

        and different levels of familiarity and comfort with computers and the 

        Web.</p>

      <p class=normal>Artifacts also become an important element in storytelling, 

        but not in the traditional sense. Typically, a curator has a story to 

        tell and he/she uses artifacts to help illustrate that story. These stories 

        tend to be presented in a linear, directed fashion in the museum setting. 

        In the majority of the Digital Collection, however, there is no imposed 

        narrative, only suggestions; users are empowered to follow their own interests 

        and pursue the stories that most interest them. For the museum, this laissez-faire 

        approach--putting the artifacts in the patrons' control--enables 

        users to discover the breadth and depth of the Digital Collection in a 

        way that traditional, curated exhibits might not permit. Traditional Web 

        environments, of course, also offer this type of exploration, but the 

        fluidity of the Digital Collection interface allows users to follow a 

        whimsical path with little effort. (This capacity for constant movement 

        and change reinforces the museum's mission and message: rock 'n' 

        roll is never stagnant; it is marked by constant change and relentless 

        energy.) In addition, the history graph, a scrolling bar of text at the 

        bottom of the display, lets users retrace their steps easily and eliminates 

        the usual penalties (confusion, endless clicking backwards) that users 

        suffer for changing their minds while browsing. The Digital Collection 

        also differs from a traditional exhibit in that its contents need not 

        be tangible objects; the multimedia nature of the Digital Collection easily 

        allows for the inclusion of audio clips, including music, narrative descriptions, 

        and first-person accounts.</p>

      <p class=normal>For those users who prefer greater structure, and to acclimate 

        new users to the functions of the different sections of the interface, 

        EMP also provides a number of more traditional online exhibits that explore 

        a particular aspect of rock 'n' roll history. But even the terminology 

        used to describe these exhibits--"EMP Suggests"--underscores the 

        importance the museum as an institution places on the patrons' individual 

        interests and natural curiosity. These exhibits can be deleted, archived, 

        and replaced with new exhibits, allowing the curator to take an active 

        role in keeping the Digital Collection fresh and ensuring that it continues 

        to be a valuable educational resource for EMP.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Digital Collection's storytelling capabilities 

        are facilitated by the symbiotic relationship between the museum's 

        cataloging system and the EDC database--because the cataloging system 

        allows for multiple categorizations, the interface is able to take advantage 

        of and expose the connections amongst multiple artifacts. For example, 

        an award given to the musician Little Richard is, predictably, categorized 

        as an award. However, it is also associated with Little Richard himself, 

        vocalists, and rhythm-and-blues musicians, among other links.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><a href="andolsekfig2.html" name="fig2"><img src="andolsek_fig2_sm.jpg" width="400" height="282" border="0" alt="Artifact Record for the Cash Box Award to Little Richard Displayed in the EDC"></a><br>

        Fig. 2: Artifact Record for the Cash Box Award to Little Richard Displayed 

        in the EDC </p>

      <p class=normal>Users can see these associations, decide which aspect of 

        the award is most interesting to them, and pursue that line of inquiry. 

        For example, selecting the Related Keyword "rhythm-and-blues musicians" 

        brings up a wide variety of artifacts spanning media and eras, from a 

        poster promoting a 1995 James Brown concert to a 1964 photograph of Jimi 

        Hendrix performing with the Isley Brothers at a New Jersey country club. 

      </p>

        Fig. 3: EDC display of the Cash Box Award to Little Richard</p>

      <p class=normal>There is a caveat to this arrangement; as with any database-driven 

        system, the information that is extracted is only as good as the information 

        that is entered into the individual artifact<b> </b>record. Therefore, 

        the fields included in the record may need to be reevaluated. The typical 

        museum catalog is designed for people to find artifacts. It is not designed 

        to illuminate relationships. EMP went through and systematically wrote 

        editorial content for each of the artifacts in order to ensure that the 

        Digital Collection displayed as much contextual information as it had 

        at its disposal. The catalog has descriptions such as vinyl record, scratch 

        on inner lining. This material is what makes the whole experience so pleasurable 

        and rewarding for the user. Most museums may feel that they don't 

        have the time or resources to do this and therefore may only release a 

        limited amount of their material to the public. EMP had a team of six 

        people working for three months to ensure that 1,000 artifacts would be 

        fully cataloged by opening for this purpose. In addition, the EMP catalogers 

        actually inputted information into existing fields that ultimately were 

        not included in the Thinkmap display, but it was important to enter the 

        information to keep the options for connections open. These are the fields 

        that are selected for an artifact when it is displayed: ArtifactID, ArtifactNumber, 

        ArtifactName, ArtifactClass, FullTitle, Edition, ScopeContentNotes, Materials, 

        HistoryRemarks, CollectionStatus, ExhibitName, GalleryTitle, GalleryUniqueID, 

        StmtofResponsibility, Exhibited, ArtifactCreditLine, AcquisitionCreditLine, 

        and ExhibitCreditLine. The significant fields that actually relate artifacts 

        to each other are ArtifactClass, ArtifactName (not the title), and StmtofResponsiblity 

        (singer, photographer, etc.).</p>

      <h1>How/ where the EDC is used</h1>

      <p class=normal>There are three opportunities for users to expand, enrich, 

        and personalize their experience of EMP by creating their own narratives 

        from the wealth of information in the Digital Collection. The first is 

        the Museum Exhibit Guide (MEG), handheld technology that provides a customized 

        museum tour to patrons. Using audio compression technology and the Microsoft 

        Windows CE operating system, it delivers 20 hours of on-demand audio content. 

        This supplementary content enhances the EMP experience by giving visitors 

        instant access to in-depth information about a gallery, exhibit, or artifact 

        and by allowing them to bookmark interesting items for further investigation 

        in the Digital Lab or at home via the Web.</p>

      <p class=normal>To use the MEG, patrons simply carry it with them throughout 

        their visit to the museum; artifacts that have related audio are marked 

        with a numbered guitar pick label. Users simply enter the number corresponding 

        to the artifact of interest via the keypad or via the hotlink on the MEG 

        display to hear the related audio. Visitors push a different button, indicated 

        with an image of an actual bookmark, to bookmark artifacts for future 

        investigation. Full integration is the key to the MEG's success as 

        an engaging learning tool; using the unique visitor ticket ID issued to 

        them upon entrance to the museum, patrons can pull up their bookmarks 

        via the Digital Collection in the Digital Lab or at home on the Web. This 

        capability gives users additional time to absorb the impact of what they've 

        learned at the museum and lets them spend more time exploring. And it 

        gives people who were pulled away from the kiosks by their sore-footed 

        family and friends another opportunity to immerse themselves in the EDC. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>EMP chose to use the MEG, and integrate it with the Digital 

        Collection, for a number of reasons. The MEG embodies EMP's commitment 

        to technology, interactivity, and participation, and it helps EMP and 

        the user make the most of the multimedia artifacts within the museum--how 

        effective could a museum about music be if patrons could not hear the 

        music? The MEG also adds another level of interactivity to the museum 

        experience; patrons are not simply passive recipients of information--they 

        are active participants in learning. It reinforces the element of freedom; 

        in contrast to a standard museum audio tour, users can choose which artifacts 

        they will hear more about. By being active participants, patrons feel 

        greater control and ownership of the museum experience. Finally, the MEG 

        appeals to a diverse audience by increasing the number of avenues through 

        which users can receive information. </p>

      <p class=normal>Another opportunity for users to experiment with creating 

        narrative is the onsite Compaq Digital Lab, a quiet room with 24 networked 

        workstations that give patrons the chance to continue their museum experience 

        through the Digital Collection. In this setting, the Digital Collection 

        gives patrons access to additional information on artifacts they've 

        seen in the museum exhibits and shows artifacts that might not be on view 

        within EMP. The workstations also give users the opportunity to start 

        a completely new search and follow an idea sparked by an item that is 

        shown in the interface but wasn't available for viewing within the 

        museum.</p>

      <p class=normal>For home users who either have not visited or cannot visit 

        Seattle, the Digital Collection on the Web offers a taste of the EMP experience, 

        extending the museum's reach outside of its Seattle home. The Digital 

        Collection offers users an experience unlike anything on the Web, a deep 

        well of multimedia information on the history of American popular music 

        presented in a uniquely fun and educational format. The Web version also 

        allows museum patrons who wish to continue their exploration after they 

        leave the Seattle building to gain access to their bookmarks (using their 

        ticket ID) and continue their EMP experience at home. In this setting, 

        freedom from time constraints allows for an in-depth exploration that 

        might not have been possible during the user's visit to EMP.</p>

      <h1>Relationships: the museum, the artifact, and the patron</h1>

      <p class=normal>By freeing artifacts from traditional narrative structures, 

        a new mode of interaction between visitors and the museum is formed, both 

        the museum as an entity and the museum's artifacts. The perception 

        of the museum as an institution changes from a withholder or controller 

        of information and stories to an open container. Rather than seeing this 

        as a threat, as the ceding of curatorial authority, museums should consider 

        the possibilities inherent in granting greater autonomy to the patron. 

        The narrative becomes a living, limber thing, not a static or fixed entity.</p>
