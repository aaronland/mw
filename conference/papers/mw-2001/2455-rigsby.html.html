        for the Monterey Bay Aquarium's web site</h1>

      <h2 class="Author">Lauralee Alben, AlbenFaris Inc., Michael Rigsby, Monterey 

        Bay Aquarium, USA</h2>

      <h1 class="abstractTitle">Abstract</h1>

      <span class="AbstractText">This presentation focuses on the strategic design 

      planning and vision creation process for the E-Quarium, the online complement 

      to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. More than six months of informed investigation 

      and analysis resulted in an ambitious redesign of the web site, which launched 

      in October 1999. The aquarium and AlbenFaris worked in close partnership 

      in a collaborative development process that included visitor research, establishment 

      of a clear strategic vision, a set of goals and content objectives, identification 

      of target audiences, scenario planning, competitive analysis, site definition 

      and design. As a result, the new E-Quarium exemplifies the relevance of 

      grounded design practice.case study, this is a thoughtful weaving of the process, perspectives and 

      experiences the designers gained from understanding the aquarium's structure, 

      mission and culture and the needs of the aquarium's key audiences. The inclusion 

      of experts in marine biology and conservation, exhibition design and technology 

      as members of the development team provided inspiration and insights beyond 

      the normal boundaries of interactive design. This 

      presentation is also a journey into the wonder of kelp forests and the deep 

      sea-habitats showcased in the aquarium exhibits and the online E-Quarium. 

      Both the physical aquarium and the E-Quarium have a profound effect on visitors, 

      inspiring and informing them about the wonders of the oceans. And both serve 

      as catalysts, making visitors aware of ocean conservation issues and encouraging 

      them to join with the Monterey Bay Aquarium in the cause of ocean conservation.

      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

      <p class=normal>Widely acclaimed as the most innovative aquarium in the 

        world, the Monterey Bay Aquarium was founded in 1978 by marine biologists 

        and Hewlett-Packard co-founder David Packard. With a mission to inspire 

        conservation of the oceans, the aquarium maintains cutting-edge conservation 

        research programs for threatened sea otters and for bluefin tuna and other 

        open ocean fishes. Since 1984, it has attracted more than 27 million visitors 

        and has set attendance records among U.S. aquariums. It has pioneered 

        living exhibits of jellies, open ocean animals and deep sea creatures. 

        Aquarium education programs welcome more than 90,000 students and teachers 

        each year.</p>

      <p class=normal>In late 1997 the Monterey Bay Aquarium committed to a major 

        redesign and expansion of its existing E-Quarium web site. In developing 

        new projects, the aquarium places a high value on both internal teamwork 

        and involving visitors in the design process by identifying and meeting 

        their needs and expectations. For this project, the aquarium selected 

        AlbenFaris Inc. as its design partner because of their high-quality interaction 

        design and because it recognized them as a firm with whom the aquarium 

        could work in a close, collaborative partnership. This partnership, along 

        with efforts of a large team, launched the new E-Quarium in October 1999.</p>

      <h1>THE E-QUARIUM VISION</h1>

      <p class=BlockQuote>&quot;People see us a trusted guide; they sense that 

        we care. Let's find new ways to reach their hearts and minds and move 

        them to become more connected with the oceans.&quot; </p>

      <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>Julie Packard, Executive Director</p>

      <p class=normal>A culmination of more than six months of intensive investigation 

        and analysis, the overall vision for the E-Quarium crystallized into an 

        inspiring context that informed the site design. The E-Quarium was designed 

        to become &quot;Your Ocean Link&quot;-a trusted guide to ocean information. 

        The E-Quarium reflects the aquarium's commitment to cutting-edge exhibits, 

        scientific accuracy and educational innovations. It also incorporates 

        the latest advances in web design and e-commerce.<br>

      </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="rigsby_albenfig1.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="299" alt="Figure 1. Site vision and relationships"><br>

        Figure 1. Site vision and relationships</p>

      <p class=normal>The vision statement called for the site to create relationships 

        with visitors at several different levels. At its core, the site would 

        connect visitors with the aquarium and with the aquarium's mission to 

        inspire ocean conservation. </p>

      <p class=normal>The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a regional aquarium, focusing 

        on the marine life and marine conservation issues of the Monterey Bay 

        National Marine Sanctuary (the largest and richest of the nation's protected 

        marine areas.) Thus, the second ring of connection was to sanctuary. Beyond 

        these waters lie the world's oceans, and, since the web site would have 

        global reach, the next ring of connection would be to the greater oceans 

        beyond Monterey Bay. </p>

      <p class=normal>At the outer ring, tying together all the others, were the 

        visitors themselves. Therefore, the goal was to design ways to make meaningful 

        connections between our visitors and the ocean, visitors and the aquarium 

        and among visitors themselves.</p>

      <h1>VISITOR NEEDS AND GOALS</h1>

      <p class=BlockQuote>&quot;I am 11 years old. I have already written to the 

        President about protecting dolphins because they are my favorite animals. 

        He wrote me back saying that he would do something to help them. I love 

        your aquarium so much that I went there to celebrate my birthday. I think 

        you could make it even better though if you put a section where people 

        could complain about any marine mammals that they think are being treated 

        unfairly.&quot;</p>

      <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>Leor Friedman, San Francisco</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>&quot;We need to build a site that starts you out in 

        third grade and then grows with you.&quot; </p>

      <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>Steve Webster, Marine Science Advisor</p>

      <p class=normal>The initial phase of the multiyear project involved creating 

        a strategic plan that would guide the team through the development of 

        the site. We began by conducting internal research at the aquarium. Through 

        ongoing conversations with the aquarium's Internet Producer, and the extensive 

        review of aquarium publications and documents, the designers became immersed 

        in the aquarium's structure and culture. We then began a series of in-depth 

        interviews with aquarium staff and volunteers to identify the desires, 

        concerns and perceived opportunities of key departments and work groups. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>From this research, we defined five main target audiences: 

        children in grades K-12, their parents, K-12 teachers, adults age 25-55 

        without children, and aquarium members. Aquarium volunteers and members 

        of the Press were targeted as secondary audiences.</p>

      <p class=normal>Based on the audiences we wished to reach, we then began 

        a period of visitor research. We created an online demographic survey 

        to determine who was using the existing site, how they were using it and 

        what features or content they would like or expect to find on the site. 

        Concurrently, we conducted in-depth interviews with members of each audience 

        group. We also reviewed two-year's worth of unsolicited visitor ideas, 

        comments and suggestions from the existing site, to find commonalties 

        in what our existing online audience was asking for. We then identified 

        the strategic opportunities inherent in our findings.</p>

      <p class=normal>Among the key demographic findings was that 30% of the visitors 

        to the existing site were teenagers-one of our primary target audiences. 

        This large percentage, despite fact that teenagers don't typically visit 

        the physical aquarium, spoke to the tremendous opportunity for the new 

        site. We also found that 56% of those in the survey had visited the aquarium 

        between two and five times, while 27% had never visited the aquarium. 

        These results pointed to both the possibilities of strengthening the bond 

        with existing visitors and making them more deeply aware of and involved 

        in marine conservation, as well as the opportunity to reach large numbers 

        of new visitors. </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="rigsby_albenfig2.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="301" alt="Figure 2. Needs/benefits analysis"><br>

        Figure 2. Needs/benefits analysis</p>

      <p class=normal>Based on staff interviews and the results of our audience 

        research, we identified both key aquarium goals and visitors' needs. We 

        then created a needs/benefits analysis to position the site content to 

        best serve both the aquarium and its visitors.</p>

      <h1>SITE DEFINITION</h1>

      <p class=BlockQuote>&quot;The aquarium is one of the best, well thought 

        through, most complete exhibits of local marine biology that there could 

        possibly be. The aquarium is at the top if its class and the web site 

        should be too. The site is going to have to be wildly creative, innovative 

        and technologically advanced to get me to visit it often.&quot;</p>

      <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>Steve Shimek, marine biologist and aquarium member</p>

      <p class=normal>During the site definition phase, we conducted an analysis 

        of the aquarium's existing site and a competitive analysis of other aquarium, 

        zoo, museum, and conservation sites, comparing content and technology. 

        We identified areas of improvement for the new site and opportunities 

        to extend the site beyond what others were currently offering.</p>

      <p class=normal>We also looked at the aquarium's core values and brand identity, 

        and the desirable attributes for the new site as expressed during aquarium 

        staff interviews and matched these with the characteristic strengths of 

        the web medium. From this, we created a list of design attributes for 

        the site to guide us during later development. These included building 

        a site that was informative, interactive, fluid, that could be kept current, 

        and that could grow and evolve easily over time.</p>

      <p class=normal>Informed by our visitor interviews, we mapped out four scenarios 

        (one for each of the target audiences) to predict how visitors might interact 

        and move through the site. These included a ten-year-old kid who visited 

        the E-Quarium with his mom in order to research his sea otter report; 

        an adult with out kids who was planning an aquarium visit; an aquarium 

        member who visited the Member section and stayed up-to-date on the current 

        events at the aquarium; and a teacher planning a unit on marine science 

        and a field trip.</p>

        Figure 3. Visitor scenario planning</p>

      <p class=normal>With the results of our research, we created a vision statement 

        for the new site, detailed the scope of the project, and created a preliminary 

        site architecture. We created several prototypes, conducted usability 

        tests and a final design that continues to evolve today.</p>

      <h1>THE E-QUARIUM LAUNCH</h1>

      <p class=normal>In the presentation, we will also take a tour through the 

        new E-Quarium, showing how the strategic design planning is reflected 

        in the end result, and how both the site content and design are expressions 

        of the vision statement.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="rigsby_albenfig4.jpg" width="400" height="503" alt="Figure 4. Final web page design for habitats path"><br>

        Figure 4. Final web page design for habitats path</p>

      <p class=normal>The design, informed by over one hundred and forty people 

        from aquarium staff, members and volunteers as well as E-Quarium visitors 

        from around the world, reflects our best attempts to meet everyone's needs 

        and desires. If the E-Quarium e-mail is any indication, the site is reaching 

        people's hearts and minds as they join with the Monterey Bay Aquarium 

        in conserving the world's oceans. </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>&quot;We are all feeling very happy and hopeful because 

        we could find out there are still in our world people like you, that love 

        life and work so hard and efficiently for its protection. Thank you for 

        the beautiful feeling you gave us, and also for the great contribution 

        to my children's education.&quot;</p>
