      <h1 class="PaperTitle">In the Wireless Economy, the World is Listening -- 

        To What <i>It</i> Wants to Hear</h1>

      <h2 class="Author">Chris Tellis, Nancy Proctor, Antenna Audio, USA</h2>

      <h1 class="abstractTitle">Abstract</h1>

      <span class="AbstractText">In the face of press and industry hype around 

      new media, it is often difficult to understand what recent developments 

      in digital technology mean for the cultural sector. Just what <i>is</i> 

      new under the sun, and what is the same old marketing speak in new clothes?</span><span class="AbstractText">Today 

      I'd like to boil the techno-babble down to two important developments 

      that are already effecting major shifts in how cultural tourists access 

      and experience information. These shifts are prime opportunities for museums 

      and cultural institutions to extend their audiences and the reach of the 

      museum message while generating new revenue streams. </span><span class="AbstractText">The 

      main technological development impacting the cultural sector today is the 

      rise of audio as the medium of choice in communicating information through 

      mobile devices. The second issue I'd like to address is the new freedom 

      that tourists have in shaping their experience of cultural destinations 

      thanks to content syndication across a range of digital platforms.</span>

      <h1>I. Mobile Information and the Cultural Sector</h1>

      <p class=normal>The doyens of dot com might think of themselves as pioneers, 

        but those with a more historical view can recognize the 'new media 

        revolution' as being a very old phenomenon indeed. Early in the 20<sup>th</sup> 

        century, the social and cultural landscape was transformed by the advent 

        of something that was popularly referred to as 'the wireless'. 

        Bringing news and entertainment into people's homes, offices, cars 

        and handheld devices, the radio continues to broaden audiences and reach 

        vast audiences today.</p>

      <p class=normal>Now 'wireless' has become a buzzword again, this 

        time referring to a major transformation driven by the advent of digital 

        technology. The digital age has rendered audio a completely fluid medium, 

        capable of being accessed across a variety of different platforms. Consequently, 

        the cultural sector has the ability to provide far more extensive programming, 

        reaching out to a much broader audience&nbsp;via personal computers, handheld 

        computers and personal organizers, and mobile phones than ever before.</p>

      <p class=normal>The emphasis in this new technology is mobility: people 

        want all of the tools and convenience of their personal computers while 

        on the go, and increasingly they are able to take their digital media 

        with them thanks to developments in wireless technologies.</p>

      <p class=normal>However, there is a major difference between these new wireless 

        platforms and the 'wired' personal computer: unlike the PC environment, 

        in which the user interacts with screens of text and images, the person 

        on the move cannot usually spend much time looking at a screen. The person 

        walking through a building or city, or driving through a landscape, cannot 

        navigate those spaces very safely if their eyes are glued to a screen! 

        So in the wireless world, audio rather than visual media is the basis 

        for communication. </p>

      <p class=normal>Museums are in a prime position to capitalize on new media's 

        preference for audio, as all major and most smaller museums and galleries 

        now provide audio interpretation of their exhibitions and collections 

        as a matter of course. These archives of audio content, enhanced where 

        appropriate with related text and images, are ripe for repurposing for 

        digital platforms, allowing the museum to reach new and larger audiences 

        outside as well as inside its walls. Furthermore, since museums are the 

        conservators of vast archives of images, their own holdings complete the 

        loop of image and audio required to distribute rich media products.</p>

      <p class=normal>The proliferation of handheld appliances now on the market 

        - including cellular phones, personal organizers (PDAs), 'palmtop' 

        computers such as Casiopeia and the Compaq iPaq, and portable MP3 players 

        -- are 'converging' to such an extent that PDAs can now 

        make telephone calls and store a music library, while cellular phones 

        can access the Internet and play games. The evolution of high speed, 

        high volume data transfer rates, global positioning ability and higher 

        storage capacity for these devices are giving rise to a wide range of 

        applications that are revolutionizing the way the cultural tourist experiences 

        the world. Yet at the basis of communication across all of these mobile 

        devices is audio - the truly cross-platform medium.</p>

      <p class=normal>The downloadable MP3 file represents the first step towards 

        making audio more freely available to this wide range of mobile devices. 

        MP3 compression technology allows sound files to be delivered across digital 

        platforms relatively quickly and easily. Distinct from '3G' 

        technology that allows audio files to be delivered from the Internet to 

        cellular phones, MP3 files can be downloaded or copied from the Internet 

        onto a computer or computerized handheld device and stored on it for reuse, 

        much as a word processing file can be copied from one computer to another. 

        The MP3 file has rocked the music industry as audiophiles swap songs across 

        the Internet, and built a booming industry for makers of MP3 players -- 

        the gift of choice this past Christmas.</p>

      <p class=normal>Antenna Audio has recently created two digital MP3 tours 

        that tourists can download from the Internet onto a Visor, Diamond Rio 

        or other MP3 player, take to the gallery and<span class="Normal"> experience 

        on their own handheld device. Both the Cleopatra exhibition at Palazzo 

        Grassi in Rome until July, and the 'Life of Christ Trail' through 

        the permanent collection of the National Gallery in London, can now be 

        downloaded from the Internet, together with gallery maps. These tours 

        will be available from a variety of websites and portals to maximise publicity 

        for the exhibition and galleries, and extend access to this cultural information 

        even to those who cannot visit the galleries in person. At the time of 

        this writing the Cleopatra tour is already available at the ciaoweb.it 

        site. By March and April you will be able to visit any one of these additional 

        locations on the web to see how the MP3 downloadable tour works: </span></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>[Demonstration of a portion of an MP3 tour available 

        on the web.]</p>

      <p class=normal>As the capacity increases of handheld devices to store and 

        receive rich media content from either downloads or live broadcasts, the 

        complexity of content that tourists will be able to take with them on 

        their travels will naturally increase. Soon, high definition tours of 

        both an educational and commercial nature will be experienced not just 

        on desktop PCs, but also on screen-based handhelds. 'Virtual tours' 

        on the Internet have suffered in the past from the slowness of download 

        of information to computers, which has led designers to compromise on 

        quality of image and audio. Great strides have now been made in rich media 

        technologies in the 'wired' arena, such as this 'virtual 

        poster gallery' that Antenna Audio has produced with MuseumShop and 

        the 3-d modelling software specialists, RichFX. </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>[Demo of 'virtual poster gallery'.] </p>

      <p class=normal>It is only a matter of time before such virtual tours will 

        be available not only to the would-be tourist in Deli who cannot attend 

        the Cleopatra exhibition in Rome, but also to the cultural tourist planning 

        his/her trip and downloading all sorts of rich media information onto 

        their handheld device to accompany his or her travels.</p>

      <p class=normal>Clearly the next step is to provide this information 'on 

        demand' via intelligent systems that recognize where the tourist 

        is, either inside a museum or travelling through a city, and make information 

        on cultural landmarks in the immediate area available to the tourist's 

        handheld device. Though it will be some time before this technology is 

        ready for use in museums, Antenna Audio is currently conducting a trial 

        with a personal area network developers to demonstrate how the cutting 

        edge of wireless technology will transform the cultural tourist's 

        experience yet again within the next three years.</p>

      <h1>II. Syndication and the Cultural Tourist: Information on Demand</h1>

      <p class=normal>With information increasingly available to cultural tourists' 

        personal digital devices, it is inevitable that tourists should seize 

        the opportunity to become their own tour guides, compiling information 

        from a variety of sources to take with them on their travels. If the 'wireless 

        world' is listening, then it's listening to audio of its own 

        choosing.</p>

      <p class=normal>Other than radio and television broadcasts, the distribution 

        of information in the past has been relegated to pre-recorded content 

        that is packaged in various storage media in order to be sold as cassette 

        tape, CD-ROM, video, or the like. This pre-packaged content necessarily 

        involved an editor or program director who decided its format, length 

        and components. Thus the music industry decided that albums would contain 

        10-12 songs, and that only 1-2 of these would be available for single 

        purchase as 'singles'. Similarly, publishers have compiled collections 

        of essays, forcing the scholar to pay the price for the entire book, even 

        if they only wanted to read one small section.</p>

      <p class=normal>Not only have consumers traditionally purchased information 

        in combinations and formats determined by others, but doing so has generally 

        required them to visit the store or other venue where the tape, CD, or 

        video is sold. The information industry seems to have offered an ever-increasing 

        choice of products for sale, but very little choice in how and where consumers 

        can get the information they want.</p>

      <p class=normal>The real revolution of the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, 

        then, is not just mobile communications: all sorts of informational media, 

        ranging from the radio to the daily news have been 'wireless' 

        for, in some cases, millennia. What is truly new about the latest 'new 

        media' is that for the first time consumers can access <i>just </i>the 

        information they want, when and where they want it. We are now at the 

        dawn of the age of <i>information on demand</i>, where consumers can be 

        liberated from both the editorial dictates of publishers, and the physical 

        commerce in tapes, CDs, videos, etc. The face of publishing and distributing 

        information is being irrevocably changed, and with it the very concepts 

        of the book, the magazine, the album, and the audio tour.</p>

      <p class=normal>Never before has the demand been so high for cultural institutions 

        to respond to the needs and interests of the individuals who make up their 

        audiences. Just as you can sell individual artworks rather than entire 

        exhibitions, information on those artworks can now be syndicated across 

        digital platforms to allow cultural tourists to compile their own editions 

        of text, images, audio and video about the objects, people and places 

        that interest them. Increasingly cultural tourists want to dip into catalogues 

        and other information sources in much the same way as they chart their 

        own tours through the museum space itself, choosing to linger over some 

        works while passing others by.</p>

      <p class=normal>The cultural landscape from the point of view of the new 

        media tourist resembles the now much-imitated cartoon map of New York 

        City, where only the buildings of greatest interest are emphasized and 

        space between them is collapsed to render the image a mental 'map' 

        of the city as popularly imagined.</p>

      <p class=normal>For the cultural tourist, the city is mapped by a few key 

        destinations that are icons for that city. S/he does not distinguish between 

        items of cultural importance to be visited within museum walls, and those 

        destinations that lie elsewhere in the city. The cultural tourist to Paris 

        simply knows that s/he must see the Eiffel Tower, the Mona Lisa, and Notre 

        Dame. Thus the cultural tourist wants a guide to Paris that can provide 

        information on all of these cultural landmarks in one convenient package. 

        The modern cultural tourist is sophisticated and wants authoritative commentary 

        on all of these, but doesn't want to carry around a catalogue to 

        the Louvre, a book on19<sup>th</sup> century iron engineering, and Pevsner's 

        guide to medieval cathedrals in order to get the most out of a visit to 

        Paris.</p>

      <p class=normal>For the first time, cultural tourists can now compile their 

        own guides that draw on the expertise of a range of sources thanks to 

        digital media syndication. From the perspective of the museum and cultural 

        destination, this is an unparalleled opportunity to pre-market their cultural 

        assets as part of a syndication network, to encourage people to enter 

        their institutions as part of a wider city tour and discover new icons 

        and landmarks. </p>

      <p class=normal>The museum can now supply its audio commentary to cellular 

        phones and handheld devices, for example, as part of an 'information 

        on demand' network that tourists can use throughout a city or region. 

        This network would include not just cultural information, but practical 

        advice and suggestions on restaurants, hotels, theatres, transport, etc., 

        with each area of information covered by experts in the field.</p>

      <p class=normal>Antenna Audio has recently recorded an audio tour of central 

        London which combines information about exterior landmarks such as Trafalgar 

        Square and Nelson's Column with messages about artworks and the exhibition 

        program within the neighbouring National Gallery. The tour is designed 

        to lead tourists up the stairs of the National Gallery and into its exhibitions 

        and permanent collection. [Demonstration of a portion of this tour.]</p>

      <p class=normal>Currently, this audio tour can be heard on premium rate 

        phone lines connected to the uB-mobile WAP portal, making it a demonstration 

        of what will be possible via telematics rather than a practical and economical 

        source of cultural information for London right now. However by undertaking 

        such pilot projects. The telematics industry is an extremely stormy sea 

        at the moment with telcos, network providers, handset manufacturers and 

        content portals battling it out for market share. Antenna is attempting 

        to tread water in this shifting market by keeping tabs on the various 

        trends in the new media industry so that we are ready to take the audio 

        tour to the next stage as soon as technology and the market are ready.</p>
