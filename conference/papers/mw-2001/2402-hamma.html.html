      <h1 class="PaperTitle">A Top Level Museum Domain</h1>

      <h2 class="Author">Cary Karp, Swedish Museum of Natural History, Sweden, 

        Kenneth Hamma, J. Paul Getty Museum, USA</h2>

      <h1 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract:</h1>

      <p class=AbstractText>In November 2000 the Museum Domain Management Association 

        (MuseDoma) was awarded the opportunity of introducing a new top level 

        domain (TLD), museum. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and 

        Numbers (ICANN) approved seven applications for new domains at that time. 

        With the support of ICOM and the Getty Trust, MuseDoma expects to bring 

        this domain into operation the first week of July 2000 to benefit the 

        museum community world wide in the online environment. We explore here 

        a short history of the Internet and its naming conventions that led to 

        ICANN's actions, and look at the potential benefits to the museum 

        community of a museum TLD.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Keywords: ICANN, ICOM, Getty, Karp, Hamma, TLD, top

      <p class=normal>May I first note: the printed version of this paper was 

        submitted two months ago on January 15. Significant changes in the since 

        then will be reflected in the version delivered here today.</p>

      <p class=normal>By way of introduction, I would like to start with a little 

        history of Internet technology management -- at least as understood 

        by a classical archaeologist such as myself. This may be far too elementary 

        for many of you, and may be fully unknown for others coming from parts 

        of the museum community that are able to focus on content rather than 

        connectivity issues. I think it is essential to have some common sense 

        of the short history of the internet and how that history has been characterized 

        by radical change before jumping into the murky waters of expectations 

        for the future with new TLDs, in particular with the museum TLD. Following 

        this I will tell you what we understand to be the latest on various fronts. 

        And this will likely differ from any previously submitted version of this 

        paper since we are involved here in a process that brings weekly changes 

        and has not yet come to conclusion. Finally, because this covers such 

        a vast scope of issues and developments arising from museums as well as 

        the Internet, I want to leave a good space of time to answer questions.</p>

      <h1>What is DNS?</h1>

      <p class=normal>There is something we use everyday called the Domain Name 

        System (<a href="http://www.iana.org/" target="new">http://www.iana.org/domain-names.htm</a> 

        <a

name="_Hlt503575847"></a><a name="_Hlt503575749"></a><a name="_Hlt503575685"></a> 

        ), created in the Internet's precursor, ARPANET (the Department of 

        Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), to handle the 

        easily recognized names we use on the internet daily, etoys.com, for example, 

        and to map those names to unique IP addresses, which many of you are also 

        familiar with as a period-delimited set of four integers, 153.10.96.5, 

        for example. This system began life pretty much as it is today but with 

        a single person the administrator of names, Jon Postel, who eventually 

        handed those duties off first to SRI International and then to IANA, the 

        Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. At the outset the system supported 

        several generic top level domains or gTLDs and a set of about 200 two-letter 

        country-code top level domains, or ccTLDs. These designations are on the 

        first level, the farthest to the right in a URL.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Domain Name System is maintained exclusively as an enforceable 

        scheme on a set of Root Servers (<a

href="http://www.wia.org/pub/rootserv.html" target="new">http://www.wia.org/pub/rootserv.html</a> 

        <a

name="_Hlt503575766"></a><a name="_Hlt503575773"></a> ) which have a part to play 

        in every bit that travels across the Net. In order to ensure consistency, 

        the primary name set is created at Root Server A, run by Network Solutions 

        Incorporated for the National Science Foundation. This name set if periodically 

        propagated to the other root servers.</p>

      <p class=normal>The generic domains (<a

href="http://www.iana.org/gtld/gtld.htm" target="new">http://www.iana.org/gtld/gtld.htm</a> 

        <a

name="_Hlt503606051"></a><a name="_Hlt503606140"></a> ) are mostly well known 

        like .com, .net, .org. Note here the restrictions on the edu TLD: "reserved 

        for educational institutions in the United States granting four-year degrees." 

        These restrictions were not recently created but were part of the restricted 

        domain at its inception.</p>

      <p class=normal>The country codes (<a

href="http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm" target="new">http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm</a> 

        <a

name="_Hlt503606236"></a><a name="_Hlt503086293"></a> ) are based on the ISO-3166 

        list of two-letter country codes. These have been variously managed or 

        completely neglected since their inception. Some, such as TV, have been 

        heavily marketed by their owners in the last year as useful letter combinations 

        that have nothing to do with their countries. And based on the success 

        of that marketing effort, we are now seeing additional ccTLDs, such as 

        LA.</p>

      <p class=normal>In 1991-92 the National Science Foundation (NSF) undertook 

        coordinating and funding the management of the non-military portion of 

        the Internet. In 1992 NSF contracted with Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) 

        to provide many of the services (hence NSI's current ownership of 

        RootServer A) and, just as significantly if not more so, was granted by 

        Congressional statute the authority to provide for commercial activity 

        on NSFNET.</p>

      <p class=normal>With the explosion of Net activity in the 90s this theretofore 

        closely held 'research Net' suddenly became a very heavily used 

        and widely distributed 'commercial Net' expected to accommodate 

        much more. The distance between the two quickly became an arena for lots 

        of complaints. The most visible because they had <span class="Normal">a 

        clear and ever present effect on end-users were complaints about band-width. 

        Less visible but perhaps more urgent were complaints about management 

        and governance:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">widespread dissatisfaction with non-competitive 

          domain name registration</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">use of name issues, primarily conflicts between 

          trademark holders and domain name holders</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">lack of mechanisms for resolving these use-of-name 

          conflicts, and existing ones being expensive and cumbersome</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">commercial interests, staking their future on 

          the successful growth of the Internet, calling loudly and with a lot 

          of capital for a more formal and robust management structure</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">quickly growing population of Internet users 

          outside the United States who wanted to participate in Internet coordination</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">with greater commercialization, it becomes less 

          appropriate for U.S. research agencies to direct and fund these functions</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">In 1996, John Postel, the author of 

        the initial proposal for the DNS, proposed expanding the name space. His 

        initial proposal was large and far-reaching. But with increasing commercial 

        value in names and in some quarters concern for the scalability of the 

        DNS, the decision to add new top-level domains was quickly reigned in. 

        After review by many agencies and the solicitation of much public comment, 

        the scope of the proposal was greatly reduced. It continued however with 

        several of the original goals:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">expanded name space with new TLDs such as .info, 

          .nom, .store</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">tightening up of enforcement or rules, such 

          as those that apply to .edu</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">open competition world-wide for domain registrations</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">less US government activity/funding in management 

          of the Internet</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">This led more or less directly to the 

        process that the museum TLD has been involved</span> in since last August.</p>

      <p class=normal>As you know the application that was submitted for the museum 

        TLD was submitted to ICANN (<a href="http://www.icann.org/" target="new">http://www.icann.org/</a>), 

        the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. It was submitted 

        on October 2 and decisions on new TLDs were announced at ICANN's 

        board meeting on November 16, 2000.</p>

      <h1>What is ICANN? Where did it come from?</h1>

      <p class=normal>Beginning in May 1997 and continuing to the November 1998 

        Memorandum of Understanding (<a

href="http://www.icann.org/general/icann-mou-25nov98.htm" target="new">http://www.icann.org/general/icann-mou-25nov98.htm</a> 

        <a

name="_Hlt504194031"></a> ) between ICANN and the US Department of Commerce the 

        DoC created ICANN as a non-governmental agency to take over its Internet 

        management affairs. This is in many ways the end result of the initial 

        adoption of Internet coordination through NSF. The change involved primarily 

        the transfer and consolidation of authority for Internet governance in 

        ICANN which is composed of a board of directors, an at-large membership 

        and a string of supporting organizations. During the last three years, 

        the Internet world has seen a significant changes in the management of 

        the affairs of the Internet along these lines. The current re-assignment 

        of the Canadian ccTLD from the University of British Columbia to the Canadian 

        Internet Registration Authority, a government agency, is similar if on 

        the opposite public-private axis. All of these developments are not without 

        continuing challenges and difficulties, including fundamental questions 

        about the Department of Commerce's ability to have created ICANN 

        initially. So the process of creating ICANN continues as a current process. 

        And it is important that this be understood since it is having some impact 

        on the more visible process -- creating new TLDs.</p>

      <p class=normal>At the ICANN meeting in Yokohama in July of 2000, the discussion 

        of new TLDs got underway in earnest, being the only agenda topic aside 

        from organizing the at-large membership.</p>

      <p class=normal>A useful graph with detailed timeline of these governance 

        developments beginning in 1994 is available online at the World Internetworking 

        Alliance (<a href="../../../external.gif?link=http://www.wia.org/pub/dns_governance_timeline.gif" target="new">http://www.wia.org/pub/dns_governance_timeline.gif</a> 

        <a

name="_Hlt503607623"></a><a name="_Hlt503607598"></a> ). You can see there the 

        ICANN meetings beginning at the eleventh hour. But the changes that have 

        taken place in the last few years -- at least one aspect of them -- 

        is cogently expressed in two images that have been posted at the World 

        Internetworking Alliance:</p>

      <h1>Where did the .museum initiative start?</h1>

      <p class=normal>Cary Karp (<a href="http://home.pi.se/karp/">home.pi.se/karp/</a>) 

        was at the ICANN meeting in Yokohama, listening in, schmoozing, learning, 

        and advocating for the cultural heritage sector. And much to his surprise 

        .museum was mooted by others at the Yokohama meetings as the sort of thing 

        that the ICANN board envisioned and thought appropriate for the expansion 

        of the name space, particularly in the arena that has come to be called 

        special purpose TLDs. (The special purpose TLDs that were approved by 

        ICANN include .aero and .coop as well as .museum.)</p>

      <p class=normal>Partly out of consulting with the International Council 

        of Museums (ICOM) for many years, partly out of strong personal commitment 

        (<a

href="http://www.remunere.net/" target="new">www.remunere.net</a>), Cary had been 

        thinking about a top level domain that would serve the museum community, 

        and more broadly the cultural heritage community since the expansion of 

        the name space was proposed in 1996. The cumulative result of that, including 

        listserves and lots of comment from around the world, can be found on 

        this site: REMUNERE, Registry of Museum Network Resources. ICOM early 

        on was recognized as the only possible partner and policy companion for 

        such an effort, being the only world-wide NGO representing the interests 

        of museums. The ICOM definition of museum remains a key element of policy 

        for the .museum initiative. We may want to return to that later because 

        of its pivotal role, but also because of the implications of .museum for 

        the ICOM task force that oversees the 'maintenance' of the definition. 

        In general I do not expect that the policy street from ICOM is or will 

        be a one-way street since the growth of the importance of online resources 

        in all sectors will certainly motivate changes in the scope and purpose 

        of all such international representative organizations.</p>

      <p class=normal>During the summer of 2000 at the Getty, after many discussions 

        of the potential value of a museum domain, we decided that we thought 

        it an effort well worth supporting. A quick and non-scientific poll of 

        colleagues seemed to confirm that feeling. That was the last week of July 

        2000. The next week, first week of August 2000, I was in Santa Fe (<a

href="http://santafeopera.org/index2.php">http://santafeopera.org/index2.php</a>) 

        on vacation connected to email through a cell phone. So at 9600Kbps Cary 

        and I were put in touch with each other by Kathleen McDonnell and quickly 

        discovered that the common interest in a museum domain was a good thing, 

        that is non-competitive, and that details could and would be eventually 

        worked out.</p>

      <p class=normal>The week after that, the second week of August, ICANN finally 

        posted the forms and rules for applications (<a

href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-applications-15aug00.htm" target="new">http://www.icann.org/tlds/tld-applications-15aug00.htm</a>) 

        for new TLDs with a deadline for applications only six weeks away at the 

        beginning of October. One week later, the third week of August, we all 

        met in Ottawa at the CIDOC meeting to strategize and make specific plans 

        for creating, writing, reviewing and submitting the complex eight-part 

        application due a month later. September was full of those activities 

        in Stockholm, Paris, Los Angeles and Geneva leading up to the application 

        submission on the second of October. Key in our thinking was maintaining 

        this effort as one made on behalf of the museum community, and as one 

        that could eventually be expanded to include other cultural heritage sectors, 

        depending on what the first round of new TLD applications looked like. 

        We did think that there might have been an application on behalf of libraries.</p>

      <p class=normal>There has been some misunderstanding about the role of ICOM 

        (<a href="http://www.icom.org/" target="new">www.icom.org</a>), as there 

        has been about the role of the Getty in this. More about that in a minute. 

        But it is important to note here the critical role the ICOM plays, the 

        eagerness with which they have embraced that role and their generosity 

        in helping during the critical early months of the initiative. ICOM is 

        affiliated with UNESCO but was created as an independent NGO in 1946. 

        It currently h<span class="Normal">as about 15,000 institutional and individual

      <h1>Who owns the museum TLD?</h1>

      <p class=normal>As part of the application process for a museum TLD, the 

        Getty and ICOM became founder members of a new non-profit organization 

        (<b><a href="http://www.museduma.org/" target="new">http://www.musedoma.org</a>)</b> 

        incorporated in the state of Delaware and registered in the US as a 501(c)6. 

        There are good reasons based on the quantity of United States case law 

        for Internet governance and disputes to be incorporated in the US. We 

        can come back to this too, if anyone wants to ask additional questions 

        about the US incorporation. This does not mean that operations need be 

        or is envisioned to be in the US. In fact, most activity now is in Stockholm 

        and Paris. And so the Museum Domain Management Association -- not 

        Getty and not ICOM -- was the sponsor of the museum TLD application, 

        and the Museum Domain Management Association -- not Getty and not 

        ICOM -- is the trustee of the domain.</p>

      <p class=normal>MuseDoma, for short, will have other members, both museum 

        and non-museums, though only museum representatives may be elected to 

        board seats. MuseDoma has a board of six seats: two belong to ICOM and 

        the bylaws see that in perpetuity, two belong to the Getty and the expectation 

        is that those will be released when we are satisfied the MuseDoma has 

        achieved stable independence, two are empty. The primary responsibility 

        of the organization is to be the trustee of the museum domain and to set 

        policy that affects its operation in serving the world-wide community 

        which MuseDoma was founded to represent.</p>

      <p class=normal>A 501(c)6 organization is a non-profit trade association, 

        that is it exists to serve its non-profit members; and as a non-profit 

        itself, revenue can only be used to support the goals and purposes of 

        the association.</p>

      <p class=normal>Other current affiliates include:</p>

      <p class=normal>CORE (<a name="_Hlt503662429"></a><a

href="http://www.corenic.org/" target="new">www.corenic.org</a>) , the Internet 

        Council of Registrars, who is proposed at the technical registry. CORE 

        is also a not-for-profit membership organization which would like to provide 

        a shared name registration system, and</p>

      <p class=normal>The Swedish Museum of Natural History (<a

href="http://www.nrm.se/" target="new">http://www.nrm.se/welcome.html.se</a>), 

        which is currently providing in-kind support through overhead costs, staff 

        and services.</p>

      <p class=normal>Continuing the spirit of the Internet, all documents to 

        date are available -- and have been available through the duration 

        of this process on MuseDoma's Web site, (<a href="http://www.musedoma.org/" target="new">www.musedoma.org</a>). 

        These include the entire application to ICANN, the incorporation papers 

        and bylaws of MuseDoma, and all supporting and related documents.</p>

      <p class=normal>These Web pages also include a set of Frequently Asked Questions 

        (<a href="http://www.musedoma.org/faq.html" target="new">http://www.musedoma.org/faq.html</a>) 

        that are added to and updated periodically.</p>

      <p class=normal>There is as well (<a name="_Hlt503662794"></a><a

href="http://listserv.musedoma.org/archives/musedoma-questions.html">http://listserv.musedoma.org/archives/musedoma-questions.html</a>) 

        an on-going discussion of topics. In short there is a lot of information 

        here. There is the latest information here. And here again, let me say 

        we are involved in a process for which, given ICANN's own history, 

        even the parameters may change weekly.</p>

      <p class=normal>We hope and expect that MuseDoma will be a financially viable 

        and financially independent corporation within two years of accepting 

        registrations.</p>

      <h1>Now what?</h1>

      <p class=normal>In the emails that have arrived and in the discussions that 

        have ensued after the ICANN meeting in November, three questions have 

        come up with some frequency.</p>

      <h1>When can I register in the museum domain?</h1>

      <p class=normal>ICANN suggested last November that the new TLDs would have 

        their contracts with ICANN in place by the end of 2000 -- or that 

        at least the first of these would be in place. It is important to recall 

        here the recent history of the creation of ICANN and the governance changes 

        that are taking place. This is among the things that has considerable 

        slowed the process of contract negotiation. Assuming that this will be 

        resolved and not continue to delay the process of rolling out the new 

        TLDs, MuseDoma is aiming for initial registrations the first week of July 

        2001 in conjunction with the triennial ICOM meeting in Barcelona. One 

        need not be at the meeting to register, obviously. </p>

      <p class=normal>The motivation for this conjunction with the ICOM meeting 

        is important however. Given current facility to market to museums, it 

        is relatively easy to reach EU and North American museums. Exceptionally 

        strong and active national associations exist in the US, Canada and the 

        UK. It is more difficult to effectively reach museums elsewhere; in some 

        parts of the world exceedingly more difficult. And in the long-term value 

        we see for the domain, it is exactly those museums -- the difficult 

        to reach, the barely visible -- which we want most to reach, for which 

        we want most to create a welcoming community online and for which we want 

        to help provide visibility.</p>

      <h1>Can I register <i>mymuseum.museum</i>? What are the naming conventions 

        proposed?</h1>

      <p class=normal>The primary criterion for registration is being a museum 

        by the ICOM definition (<a href="http://www.icom.org/statutes.html" target="new">http://www.icom.org/statutes.html</a> 

        <a

name="_Hlt503605407"></a> ), as well as the many professionals and professional 

        membership associations that serve the museum community. Membership in 

        ICO<span class="Normal">M or any other professional or regional organization 

        is not a criterion for registration.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">"A museum is a non-profit making, permanent

        research, education or training."</span></p>

      <p class=normal>Virtual museums (<a

href="http://www.diarioelpais.com/muva2/" target="new">http://www.diarioelpais.com/muva2/</a>) 

        like this one run by Alicia Haber in Montevideo are not specifically included 

        in the current ICOM definition -- and must be considered viable registrants 

        in the museum domain. This is a discussion that ICOM is having now, and 

        one example of the ways in which the domain will likely impact this arena 

        of policy.</p>

      <p class=normal>We would like to permit institutions to register on the 

        second level -- next to the left from the first level -- but see 

        no viable scheme for this at the moment. I expect museums will be able 

        to request second level names at the outset, but we will register individual 

        institution names on the third level with all second-level designations 

        being generic or regional. We can see that .org on the second level would 

        be useful, also some designation for virtual museums; and registrants 

        may propose additional second level names which if adopted would be available 

        for all registrants.</p>

      <p class=normal>We are also aware of the proposals for multilingual character 

        sets in the Domain Name System and expect that the museum domain will 

        be among the early adopters of non-Latin character sets to work in parallel 

        with each other and with the Latin, museum.</p>

      <p class=normal>We have not set aside nor yet see the need to set aside 

        any reserved strings. But, in order to make sense of the domain, registered 

        names for museums will have to have their origin in corresponding organizational 

        names and locations.</p>

      <h1>What is the value of a museum TLD?</h1>

      <p class=normal>This is a question that each of us will answer for ourselves. 

        It reminds me a little of a moment years ago. A small and arcane group 

        I belonged to -- PhD candidates in Art History at Princeton -- 

        would get together now and then for a pot-luck supper. A student from 

        Cuba volunteered every time to bring menudo, but had the grace to ask 

        first if the rest of the group liked tripe. As surveys go, that was an 

        easy question. The surprising part was that opinions varied.</p>

      <p class=normal>I expect opinions will vary on the value of the museum domain. 

        But I also see that it is not one of the easy questions. If you read through 

        the comments made on the museum TLD on the MuseDoma Web site (<a

href="http://listserv.musedoma.org/archives/musedoma-questions.html">http://listserv.musedoma.org/archives/musedoma-questions.html</a>) 

        or on the ICANN Web site (<a

href="http://forum.icann.org/cgi-bin/rpgmessage.cgi?tldapps;39DF9FE000000010">http://forum.icann.org/tldapps/</a>) 

        , where you can read also about the other new TLDs, the extent to which 

        we are involved in something new and the extent to which that elicits 

        predictable emotions quickly becomes clear. At the same time I readily 

        admit that in proposing the domain we were acting with a certain set of 

        assumptions and with a certain view of museums world wide that not everyone 

        will necessarily share. </p>

      <p class=normal>Where is the value to museum audiences?</p>

      <p class=normal>I think it is in the potential for greater visibility of 

        museums online, thus facilitating the communications and educational missions 

        of museums world wide. Visibility will be enhanced greatly by a common 

        naming scheme in a single domain, rather than as is the case now, being 

        scattered across several of the top level domains. This is not to say 

        that multiple alternate names will not continue to exist for many museums; 

        I expect that will happen for lots of good reasons. This consolidation 

        may seem like a small thing for the National Gallery in London or the 

        Ameican Museum of Natural History, but these institutions are not typical 

        of the museum community in terms of Web activity. Visibility will also 

        be facilitated through enhanced WHOIS and DNS services which MuseDoma 

        can take beyond the services traditionally supported. Beginning with additional 

        information gathered in the registration process we expect to be able 

        to greatly increase the precision and recall of searches for museums online.</p>

      <p class=normal>Because the museum domain is restricted this visibility 

        will translate also to recognizability and the general realm of authenticity. 

        There are, it seems to me, two issues here that revolve around the ability 

        to be sure you are where you think you are with a Web address.</p>

      <p class=normal>One has to do with the difficulty to being sure there is 

        a one-to-one match in every Web browser's (I mean the person) expectation 

        between the URL and the institution it purports to represent. Some of 

        you may have never encountered the situation where name appropriation 

        is done specifically to divert Web traffic because of the value of that 

        name in the offline world. But I can assure you it happens often on a 

        large scale to large institutions and with less frequency and perhaps 

        with a more local intention to smaller public institutions. I could provide 

        lots of examples based solely on Getty where the insistent provider of 

        a .xxx site -- at the time of the opening of the museum in 1997 -- 

        sought out version of a jpaulgetty address which we had not already registered.</p>

      <p class=normal>The other has to do with the use of trademarked names, or 

        names close to trademarked names, that are shared. Again there are lots 

        of Getty examples since we share that part of our name with many individuals, 

        many smaller companies, and two large companies: one of which deals in 

        oil with which there is seldom serious confusion, and one of which deals 

        in image licensing with which there is probably more frequent confusion 

        in Web browsers' minds (people, again) than we appreciate.</p>

      <p class=normal>It is clear in my mind that the more we can do to create 

        visibility and recognizability in the online environment for museums the 

        better.</p>

      <p class=normal>Where is the value to the museum community and its individual 

        members?</p>

      <p class=normal>Some of the above goes directly also to this question. But 

        this leads also to the value-added services that the museum domain hopes 

        to be able to deliver. First on my list here is the mere existence of 

        the museum domain. We expected that this would begin to increase the sense 

        of community in the online environment for museums. Response so far strongly 

        suggests that this is the case, and that by creating a locus for that 

        community we may be able to target a set of concerns about being online 

        that neither money nor software are able to. We are anxious to see how 

        this will develop and are hopeful that it will contribute in this intangible 

        way to help bridge the so-called digital divide that exists for thousands 

        of museums and exponentially larger numbers of online visitors. Those 

        among you who have dealt with similar visitor or audience profile issues 

        will already have an appreciation for this. Among the most frequently 

        recurring of reasons for not visiting a museum from the traditionally 

        non-museum-visiting se<span class="Normal">gments of population in Los 

        Angeles is that they do not perceive museums as places they may go. They 

        expect not to be welcome. They expect not to know how to behave. They 

        expect to feel foreign. I believe we have an opportunity to mitigate that 

        online for institutions as well as their audiences.</span></p>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">Each museum, too will find its own 

        value in its own time in the museum TLD. But MuseDoma, as the trustee 

        of the domain, will act proactively and will be able to initiate value-added 

        services for its registrants. We have had only preliminary discussion 

        of what these might be, but you might imagine the field is both broad 

        and well-directed since MuseDoma will operate as a non-profit in the services 

        of its constituents. We could:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">waive registration fees for museums with operating 

          budgets under a certain amount</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">provide basic, limited Web hosting</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">provide simple Web site management tools</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">provide reference services for museum needs from vocabulary 

          standards to professional organizations</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">at the request of registrants provide regional or global 

          services such as self-serve calendar facilities</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class=normal><span class="Normal">and so on. While it is true that this 

        envisions something of a progressive redistribution to benefit th</span>e 

        less Web-enfranchised museums, it also begins to imagine a model in which 

        this domain can think locally with museums and their associations around 

        the world, and then act globally in ways that benefit the entire community.</p>
