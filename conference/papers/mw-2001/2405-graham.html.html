      <p class=PaperTitle>A Curatorial Resource for Upstart Media Bliss</p>

      <p class=Author>Beryl Graham and Sarah Cook, University of Sunderland, UK</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Using resources gathered for the CRUMB website (<a href="http://www.newmedia.sunderland.ac.uk/crumb/" target="new">http://www.newmedia.sunderland.ac.uk/crumb/</a>), 

        this paper presents some key information and debates regarding the curating 

        of new media art, both on the web and in conventional gallery spaces. 

        Including quotes from Sarah Diamond, Steve Dietz, Peter Weibel, Benjamin 

        Weil and Kathy Rae Huffman, the paper discusses issues of how artists 

        are paid, how new media art is archived, how audiences might respond to 

        new media art, and the aesthetics concerning the presentation of new media 

        genres. Practical examples from the authors' experience of curating 

        new media art are also given.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText><b>Keywords:</b> new media art, curating, interactive 

        art, net art, audience.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Museums consider having web presence as obligatory -- 

        as membership, information, e.commerce, etc. and then eventually an art 

        space. The art space is not quite an afterthought, but it is not the prime 

        focus.<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> (Weil, Sins of Change 2000)</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>... the Susan Collins artwork <i>Audio Zone</i> is 

        spread around the exhibition space. The audience must wear infra-red headphones, 

        which at certain points receive seductive voices urging you to 'touch' 

        and 'stroke' the triggered video projections of nipples, lips 

        and keyboard buttons. The desk staff who issue the headphones quickly 

        noticed a very common misconception in the audience, and now carefully 

        explain to each person that this is NOT 'a guide to the exhibition.' <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Graham, 1994)</p></p>

      <p class=normal>The problem with curating new media art is that the fascinating 

        range of challenges is matched only by the dearth of data and material 

        available to help curators. Comparatively, the field of museum interpretative 

        and educational new media is well resourced and debated. On seeing a piece 

        of new technology in a gallery or museum, a member of the public is justifiably 

        likely to assume that it is some kind of interpretative aid rather than 

        an artwork in itself.</p>

      <p class=normal>General new media theory seems to be in plentiful supply; 

        so much so, that the few accomplished new media artworks which manage 

        to get produced tend to emerge staggering under the weight of eager academics. 

        When it comes to the practical issues of presenting new media to the public, 

        however, even Peter Weibel of ZKM admits that it is "difficult not to 

        make an error because there is not much information ..." (Weibel, 2000). 

        There have been some conferences and some skirmishing on discussion lists 

        concerning new media art curating in particular, but nothing like the 

        regular, archived, published events devoted to the web as interpretation.</p>

      <p class=normal>It is this relative absence which the Curatorial Resource 

        for Upstart Media Bliss attempts to address, starting with the collection 

        and presentation of some pithy information and opinion relevant to overworked 

        new media curators. CRUMB forages beneath the tables of education, museum 

        evaluation and media theory for tasty morsels, as well as going straight 

        to the horses' mouths of curators and artists for useful experience 

        and hindsight. The website includes bibliographies, links, interviews 

        with leading curators, and some useful nitty-gritty concerning contracts, 

        etc. The CRUMB website, and this paper, draw from a wider research interest 

        in new media curating at the University of Sunderland, and particularly 

        from the experience of the curators. Working both in new media and mixed 

        visual arts contexts, between us we have experience in working with budgets 

        from £200 to £200,000, and in doing research in places from Banff and 

        Minneapolis to Bangalore and Ljubljana. Having worked with institutions 

        from artists-run centres to local authority galleries, we have sympathy 

        with various devils, and can commiserate with Barbara London when she 

        says that "It's tough to get museums to change, to keep moving in new 

        directions. In early days of video we didn't have access-- parcel 

        post is how they got around."<i> (</i>Sins of Change 2000).</p>

      <p class=normal>It is very much early days for any discussion of new media 

        art curatorship. At times the debate seems to move very fast, and at others 

        it seems fossilized, with huge disparities in awareness and expectations. 

        In Britain in 1997, the announcement of the Turner Prize nominees unleashed 

        a surprising flood of popular press puzzlement that video could be considered 

        to be art. On the other hand, in India, a healthily hybrid approach means 

        that artists like Shilpa Gupta (<a href="http://members.tripod.com/shilpagupta/">http://members.tripod.com/shilpagupta/</a>) 

        can move between sculptural installation and Internet-based art fairly 

        comfortably. The field of 'new', new-ish or upstart media is 

        rather difficult to discuss when neither the terminology nor the genres 

        are fixed. The conference <i>Computing Culture: Defining New Media Genres 

        </i>(1998) suggested that artefacts could be considered within the genres 

        of Database, Interface, Spatialization and Navigation. Festivals and institutions 

        do seem to be starting to divide their calls for work into rough categories 

        of Net.Art, Single Screen, Performative, and some variety of interactive 

        or non-interactive Installation (Public Art and 2D Digital Images being 

        occasional orbiting companions). Whilst net.art has netted the majority 

        of debate and controversy, CRUMB also covers physical new media works 

        in conventional gallery spaces.</p>

      <p class=normal>This paper uses some resources from the CRUMB website to 

        consider some current debates for curating new media art, falling under 

        four headings: Artists, Archives, Audiences, and Aesthetics.</p>

      <h1>Artists</h1>

      <p class=BlockQuote>His idea was clear: a museum has to follow what artists 

        are doing. Art history has to follow art. Not the opposite. Too much today 

        the museum wants to prescribe what art is. <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Weibel 

        ,2000, referring to Alfred H. Barr of MOMA)</p></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Curatorial decisions are made through a need to justify 

        hardware and software investments. Artists are a test case. <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Vuk 

        Cosic, net.art pioneer, Sins of Change 2000)</p></p>

      <p class=normal>Art and science institutions have sometimes invited artists 

        in to play with their equipment, only to find them fundamentally challenging 

        their whole value systems:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>[new media art] practice challenges the notion of authorship, 

        has to do with collective authorship; non western ideas of discourse is 

        something the museum has always had trouble with. And what has happened 

        on the net is a brain of a social collectivity, that allows discursive 

        practice ... How do you support and preserve a critical practice that 

        is inclusive ... how can you do that when it is difficult to pin down 

        authorship? <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Sara Diamond, Banff Centre 

        for the Arts, Sins of Change 2000)</p></p>

      <p class=normal>Artists, whether individually or collectively, have not 

        only presented museums with major conceptual headaches, but also been 

        implicated in major shifts in how educational and commercial research 

        institutions think about what they do. As Lynn Hershman says: "digital 

        artists have to adopt interdisciplinary ways of researching" (Sins of 

        Change 2000), not least in order to get access to equipment. In the USA, 

        for example, the Xerox PARC experience (Harris, 1999) openly explores 

        the creative conflicts between art and science research, whilst in the 

        UK the development of 'art-practice-led' PhDs has been involved 

        with a fundamental questioning of 'what is research?' (Malins 

        and Gray, 1999). It is the artists who make and push the new forms of 

        media art, even if these forms are risky, challenging or an unfinished 

        process: "... only the net allows us to make these works in progress. 

        If you are a curator it is a crime not to use it." (Olia Lialina, net.art 

        pioneer, Sins of Change 2000). Certain generous and brave curators have 

        benefited from the spirit of this openness by making their research trips 

        public (such as Barbara London's Japan journal <a href="http://media.moma.org/dot.jp/">http://media.moma.org/dot.jp/</a>) 

        or by sharing their process and knowledge (very notably, Steve Dietz's 

        publications at <a href="http://www.yproductions.com/" target="new">http://www.yproductions.com/</a>).</p>

      <p class=normal>Concerning audience, archiving and economics, artists tend 

        to ask the most difficult questions, such as Ester Robinson's queries: 

        "Who is paying for what you are doing? ... Does it live in a place 

        that no one should care about it? ...Who has ownership? ... How 

        does it give the audience sustenance?" <i>(Sins of Change</i>, 2000). 

        Of obvious importance to artists is the whole question of how they can 

        make a living. Olia Lialina has stated that "My contribution to this discussion 

        was the first net art gallery, Teleportica. It was to show that net artists 

        are not the cheapest artists on the market." <i>(Sins of Change,</i> 2000). 

        Should museums be paying 'per screening' like video or cinema,? 

        Should they be funding co-productions like films? How do web artists fit 

        into the Exhibition Payment Right (UK) or CARFAC schedules (Canada)? Media 

        artists can't survive</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>... unless museums start to pay artists fair amounts 

        for linking to their work... amounts that are comparable with what any 

        other artist showing in a gallery space in the museum would expect to 

        receive for a whole body of work... one net site is usually not the equivalent 

        to one painting ... more like a major body of work -- [such as] a 

        large installation, a substantial video, a series of sculptures. <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Rackham, 

        2000)</p></p>

      <p class=normal>Other artists may see the more popular debate concerning 

        payment and intellectual property as part of the commercialization of 

        the Internet rather than as an art debate per se (but these may, of course, 

        be artists with other sources of income):</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I'm always struck by how the mainstream press is obsessed 

        with the question of how Internet artists are ever going to make a buck 

        ... I recently plodded through stacks of reviews from the '60s of Fluxus 

        artists smashing violins and pissing in buckets. At the time plenty of 

        journalists asked 'Why is this art?' or 'Is it theater?' 

        or 'Is it any good?', but I never saw a single article that 

        raised the question of how these artists were going to make a living. 

        <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Ippolito, 2000)</p></p>

      <p class=normal>The struggle for artists' access to money, resources 

        and presentation facilities will no doubt continue, but as artists are 

        the ones who are making the debate as well as the work, they may be "a 

        test case" in a positive as well as a negative sense -- testing the 

        institutions in unpredictable and productive ways. </p>

      <h1>Archives</h1>

      <p class=BlockQuote>How can we address the preservation of ideas as opposed 

        to objects? <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Weil, 2000) </p></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Lev Manovich: I understand your position regarding museums, 

        art institutions, preserving, archiving, databasing -- but it's 

        so different from the Futurists who said, 'shoot the painters, burn 

        the museum.' Here we are -- the avant-garde -- and we want 

        to keep all the stuff. (...) Maybe we should be looking towards the 

        future.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Sara Diamond: "It's different when a canon is being 

        created, as opposed to a movement." <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Sins 

        of Change 2000)</p></p>

      <p class=normal>It seems that every media art festival of the past year 

        had a panel to address the question of archiving -- often as art (for 

        example, the panel at ISEA2000 moderated by Karen O'Rourke with Patricia 

        d'Isola, Christophe Le Francois, Eduardo Kac, Georges Legrady, and Lev 

        Manovich), but also as a curatorial strategy. Yet despite all the discussions 

        there remains an ambivalence toward the notion of archiving -- we 

        don't know what to keep yet, but we need to be able to refer to it.</p>

      <p class=normal>"We either let it decay online and that's fine or we preserve 

        the memory and find a form to represent it in a manner that makes sense. 

        Who in this room has seen the <i>Spiral Jetty</i>? But we all know about 

        it, at least we have a sense of what the intent was. Going backwards to 

        understand how this work was produced is a good lesson." (Weil, 2000).</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>... art critics have suddenly found pioneering figures 

        in video installation, all from the early 90s. There is in fact a half-century 

        of pioneers, and now we have to get the word out, not just the work out. 

        ... the genesis of this conference was to address the amnesia of recent 

        art critics. You must get up and think about them [the early media artists], 

        teach them, write about them, make people watch them. <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Bruce 

        Jenkins, film and video curator at Harvard University, Sins of Change 

        2000).</p></p>

      <p class=normal>Furthermore, we're aware that technologically, we're 

        using media which have, in Bruce Sterling's words, "the life-span 

        of a hamster" (1995). Showing the work in order to keep it alive, in order 

        to make it part of a canon, is in fact destroying the work. In the case 

        of film and video, the work is deteriorating as we watch and learn about 

        it.</p>

      <p class=normal>So, if we can't count on being able to keep the obsolescent 

        technology, we need to be able to keep the intent, the words. Yet the 

        question of archiving even the discourse which surrounds new media practice 

        (which we anticipate will be useful to future curators) is itself debated. 

        For every book published by MIT press, for example, there are a thousand 

        e-mails on listservs across the globe that get read and deleted. Jennifer 

        Crowe is constantly revising the guidelines for submissions of projects 

        and information to the Rhizome database (<a href="http://www.rhizome.org/" target="new">http://www.rhizome.org</a>). 

        Then there's the question of whether the discourse exists in the 

        first place:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>... people in art worlds didn't know how to look 

        at my work, or treat it. So I wrote my own reviews [under the pseudonym 

        of] Prudence Juris. The reviews would talk about and argue about the work. 

        Then I would take those articles and show them to the galleries to develop 

        my own credibility. You have to create the language yourself to promote, 

        historicize your work. Just doing the work isn't enough. You have to create 

        preservation on your own. <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Lynn Hershman, 

        artist, Sins of Change, 2000).</p></p>

      <p class=normal>E-mail has made even the museum tradition of filing correspondence 

        with artists more complicated (few people in the museum world are consistently 

        diligent enough to print and file a letter about the making or exhibiting 

        of even a painting, let alone the details of a web commission).</p>

      <p class=normal>The Walker and other museums have been questioning the feasibility 

        of offering open source, shared server space to artists. Oliver Grau at 

        the University of Humboldt in Berlin (<a href="http://www.arthist.hu-berlin.de/" target="new">http://www.arthist.hu-berlin.de</a>) 

        is developing a database of virtual art that documents not only the work 

        of art but also all its different versions, each time it was presented, 

        what the publicity/criticism of its exhibition was, even who the technicians 

        who worked on it were. This is an academic (and highly theoretical) endeavour, 

        but once online could be a model for the preservation of ideas as well 

        as of the documentation of inherently transitory work.</p>

      <p class=normal>This, after all, is the mandate of the ZKM. But on that 

        front there is also the curatorial dilemma of the authority of authoring 

        through the practice of archiving. How many future new media curators 

        will see the exhibition <i>net_condition</i> produced by the ZKM as the 

        official history of net.art? Why aren't Heath Bunting and Irational.org 

        in the show?</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>They [ZKM] had a show on Internet art -- I'd 

        like this to go on the record -- very, very late in the game. They 

        came very late to discover Internet art. They trailed on the coattails 

        of other curators. They picked up and accumulated the choices of other 

        curators. They accumulated them in their show.<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> 

        (Huffman, 2000)</p></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Sarah Cook: So then what is the future of a new media 

        curator?</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Peter Weibel: to protect media art against the takeover 

        of the historical art world. Seriously. It's not an easy job.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Sarah Cook: But the historical art world is founded 

        in part on museums where they collect art. That is why you have new media 

        institutions like the one we're in now, ZKM, which also collects, 

        so how is that protecting media art from the art world if museums the 

        world over are collecting new media art?</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Weibel: By two things. First by emphasizing production, 

        of contemporary, risky, young artists, and then by preserving the work 

        which is discounted and marginalized by the art institutions. <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Weibel, 

        2000).</p></p>

      <p class=normal>In the field of new media art, the canons are beginning 

        to appear amongst the hand -to-hand combat concerning archiving. Dust 

        may continue to obscure the view for some time, but if we archive documents 

        and records of the early exhibitions as well as recording the work itself, 

        the history of new media may perhaps be usefully retained. By utilising 

        the possibilities of new media, the archives may even be creative tools 

        in their own right.</p>

      <h1>Audience</h1>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Who wants to walk around a gallery if it's full 

        of toffee-nosed elitists? <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(James Bloom 

        of <i>Wired</i> magazine at the First UK Internet Art Festival, quoted 

        in Cavendish,1995, p. 23)</p></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>If interactive art simply mirrors the game -- its 

        themes and values -- it becomes symptomatic of uncritical postmodernism 

        where there is no difference between entertainment and art, where consumerism 

        reigns. And when, loaded down as amusement, it knocks on the museum door, 

        it insists on altering how and why museums function, further institutionalizing 

        art as consumer fun. (Cornwell, 1933, p. 12)</p>

      <p class=normal>In the early nineties, the utopian excitement about new 

        and different audiences contrasted sharply with fears that the allure 

        of 'hands-on technology fun' might be deeply implicated in the 

        'Disneyfication' of museums. Some time later, the debate is 

        perhaps less polarized, but still rather contradictory. Shankar Barua 

        (2000) summarised a situation that has international resonance: "In India 

        the audience for art galleries is a thin elite. The audience for new media 

        art is also an elite, but a different one."</p>

      <p class=normal>Is the audience for net.art a new audience or just the regular 

        art audience logging on when they should be doing something else? How 

        does the audience find the site? How does the number of hits to a website 

        relate to actual use, benefit and pleasure? Is it more about participation 

        than audience anyway? And how about 'hacktivist' net.art, which 

        may be deliberately anonymous and covert in its baiting of multinationals, 

        rather than seeking an audience? For all the internationalist rhetoric, 

        how does the Internet cope with the practicalities of cross-cultural art 

        communication? For all of these questions, certain exhibitions and artefacts 

        provide particular examples, but there is much less information available 

        from curators and artists about behind-the-scenes data, illuminating failures, 

        or audience feedback. Those who design museum interpretative sites have 

        been gathering information for some time on those who use the sites, how 

        and when. Artists may have very different parameters for judging the 'success' 

        of their sites, but some data on who visit, and whether they stay for 

        two seconds or two hours, might be useful, even if only to discover how 

        best to shock and appall. </p>

      <p class=normal>As for new media art installations displayed in conventional 

        gallery and museum spaces, there are some scattered items of information 

        concerning audience demographics. For example, for one exhibition of interactive 

        installations in a regional British art museum, the show, when compared 

        to other contemporary and historical art exhibitions in the same year, 

        showed little difference in gender numbers, but a significantly higher 

        proportion of visitors from the "under-20" age bracket (Graham, 1997, 

        p. 102).</p>

      <p class=normal>Gathering demographic information is one thing, but judging 

        the subtleties of audience interaction is another. The entry of new media 

        art into museums was very much spearheaded by 'the romance of interactivity':</p>

      <p class=normal>The word <i>interactive</i> sounds like it will alleviate 

        the alienation of modern life by generating a dynamic alliance between 

        artists and their audiences, joining them together in a splendid waltz 

        that lets viewers become equal partners with artists in creating art (Wooster, 

        1991, p. 294). Since then, the romance has been tempered by some more 

        critical views on exactly how interactive artefacts are: "For a multimedia 

        program, a human audience is just a random number generator." (Cubitt, 

        1999) The knowledge of those designing educational exhibits has also become 

        pertinent: "To interact is to act reciprocally, to act on each other. 

        ... not merely a machine that the visitor operates ... 'Non-interactive 

        mechanisms' perhaps sums them up adequately." (Miles, 1988, p.95). 

        Although artists are understandably wary of 'audience evaluation', 

        they may be interested in, for example, the results of Stevenson's 

        (1994) research into hands-on science exhibits which indicates that there 

        are significant impacts on the long-term memories and understanding of 

        the audience, rather than merely a case of 'running around pushing 

        things'.</p>

      <p class=normal>Some of the commentary on the audience's use of interactive 

        artworks in galleries has come from critics: "... you really need an hour 

        alone with the thing, which is impossible under the circumstances of everyday 

        museum attendance." (Coleman, 1994, p.14). Some has come from artists 

        themselves, such as David Rokeby's detailed observations on "command" 

        gestures versus "tentative questioning gestures" in his interactive art 

        systems (1995, p. 148). Weinbren (1995) and Feingold (1995, p.401) have 

        also made useful observations on 'control' and 'mastery' 

        in their own artworks. Research into interactive artworks in galleries 

        (Graham; 1997, 1999) expected interesting gender differences, but uncovered 

        instead a surprising tendency for groups to want to use artworks together, 

        even when this meant squashing uncomfortably into spaces designed for 

        an individual. This led to a particular interest in artworks which encourage 

        interaction between audience members, rather than solely between artwork 

        and audience.</p>

      <p class=normal>There is still a great deal of uncertainty amongst curators 

        (and the audience) as to what <i>kind</i> of experience is being offered 

        by new media art: Quick-fire game pleasure? Information pleasure? Sculptural 

        pleasure? Sit-on-a-hard-chair-and-watch-a-video pleasure? (Graham, 2001). 

        As with the <i>Audio Zone</i> artwork using infra-red headphones, this 

        confusion may be used creatively, but the incredibly diverse range of 

        expectations about new media art means that it's more than usually 

        important to try to get some kind of feedback. Matthew Gansallo (2000), 

        when interviewed about the Mongrel commission for the Tate (<a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/webart/" target="new">http://www.tate.org.uk/webart/</a>), 

        revealed a wide range of reactions:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>... we got a lot of responses back: 'who did 

        it?' and 'how scary!', and 'is this a site for knowledge?' 

        and 'what is it?' and 'anyone can put this typically Tate 

        shock tactics crap [up]!' And we got responses that were 'gosh 

        this is interesting,' and 'I'm glad they've done this,' 

        and 'it's good the Tate is large enough to say what you want.'</p>

      <p class=normal>Whoever the target audience for new media art may be, and 

        whatever the feedback, Robert Atkins has some pithy parting advice:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>"The Top Five strategies for overcoming sloth in your 

        artistic/curatorial practice in relation to the issue of having your audience 

        gain access to the work:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>5. Don't think technological barriers will fall -- 

        there are ever-increasing barriers of technology business ...</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>4. Focus your energy on technology that is beginning 

        to arise, something not too far away ...</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>3. Don't lose sight of producers and of quality for 

        audiences; the more you watch the less you know.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>2. Do think hybrid, not just hardware or software. Digital 

        culture can be simultaneously many things at once; producers and audiences 

        can both be content creators ... The art-world mix of producers [can create] 

        another form of knowledge -- from media into media art. <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(i.e.

      <h1>Aesthetics</h1>

      <p class=BlockQuote>User experience is what art does best. To change the 

        interface is to dramatically change the work. <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Lee 

        Manovich, artist and theorist, Sins of Change 2000)</p></p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>It's only under huge pressure that a visual arts curator 

        would agree to hang a video projector, and only if it is agreed the projector 

        will project an image on the wall and take us back to painting. Only under 

        threat of torture will a visual arts curator put a computer in the galleries. 

        <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Philippe Verge, Walker Art Center , Sins 

        of Change 2000)</p></p>

      <p class=normal>The aesthetics of new media art is easily ignored in favour 

        of its function. Moreover, the way a piece of new media art looks and 

        holds up within the realm of aesthetics is usually masked behind a whack 

        of media and communication theory -- about networks, about spectacle, 

        about invisible architectures. Aesthetics, as a philosophy, is an old-fashioned 

        one, and certainly not one taught in most media schools. It is, however, 

        a philosophy taught to curators. Hegel taught that to each age there is 

        an art form, from painting to sculpture to the architecture of the temple 

        itself; from this we learned not to see art as separate from the age in 

        which it was produced. New media's very nature -- interactivity 

        being one aspect -- has demanded of curators different criteria for 

        the aesthetic evaluation of the works. Would Hegel have placed net.art 

        as the highest art form for our age?</p>

      <p class=normal>In his article "The Death of Computer Art", Lev Manovich 

        (1996) made a distinction between two worlds where art is made and shown, 

        but where the social definitions of art differ enormously. The first he 

        called "Duchamp-land" and defined it as: "galleries, major museums, prestigious 

        art journals"; the second he called "Turing-land" and defined its parameters 

        as "ISEA, Ars Electronica, SIGGRAPH art shows, etc." Manovich's point 

        was that the two worlds would not converge, that we should not expect 

        what is being made in Turing-land to be shown in Duchamp-land. The reason 

        for this, he surmised, was that the typical object admitted to Duchamp-land 

        prioritizes content and fits within a discourse of irony, self-referentiality 

        and other things generally postmodern, but that the objects being made 

        in Turing-land are not ironic because they are oriented towards ever-new 

        technology rather than content, they are simple in ideas, and they take 

        their technology very seriously. </p>

      <p class=normal>This distinction is still valid. Manovich established criteria 

        for the type of art <i>accepted</i> in each land, but what he didn't 

        mention then, and what has become paramount now in 2001, are the criteria 

        for art to be <i>shown</i> in each land-- namely, the questions of 

        exhibition practices and the field of curatorship. For art to be shown 

        in Turing-land, it need only apply. All that is needed is some money, 

        a truck, a power-bar, a plug, a network connection plus a space in a fair 

        in a convention center, or maybe none of that but ftp and a server. For 

        art to be shown in Duchamp-land it has to have the interest of a curator, 

        and with that comes the backing of an institution, a board of directors, 

        a funding body, an intellectual mass. Unlike the art made in Turing-land, 

        art in Duchamp-land goes through some process of curatorial legitimization 

        before it is shown. Curators make regular visits to Turing-land in order 

        to find things to bring to Duchamp-land (that's how Lev Manovich 

        ended up in the Walker Art Center -- one of the powerhouses of Duchamp-land). 

        So in that respect, it might have very little to do with what the work 

        is actually about. While the two worlds may not have converged, the way 

        curators move between them has had an effect on the work being produced 

        in each. Where do you think curators have learned the communication theory 

        behind which they can hide the lackluster aesthetics of much of new media 

        art? What is found readymade in Turing-land can always be signed and exhibited 

        in Duchamp-land.</p>

      <p class=normal>And has this curatorial "research" had an effect on the 

        way the work is presented in each? You betcha. Curators beware: 'changing 

        interface' can change the work. One only has to think of the different 

        experience of visiting a convention center from visiting a white cube 

        to realize that the interface is the interaction. The same is the case 

        on the web -- seeing art in the context of a commercial product-based 

        site and seeing it in the context of a cultural content-based site can 

        drastically affect how that work is interpreted.</p>

      <p class=normal>The best recent example of this was Vivian Selbo's 

        design for the exhibition <i>Art Entertainment Network </i>(<a href="http://aen.walkerart.org/">http://aen.walkerart.org</a>). 

        Creating a customizable interface for the works on view was the artwork 

        in itself. There was a place to shop, a place to read, a place to listen, 

        a place to chat ... all things we expect from our web-experience, whether 

        commercial or cultural. These types of interfaces are clearly needed as 

        curators have recognized that Duchamp-land-type media art simply doesn't 

        fly in any place where its irony and content-based form is subsumed by 

        the pressures of the bottom line.</p>

      <p class=normal>Though who says aesthetic culture isn't commercial 

        anyway? Obviously it always has been. Nevertheless, the curating of media 

        art into Duchamp-land has caused a number of Turing-land artists to reconsider 

        how they want their work to evolve in the world. Why should it be self-referential 

        and postmodern just to get the money to be shown in Duchamp-land when 

        now they can get a lot more money by masking the irony and selling their 

        skills to the market (which is neither Duchamp nor Turing aware) instead? 

        As such, a number of web-based artists have turned the lion's share 

        of their attention away from simply making works of net.art to starting 

        dot.coms: Vuk Cosic and the Slovenian start-up Literal (<a href="http://www.literal.si/" target="new">http://www.literal.si</a>), 

        the boys from etoy selling shares as art (<a href="http://www.etoy.com/" target="new">http://www.etoy.com</a>), 

        hans_extrem and his self-professed very expensive consulting company, 

        Ubermorgen (<a href="http://www.ubermorgen.com/" target="new">http://www.ubermorgen.com</a>).</p>

      <p class=normal>This has created a third problem and brings us back to the 

        beginning of the vicious circle. How do curators present this type of 

        overtly commercial and yet slyly Duchampian practice when museums structures 

        have traditionally dictated that the art shown is not explicitly commercial, 

        and when at the same time the commercial galleries won't touch new 

        media art with a ten-foot pole because they can't see its inherent 

        ephemerality as an investment? Should they even exhibit it? Until Turing-land 

        and Duchamp-land (and now perhaps Monopoly-land) get themselves sorted 

        out, the answer seems to be that curators tend to go back to their philosophies 

        of aesthetics and mask the work behind more theory: beauty with seduction 

        always sells.</p>

      <h1>In Conclusion</h1>

      <p class=normal>The reason curators expose themselves to the confusion and 

        challenge (and carping) of newmedia art might be that the whole mess is 

        undeniably fascinating and offers opportunities for trying a bold experiment,and 

        getting it right (or more right than anyone so far). CRUMB aims to provide 

        some information which might help avoid the alternative of getting it 

        spectacularly wrong (in a way that someone else has previously got it 

        wrong). We aim to extend the life-span of the media art hamster by filling 

        our cheeks with crumbs dropped by curators and others, and all thanks 

        should go to those who share the knowledge (Steve Dietz and Sara Diamond 

        particularly), and to all those who agreed to be interviewed about awkward 

        subjects.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Museums and the Web conference is one of the few occasions 

        on which educators and archivists get to meet artists and art curators 

        and to share information from their varied experience. We hope that people 

        will contribute to the CRUMB site and discussion list, and add to the 

        public body of knowledge concerning new media curating.</p>
