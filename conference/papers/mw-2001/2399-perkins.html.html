      <p class=PaperTitle>A New Way of Making Cultural Information Resources Visible 

        on the Web: Museums and the Open Archives Initiative</p>

      <p class=Author>John Perkins, CIMI Consortium, Canada</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Museums hold enormous amounts of information in collections 

        management systems and publish academic and scholarly research in print 

        journals, exhibition catalogues, virtual museum presentations, and community 

        publications. Much of this rich content is unavailable to web search engines 

        or otherwise gets lost in the vastness of the World Wide Web. The Open 

        Archives Initiative (OAI) has developed an easily implemented protocol 

        to enable data providers to expose their information and service providers 

        to access and use it. The CIMI Consortium is working with the OAI to make 

        it possible for museums to enhance the availability of their research 

        resources, allowing them to be discovered in Web-space by the specialist 

        audiences for which they are intended or by service providers who collect, 

        distribute or in other ways provide access. By building on the OAI protocol, 

        Dublin Core, and museum community XML developments, significant advancements 

        can be made in exposing museum information resources. This paper introduces 

        the OAI and its protocol, explores its potential relevance to museums, 

        presents CIMI's work as an alpha tester of OAI, and looks ahead to future 

        developments.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class=normal>The ubiquity of the Web and success of popular search engines 

        have fueled an expectation for quick, easy, and successful results in 

        the quest for information and knowledge. Increasingly, scholars, students 

        and other explorers are turning to the Web for their research needs and 

        relying less often on traditional research sources. Museums have immensely 

        rich information resources in publications, research papers, exhibition 

        catalogues, virtual museums, databases, and intranets, but access to much 

        information of value about the kinds of materials museums hold is rarely 

        available through web search engines. Internet search engines only reach 

        static HTML web pages, but much of what museums have is opaque to the 

        indexers because it is in databases, dynamically generated, or in some 

        other non-HTML form. These resources constitute what is becoming known 

        as the hidden Web, estimated to contain 400-550 times more content than 

        the commonly defined Web. (BrightPlanet 2001) </p>

      <p class=normal>If this problem alone were solved and all the hidden web 

        resources were suddenly available for indexing, the difficulty of finding 

        reliable, useful, precise information would be seriously compounded, not 

        alleviated. One way to address this is through collecting and indexing 

        metadata records, rather than indexing the entire contents of HTML pages, 

        thereby providing greater possibilities for precision. This is essentially 

        the traditional library approach of creating descriptive metadata and 

        building union catalogues. However, library catalogues are expensive to 

        maintain and in the Web world, both difficult to find and hard to search 

        across. </p>

      <p class=normal>As separate approaches, it seems neither the old library 

        methods nor the new Internet approach is serving researchers and scholars 

        particularly well. (CLIR 2001) </p>

      <p class=normal>A particularly promising solution is to explore the utility 

        of combining the best of traditional library and museum techniques, such 

        as creating descriptive metadata records in catalogues, with the best 

        of new Internet techniques like large scale, machine harvesting of information. It is possible to consider this because of new developments in Web workable 

        technical protocols, the uptake of XML as a way to package and transfer 

        information, and the development of international standards for describing 

        museum metadata content. </p>

      <h1>The Open Archives Initiative</h1>

      <p class=normal>The Open Archives Initiative, OAI, (<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/" target="new">http://www.openarchives.org</a>) 

        develops and promotes technical protocols and standards, collectively 

        called the OAI technical framework, to facilitate access to scholarly 

        research information on the Web. It is based on the premise that a simple, 

        easily implemented technical framework can allow holders of information 

        to create repositories of metadata describing their resources that in 

        turn can be harvested and made available for further processing or use. 

        (OAI Protocol 2001)</p>

      <p class=normal>The OAI technical framework describes how <i>repositories</i> 

        of metadata about information resources are constructed. Repositories 

        are essentially network accessible servers offered by data providers. A repository makes available via a simple protocol <i>records </i>that 

        contain metadata about its items (content). A repository may, optionally, 

        organize its items into sets corresponding to its collections or other 

        groups, thus allowing clients to harvest metadata records selectively.</p>

      <p class=normal>A <i>record</i> is an XML encoded byte-stream that serves 

        as a packaging mechanism for harvested metadata. The OAI protocol mandates 

        the use of unqualified Dublin Core as the common record for discovery. 

        (Dublin Core 2001) It also allows community-specific metadata sets described 

        by XML SCHEMAS for more detailed description based on the assertion that 

        both simple metadata for interoperability and cross-domain discovery as 

        well as a method for conveying richer community-specific descriptions 

        are needed.</p>

      <p class=normal>All OAI repositories must recognize a set of requests or 

        <i>verbs</i> carried in http POST or Get methods that allow access to 

        the metadata records. It is through these commands that metadata is harvested 

        and transferred.</p>

      <p class=normal>One design criteria of the OAI technical framework of particular 

        relevance to individual communities such as the museum community is the 

        notion of <i>extension packages</i>. Not only does the protocol allow 

        a community to expose its own metadata schema, but it also allows other 

        extensions such as unique collection level metadata or, if deemed necessary, 

        rights metadata. The OAI protocol doesn't place limits on the number of 

        allowable metadata sets, but does specify that their data formats be describable 

        by an XML Schema.</p>

      <p class=normal>In order to federate distributed repositories, the OAI has 

        established a registry service available through the OAI web page to provide 

        a list of publicly available repositories and to provide a mechanism for 

        conformance testing. (OAI Registry 2001) </p>

      <p class=normal>The potential of OAI technical framework is in providing 

        the enabling technology for the federating of distributed information 

        resources and their discovery and use. The power of the OAI technical 

        framework is in its simplicity and ease of implementation. </p>

      <h1>Describing Information Resources for Discovery: Dublin Core and XML</h1>

      <p class=normal>While the OAI protocol defines new technical standards for 

        repositories and the machine-to-machine dialogue between data providers 

        and harvesters, it draws on the established international standard Dublin 

        Core for the mandatory metadata record format. (Dublin Core 2001) The 

        Dublin Core metadata set was developed specifically to allow a simple 

        and easy-to-use description of information resources for their discovery. 

        The utility of Dublin Core was corroborated by CIMI in its Dublin Core 

        Metadata Testbed that explored the use of unqualified Dublin Core for 

        discovery of museum resources, both at a coarse grain level and at a more 

        detailed, complex level. At the higher, coarse grain level, the Dublin 

        Core is effective both for discovery of resources and as a means for museums 

        to interoperate with other communities in a networked environment such 

        as the World Wide Web. (CIMI 1999a) </p>

      <p class=normal>To go beyond simple discovery and interoperation, the OAI 

        anticipated, through inclusion of the <i>extension packages</i> concept, 

        that in addition to a core metadata format, individual communities of 

        implementers would require additional descriptive formats. Again, this 

        need was borne out in the CIMI Dublin Core testbed findings where it was 

        concluded that extending the Dublin Core to handle community-specific 

        needs was problematic. (CIMI 1999a)</p>

      <p class=normal>Alternatives need to be found to extending or qualifying 

        Dublin Core to facilitate the more complete descriptions needed by the 

        museum community. The OAI addresses this by allowing support for parallel 

        metadata sets. For museums, this could conceivably include record structures 

        such as SPECTRUM (rich museum object information), CIMI (public access), 

        AMICO (art museum images), MIDIS (monuments and built environment), OBJECT 

        ID (loss and theft), and RLG Inc.'s CMI (Cultural materials). </p>

      <p class=normal>The challenge is that each community of OAI implementers 

        must agree on what metadata formats are needed beyond the core, and must 

        provide XML SCHEMAS for each of them. Once this is accomplished, the metadata 

        foundations will be in place for use of the OAI protocol. </p>

      <p class=normal>Early in the development of the OAI, CIMI recognized it 

        had a number of features that could help significantly advance access 

        to museum information. First and perhaps most importantly, the OAI protocol 

        was simple and appeared to be easy to implement using tools and skills 

        (Webservers, http, JAVA, PERL, CGI etc.) within the easy reach of museums. 

        Secondly, it relied on the Dublin Core as a metadata format for the simple 

        discovery of information resources within and between communities. This 

        format was proven workable for museums, and there exists a guide to best 

        practice for its use. (CIMI 1999b) Finally, the OAI mandated XML for packaging 

        richer metadata sets and transferring records. XML is a standard that 

        is gaining wide acceptance in museums, and XML SCHEMAS exist or are in 

        the process of being created for many of the community standards mentioned 

        above.</p>

      <h1>CIMI's test of OAI V.1.0</h1>

      <p class=normal>Because of the perceived potential of OAI for museums, CIMI 

        participated as a pre-release tester of the OAI protocol. (OAI Alpha Test 

        2001) As part of the test, we built a generic OAI-compliant repository. 

        (CIMI OAI Repository 2001). The repository architecture shown in Figure 

        1 uses a layered approach, standardized APIs, a generic http interface, 

        and interchangeable components. This allows implementers the use of different 

        back-end databases, webservers, or XML generators and minimizes hard-wired 

        coding.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="perkins_figure_1.jpg" width="432" height="324" alt="Figure 1: CIMI OAI Repository Layered Architecture"></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1: CIMI OAI Repository Layered Architecture</p>

      <p class=normal>The repository took a skilled JAVA programmer two weeks 

        elapsed time to build. This period included both an orientation to CIMI 

        and the OAI as well as reading and understanding the protocol, and then 

        building the application. The development process started with designing 

        a JAVA API for the repository and a JAVA servlet to interface between 

        http/OAI protocol layers and the repository. The reference repository 

        was written using MySQL and JDBC. </p>

      <p class=normal>The CIMI reference application serves Dublin Core records 

        from an Apache Webserver generated by the earlier CIMI testbed from the 

        MySQL database. Because of the modularity inherent in the architecture, 

        the Repository could be layered on top of any ODBC-compliant database, 

        be served from other servers, and make use of different XML generators.</p>

      <h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

      <p class=normal>The initial evaluation demonstrated that the OAI protocol 

        is indeed simple to build. CIMI has limited technical resources and skills 

        but was nonetheless able to successfully build an OAI repository that 

        appears to be useful. Based on the positive experience as an alpha implementer, 

        CIMI plans to continue explorations of the OAI protocol and research its 

        use by museums. </p>

      <p class=normal>One way is by making the code for the CIMI repository and 

        its associated explanatory materials available for downloading from the 

        CIMI Website. (CIMI Publications 2001) We hope museums will take advantage 

        of its availability to install, experiment with and use the protocol. 

        We hope to compile and report the experiences of these <i>ad hoc</i> tests.</p>

      <p class=normal>CIMI is also interested in conducting a more formal, large-scale 

        test of the OAI for museums as a CIMI testbed. As part of this work, we 

        propose using OAI V.1.x in combination with scoped extensions and other 

        applications necessary for aggregation processes (e.g. editorial control, 

        content management and enhancement, registry) to harvest and collect museum 

        metadata from cultural memory organizations. It will focus on materials 

        that document culture and civilizations, including museum objects, art, 

        images, and related materials. We will structure this as a CIMI testbed, 

        inviting participation from a group of interested members. We expect respondents 

        to include national museum organizations, individual museums, commercial 

        enterprises, and museum system vendors. Once underway, the project will 

        run 12-18 months in concert with projects in other communities and the 

        OAI test period.</p>

      <p class=normal>The purpose of the research is to explore how a specific 

        community of users can use the OAI protocol. Part of this is to investigate 

        what agreements users need to make within the protocol framework itself 

        (e.g. additional metadata sets), and part is to identify any extensions 

        or modification required to make the framework additionally useful. Our 

        testbed will give museums a place to expose their metadata and promote 

        their institutions, test the OAI protocol for utility in describing non-bibliographic 

        resources, and could provide a rich resource of cultural metadata leading 

        eventually to the materials themselves and the institutions offering them.</p>

      <p class=normal>It is one thing to test the technical viability of the OAI 

        protocol by implementing the protocol at a technical level, but another 

        to imagine and determine useful services that might be built on it. We 

        have imagined a number of scenarios that could be tested.</p>

      <p class=normal>We imagine, for example, that services like AMOL (Australian 

        Museums Online), AMICO, the Canadian Digital Museum, or RLG Inc.'s Cultural 

        Materials Initiative might want to add a feature to &quot;search for more 

        like this&quot; in collections or repositories not under their direct 

        control. We imagine that individual museums or groups of museums all using 

        the same collections management system might make use of the repository 

        for internal operational needs, for scholarly access, as well as for supplementing 

        information services they provide publicly. We imagine that commercial 

        services such as AskArt (<a href="http://www.askart.com/" target="new">http://www.askart.com</a>) 

        - a directory of American Artists - or Virtualology (<a href="http://www.virtualology.com/" target="new">http://www.virtualology.com</a>) 

        - a virtual education project - would find the resource attractive and 

        useful. We imagine that an easy-to-use protocol might be attractive to 

        sales and auction houses, encouraging them to make useful research information 

        resources available (such as those now manually compiled). We expect national 

        service providers like the UK JISC higher education information services 

        to have an interest in using museum repositories. We know that the operators 

        of the new Internet top-level-domain for museums (MusDoma) are extremely 

        interested in providing directory-like services that would include search 

        access to our harvested cultural materials metadata. We also imagine that 

        harvesting exhibition catalogues and museum publications from library 

        catalogues, artist biographies, museological literature from A&amp;I services, 

        and sales records from auction houses is of interest to museum researchers. 

        These all are the kinds of services that might emerge once the OAI is 

        widely deployed in the museum community.</p>

      <p class=normal>Regardless of the services developed, there will be a number 

        of issues relating to widespread adoption of the OAI protocol in the museum 

        co<span class="Normal">mmunity. We foresee a need for our community to 

        test hypotheses, assertions, and issues such as:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">the utility of the Dublin Core for meeting information 

          requirements of service providers and consumers;</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">the functionality of the OAI protocol as a basis 

          for a harvesting service, including issues of hierarchical descriptions, 

          scalability, required extensions, presentation and partitioning;</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">community extensions required for the OAI and 

          DC in order to provide useful metadata within and between communities;</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">requirements and practices for content management, 

          metadata enhancement, and editorial control</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">aggregation, integration, access and presentation 

          of bibliographic, textual, multiple media, and object metadata</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">the need, scope and services of a registry</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">access control and rights</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">mechanisms, processes for paths to underlying 

          content</span></span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">business model for sustainability</span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class=normal>Both CIMI and many of our members have significant experience 

        in the metadata harvesting business. It is this experience that motivates 

        us to explore the OAI protocol as an enabling technology to facilitate 

        access to resources by making it easier for museums to expose and collect 

        metadata. The OAI protocol in concert with a museum testbed seems a logical 

        and sensible research initiative that will bring us closer to making the 

        rich information resources museums hold more widely available to researchers 

        and other users.</p>
