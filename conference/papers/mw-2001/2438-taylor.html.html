      <p class=PaperTitle>The Effect of Surrogation on Viewer Response to Expressional 

        Qualities in Works of Art: Preliminary Findings from the Toledo Picture 

        Study</p>

      <p class=Author>Bradley L. Taylor, University of Michigan, USA</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>An empirical study conducted at the Toledo (Ohio) 

        Museum of Art examined the responses of 86 non-expert museum visitors 

        to pictures presented in five formats--oil on canvas paintings, printed 

        pages from books, black-and-white glossy photos, color slides, and digital 

        images. Test subjects responded to the same 20 pictures presented in different 

        formats and different showing orders, identifying the expressional content 

        depicted in the images and answering questions designed to test perceptions 

        of the ability of surrogates to reproduce the expressional power of an 

        original oil painting. This paper reports preliminary findings from the 

        Toledo Picture Study.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The study offers findings of significant interest 

        to those seeking to expand access to museum and visual resource collections 

        to non-specialist users. The process of testing on multiple surrogate 

        types is expected to suggest which formats best convey the expressional 

        essence of a work to those individuals searching without the benefit of 

        expert language or a knowledge of artists, art historical periods, or 

        artistic styles. The ability to extend access to the vast audience that 

        exists beyond art history scholars and museum professionals not only serves 

        to advance greater educational, cultural, and societal goals, but serves 

        to restore this body of documentation to the greater public from which 

        it originated.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Keywords: Surrogation, Surrogate, Perception, Original,

      <h1>Problem Statement</h1>

      <p class=normal>While important research in the past has facilitated the 

        ability to create, retrieve, and store digital images, the absence of 

        a recognized standard for cataloging and classifying museum collections 

        has kept access to museum collections information far beyond the reach 

        of most interested users. Research centering on those people seeking access 

        to image-based materials<span> 3/4 </span>specifically, studies of their 

        queries, their perception of images, and the interrelationships they see 

        within collections of images<span> 3/4 </span>has lagged far behind the 

        work that has centered on building systems to deliver visual materials 

        (Romer, 1996). The dearth of research on users is exacerbated by the fact 

        that the vast majority of user studies that have been conducted have focused 

        on the behaviors, needs, and perceptions of subject specialists (i.e., 

        Corkill and Mann, 1978; Stone, 1982; Stam, 1984 a, b; Watson-Boone, 1994; 

        Cobbledick, 1996; and, Rasmussen, 1998). A lack of attention to the great 

        numbers of non-expert users has left those without specialized knowledge 

        of art history and museums even further disenfranchised. This study seeks 

        to take an important step forward by clarifying our understanding of (1) 

        how non-specialists perceive the expressional content of images, and (2) 

        how non-specialists respond to different types of surrogates. </p>

      <p class=normal>One of the primary concerns voiced by writers is how users 

        perceive the surrogate forms that are most often used to represent original 

        works of art. While progress continues to be made on replicating the physical 

        features of works of art, many argue that a work of art's expressional 

        qualities<span> 3/4 </span>those emotional, affective, or spiritual aspects 

        of a piece that define its essence<span> 3/4 </span>become irretrievably 

        lost in the process of surrogation. As the world's museums move toward 

        the large-scale digitization of their collections, the time has clearly 

        come to empirically examine prevailing assumptions about surrogation and 

        to see whether expressional qualities do, in fact, survive in reproductive 

        formats. To that end, the purpose of this study shall be to investigate 

        the effect of surrogation on viewer response to expressional qualities 

        in works of art.</p>

      <h1>Theoretical Foundations and Research Hypotheses</h1>

      <p class=normal>This new study will use as its theoretical basis Panofsky's 

        (1955) proposed "three levels of meaning" in art and his assertion that 

        the most basic of these levels, the pre-iconographic level, presumes ready 

        comprehension by non-expert test subjects of "primary or natural subject 

        matter," defined as being &quot;of an elementary and easily understandable 

        nature&quot; (Panofsky, 1955, p. 26). Panofsky divides primary or natural 

        subject matter further into the factual and the expressional. Should the 

        expressional content of art truly exist at an "elementary and easily understandable" 

        level, non-expert viewers should be able to identify its presence in both 

        original works of art and representations of those same works of art.</p>

      <p class=normal>At the same time, this study also acknowledges the impact 

        of the writings of art historian Walter Benjamin and others who warn of 

        the differences that exist between original works of art and reproductions 

        of the same. In spite of what would appear to be conflicting theoretical 

        bases, we offer the following research hypotheses:</p>

      <p class=normal>H1. We believe that test subjects will be able to identify 

        emotions and feelings across all formats when tested in part I of the 

        study.</p>

      <p class=normal>H2. We believe that the emotions and feelings identified 

        by test subjects will correlate at statistically significant levels.</p>

      <p class=normal>H3. We believe, nonetheless, that the results of survey 

        questions will reveal differences between the experience of looking at 

        original works of art and looking at surrogates in various reproductive 

        formats. </p>

      <p class=normal>H4. We believe that some differences in response will be 

        linked both to familiarity with computers and frequent viewing of original 

        art.</p>

      <p class=normal>H5. We believe that the differences subjects identify between 

        original works of art and surrogates will point to new topics that will 

        provide the basis for further study, i.e. the historical nature of original 

        documentation, issues of personal response, and the effect of the museum 

        setting on the way subjects experience original works of art. </p>

      <h1>The Toledo Picture Study</h1>

      <p class=normal>To test these research hypotheses, an experiment was conducted 

        to test non-expert subjects on their perceptions of the similarities and 

        differences that exist between original works of art and four different 

        surrogate formats: printed book pages, digital images, black-and-white 

        glossy photographs, and color slides. The experiment was conducted during 

        the summer of 2000 at the Toledo (Ohio) Museum of Art. This site was selected 

        as the museum showed signs of being receptive to hosting the study, had 

        collections sufficiently large to facilitate the careful selection of 

        paintings for inclusion in the study, and offered a highly motivated roster 

        of volunteer support that proved crucial in the subject recruitment phase 

        of the study. The Toledo community, likewise, was thought to be able to 

        provide a more representative sample of non-expert users for the study 

        than the smaller, university-focused community in which the researcher 

        is based. The Toledo Picture Study was conducted to address the following 

        research question and its attendant components:</p>

      <h1>Research Question: </h1>

      <p class=normal>What is the effect of surrogation on viewer response to 

        expressi<span class="normal">onal qualities in works of art?</span></p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Do viewers respond to the expressional content of 

          original works of art and their surrogates in the same way?</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Do viewers identify the same expressional qualities 

          in both original works of art and their surrogates?</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> What is the nature and magnitude of differences perceived 

          between original works of art and their surrogates?</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Do demographic factors such as gender, computer use, 

          or museum attendance affect the way viewers respond to the pictures 

          examined in this research?</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> What are the broader implications of these findings?</span></li>

      </ol>

      <p class=normal><span class="normal">Participants in the Toledo Picture 

        Study were asked to identify the emotions and feelings they saw in twenty 

        pictures, each drawn from the Toledo Museum of Art's collection of 

        nineteenth- and twentiet</span>h-century European and American oil paintings. 

        This focus was selected in order to control for possible differences in 

        the type of art being shown to test subjects and to provide test subjects 

        with a body of work that was likely to seem familiar to them in terms 

        of period and style. In order to control for the influence of the type 

        of art being shown, subjects saw pictures distributed across five different 

        artistic types--action or activity pictures, where the focus of the 

        work is centered largely on physical movement; genre scenes, where the 

        focus of the work is on domestic activities or interior scenes; landscapes; 

        modern art, defined, generally, here as artistic style that begins to 

        push the boundaries of representationalism; and, portraits. Choices for 

        these artistic types or "genres" were based largely on the findings of 

        Kettlewell (1988), Kettlewell, Lipscomb, Evans, and Rosston (1990), and 

        Winston and Cupchik (1992), who suggested that non-expert viewers respond 

        differently to different types of artistic genres.</p>

      <p class=normal>In order to test for the effect of surrogation, test subjects 

        were shown the pictures distributed across an equal number of the formats 

        being studied--oil on canvas paintings, digital images, black-and-white 

        glossy photographs, color slides projected on a screen, and printed book 

        pages. The four surrogate formats were selected not because they best 

        capture the essence of original art but because they have been among the 

        most common ways that original art has been reproduced for general use--in 

        printed books and catalogs, on computer screens, as the format of choice 

        for documentary purposes in museums, and in countless classroom settings. 

        While general specifications for these surrogate types will be provided 

        in a section to follow, it should be stated that the primary purpose of 

        this research was to examine whether differences in emotional response 

        exist between original works of art and surrogate representations of those 

        same works, not to investigate the subtleties in physical likeness that 

        may have been elicited from gradient differences between types of surrogates 

        (i.e., Panofsky's expressional meaning as opposed to Panofsky's 

        factual meaning). Once the existence of these essential differences have 

        been established empirically, details of the differences that exist within 

        categories of surrogates might, in fact, be of considerable interest.</p>

      <h1>Experimental Design</h1>

      <p class=normal>A repeated Graeco-Latin squares research design was used 

        to assure both the randomization of which pictures test subjects saw in 

        which reproductive format but also which picture the test subjects saw 

        in which order. The basic 5 <span>´</span> 5 grid design that forms the 

        basis of the Latin square allowed the researcher to map out a sequence 

        of "viewings" of five pictures for test subjects that controlled for the 

        overall effect of varying genres and formats. To help control for the 

        possible effect of showing order, another 5 <span>´</span> 5 grid was 

        superimposed on the Latin square, creating a Graeco-Latin square; and 

        because each test subject needed to be shepherded through a total of twenty 

        pictures, the pattern was repeated four times, making the basic design 

        for the experiment a repeated Graeco-Latin square design. With the three 

        intervening variables--genre, format, and showing order--thus 

        built into, and counterbalanced by, the research design, the researcher 

        was able to focus directly on the responses given by test subjects without 

        having to be concerned about the fact that, for example, portraits preceded 

        landscapes, digital images followed original works of art, or the fact 

        that, for example, the Sargent immediately preceded the Monet. </p>

      <h1>Findings from the Pretest</h1>

      <p class=normal>Statistical findings from a pretest conducted in March 2000 

        at the University of Michigan Museum of Art provide consistent and persuasive 

        support for the research hypotheses advanced earlier. Even with a pretest 

        population of only twelve individuals, the differences in means on all 

        of the questions in part II of the pretest clearly point to differences 

        that became only more apparent with the larger sample size in Toledo. 

        Moreover, qualitative results from the open-ended questions supported 

        these findings and added considerable depth to the numerical results the 

        statistical analysis revealed. What we anticipate in the Toledo Picture 

        Study, then, is confirmation of these initial results, further explication 

        of these findings through more open-ended questioning, and a deeper understanding 

        of the statistical findings by using tests of association to compare our 

        major variables with demographic data gathered on gender, computer use, 

        and museum attendance.<u></u></p>

      <h1>Reliability and Validity</h1>

      <p class=normal>The choice of a repeated Graeco-Latin square research design 

        offset the possibility of noise coming from such intervening factors as 

        genre and subject. The use of a controlled vocabulary as the basis for 

        the attributions made in part I of the study greatly controlled for problems 

        with synonymy that might arise: while it was not possible to control differences 

        in the way subjects perceived different emotions, the language they used 

        in identifying those emotions was, at least, controlled. The pretest helped 

        in identifying several unclear questions and the need to add more questions 

        in order to test further those differences pretest subjects identified. 

        In addition, the pretest process allowed the researcher to address issues 

        in the administration of the pretest that was used to further strengthen 

        the administration of the Toledo Picture Study. </p>

      <h1>Recruitment and Participation of Test Subjects</h1>

      <p class=normal>Arriving at a successful subject recruitment strategy proved 

        an unanticipated obstacle in executing the study. Museum visitors approached 

        on the gallery floor almost always declined an invitation to participate 

        in the study. An informal survey of museum visitors taken several weeks 

        into the study revealed that most visitors were hesitant to commit to 

        more than an a half hour of time to the study. Reasons given most often 

        were not enough time to give, not wanting to abandon other members of 

        their party in order to participate in the study, and the fact that they 

        were visiting the museum on their way to another destination: lack of 

        financial incentive did not appear to be a factor. Since the Toledo Picture 

        Study took most participants an hour and a half to complete, a different 

        recruitment strategy was deemed essential.</p>

      <p class=normal>In the end, invitations to participate were extended by 

        e-mail and telephone to a number of people who were thought to be highly 

        motivated to participate. Successful referrals came from museum staff, 

        residents of the Toledo community, personal acquaintances, and from the 

        test subjects themselves. The final subject pool comprised a high number 

        of museum aides (volunteer fund raisers for the museum) and their acquaintances, 

        professional members of the Toledo business community, personal acquaintances, 

        and the visiting public. Their common bond was a lack of formal subject 

        expertise and a willingness to support the museum through their participation 

        in the study. Advance familiarity with the collections was measured and 

        was found to be balanced across the subject pool; that said, only two 

        of the test participants had received any docent training. and were familiar 

        enough with the collections to speak knowledgeably about specific items 

        in the collection. In all, 86 individuals participated in the Toledo 

        Picture Study.</p>

      <p class=normal>Test subjects were asked specifically to identify "feelings 

        and emotions" they saw depicted in the pictures they were shown. The task 

        in part I of the study was one of identification (i.e., "what feelings 

        and emotions do you see depicted?") as opposed to one of interpretation 

        (i.e., "what feelings or emotions does this create in you?"). Such distinctions 

        need not cause confusion for test participants. Using the example of a 

        Giotto painting, Tilghman suggests that human ability to read grief in 

        a painting does not necessarily evoke grieving in the viewer (objectified 

        feeling). Similarly, those works that may evoke the strongest feeling 

        (i.e., the print that was hanging on the kitchen wall the night old Rover 

        died) may have nothing in their subject matter that relates directly to 

        the response evoked (embodied feeling) (Tilghman, 1970, pp. 2, 3). Possible 

        confusion over such distinctions was addressed as part of the participant 

        instruction process. In part II of the study, subjects responded to a 

        series of questions asking about the process of looking at pictures in 

        different formats and provided demographic information about gender, computer 

        use and museum attendance.</p>

      <p class=normal>Test subjects selected their responses for part I of the 

        study from a controlled list of terms first published by Shaver et al. 

        (1987) in the <u>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</u>. This 

        list was deemed suitable for purposes of this experiment since it was 

        developed by scholars within the field of social psychology, was the result 

        of years of study on the terminology of emotions, and yielded an "interrelated 

        set of emotion categories...organized within an abstract to concrete 

        hierarchy" (Shaver et al., 1987, p. 1061). The Shaver et al. vocabulary, 

        while not claiming to be exhaustive, nonetheless offered test subjects 

        a wide variety of terms (136 terms, divided into 25 clusters), and could 

        be used to code the resulting data for statistical analysis. In addition, 

        one of the significant findings from the pretest was both the need for 

        viewers to use a controlled vocabulary for this part of the test and posttest 

        findings revealing that the Shaver et al. (1987) vocabulary offered the 

        broad range of attributes pretest takers were seeking.</p>

      <p class=normal>Since the nature and ordering of the material provided in 

        part I of the study varied from test subject to test subject, the researcher 

        accompanied test subjects throughout the first half of the study. The 

        researcher identified the next picture to be viewed and provided the picture 

        to the test subject in the appropriate format for viewing. By the time 

        part I of the study was completed, test subjects had been shown four original 

        works of art, four printed pages from books, four digital images, four 

        black-and-white glossy photographs, and four color slides projected on 

        a screen. Test subjects completed part II of the study largely on their 

        own<span> 3/4 </span>they were provided with a quiet space in which to 

        work and enough time to complete the testing at their own pace. The Toledo 

        Picture Study took most test subjects between one and one and one-half 

        hours to complete.</p>

      <h1>Preparing the Experiment</h1>

      <p class=normal>In addition to the preparation of the testing instrument, 

        much advance effort was expended on the logistics of preparing for the 

        study at the Toledo (Ohio) Museum of Art. With the cooperation of the 

        museum registrar, twenty nineteenth- and twentieth-century Western European 

        and American oil paintings were selected from the museum's permanent 

        collection to provide the subject matter for the testing. Since the test 

        involved showing subjects this artwork in a variety of formats (oil on 

        canvas, printed pages from a book, digital images, black-and-white glossy 

        photographs, and color slides), the registrar and the museum's visual 

        resources staff helped facilitate access to the twenty oil paintings selected 

        for the test in all five formats intended for inclusion. The oil paintings 

        were all on exhibit in the museum's galleries for the duration of 

        the study<span> 3/4 </span>pieces scheduled to travel or pieces in galleries 

        scheduled for reinstallation, thus, were not selected for inclusion in 

        the study. The three largest pieces selected for inclusion were works 

        by Chuck Close (100'' x 84"), John Singer Sargent (65" x 38"), 

        and Paul-Gustave Dore (42" x 72"); the three smallest pieces included 

        were by Eugene Delacroix (23" x 28"), John Lewis Krimmel (16 x 22"), and 

        Henry Walton (25"x 30").</p>

      <p class=normal>The printed book page surrogates were taken from published 

        catalogs of the museum's European and American collections or from 

        one of several annual reports that were provided by the Toledo registrar. Sizes for the book pictures ranged from 4" x 3" to 6" x 8". Since test 

        subjects saw only four examples in any given format, it is unlikely that 

        any individual subject saw the extremes in size that are provided here: 

        the measurements are intended to provide only a general overview of what 

        individual test subjects might have seen. Black-and-white glossy photographs 

        were taken from the registrar's files<span> 3/4 </span>all photographs 

        measured 8 <span>´</span> 10 inches. Two-inch square glass slide surrogates 

        of the oil paintings were provided by the museum's visual resources 

        staff and were shown using a Kodak Ektagraphic III AMT slide projector. 

        The top of the Bretford brand projection screen was raised 96 inches from 

        the floor, with the screen bottom 6 inches off the floor. Both the viewer 

        and the projector were set about 11 1/2 feet from the screen in a interior 

        windowless room lighted only by a small tensor lamp which provided enough 

        light for test subjects to read their controlled vocabularies and mark 

        their test sheets. Image sizes for the projected slides ranged from 4' 

        x 3' to 3' x 4'.</p>

      <p class=normal>Digital image surrogates were prepared from the same color 

        slides as served as the slide surrogates in the study. The initial scans 

        were made using an Epson Expression 836 XL scanner set at 300 d.p.i. These 

        new scans were cropped and color balanced using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software 

        viewed on a View Sonic 20 inch color monitor. The resulting TIFF files 

        were then moved onto the museum's central server and were ready for 

        viewing. Test subjects viewed the digital images on a Power Mac 7100/66 

        AV Power PC, made available by the museum for the duration of the study. 

        The computer's 13-inch monitor was capable of showing only 72 d.p.i., 

        so the initial scans ended up being made at a higher degree of resolution 

        than could be shown to the test participants. Similarly, the computer's 

        modest RAM capabilities resulted in loading times of up to 15 seconds 

        for images to appear on the computer screen. An earlier set of digital 

        scans made from color transparencies was not used because their larger 

        file sizes took even longer to load. Perceived limitations of the hardware 

        notwithstanding, responses to questions about digital images in the Toledo 

        Picture Study closely approximate those in the pretest, which had used 

        more sophisticated hardware and software. In addition, the viewing conditions 

        used for the digital images in the Toledo Picture Study met the same technical 

        specifications as the public access terminals available in the museum's 

        Community Learning Resource Center, the primary center for viewing digital 

        images within the museum.</p>

      <p class=normal>During the testing period, the catalogues and annual reports, 

        which provided the source material for the printed book pages, remained 

        closed when not being used. When the time came for pretest subjects to 

        look at pictures in the books, they were handed a book which had been 

        opened to the individual page they were to view. The black-and-white glossy 

        photos had been ordered in advance and placed in a manila file folder. 

        Subjects saw only those photographs that were part of their test, the 

        photographs being brought out individually for their viewing. For both 

        the book and the glossy photo examples, caption information was either 

        masked off or was simply not available. When viewing the color slides, 

        subjects waited for the lights to be turned off and were shown only those 

        pictures that were part of their test. For the digital image examples, 

        the screen of the Power Mac remained set to a default screen and individual 

        items were called up one at a time by the researcher; no caption information 

        was available. </p>

      <h1>Administering the Experiment</h1>

      <p class=normal>Upon arrival at the museum, test subjects were greeted, 

        escorted to the registrar's office, assisted in the storage of coats, 

        purses, etc., and introduced to any museum staff who might be in the immediate 

        vicinity of the testing area, in order to make them feel welcome. The 

        starting point for each test session was a three-sided cubicle used as 

        the digital image viewing area since it allowed for the most privacy. 

        After some initial pleasantries, pretest subjects were handed several 

        stapled sheets of paper that comprised the Participant Instructions and 

        both parts I and II of the study and were asked to read through the Participant 

        Instructions. Upon completion, they signed an informed-consent statement 

        giving their assent to participate in the study and were reminded that 

        their participation in the pretest was completely voluntary. Test subjects 

        were then asked if they had any questions before the testing began and 

        were reminded verbally that what was being sought in part I of the study 

        was their perception of the feelings and emotions displayed in the pictures 

        they were about to see. They selected from among a half-dozen sharpened 

        No. 2 pencils provided for their use in the study and were asked to turn 

        the page and begin part I of the study.</p>

      <p class=normal>While each test subject saw each of the twenty pictures 

        during the test, they were each shown the pictures only once, in different 

        formats and in a different showing order. Test subjects completed part 

        I of the study with no restrictions on their time nor on the number of 

        responses they were allowed to give. When test subjects showed obvious 

        signs that they were through with a particular picture (using verbal cues 

        such as "OK," "all right," etc., or cues through gesture such as looking 

        up and making eye contact, etc.), they were either shown the next in the 

        format they were viewing or were moved to the next set of pictures. Once 

        test subjects had completed their work on part I of the study, they were 

        brought back to the registrar's office and left on their own to complete 

        part II. Most subjects took approximately 75-90 minutes to complete the 

        entire test. At the end of each test session, an informal conversation 

        took place about the test, the testing instrument, and any questions test 

        subjects wished to ask about the nature of the research being conducted. 

        Most subjects found the test process stimulating and stayed an additional 

        five to ten minutes to share their reflections on the process. At the 

        end of the entire test session, subjects were thanked, given their choice 

        of a souvenir notecard (one of the pictures from the study), and escorted 

        back to the entrance of the museum. A final formal thank-you brought the 

        test session to an end.</p>

      <p class=normal>The testing was conducted in several different locations 

        within the museum, each selected as being the best location available 

        for viewing the various surrogate formats. Headquarters for the testing 

        was the registrar's office. Inside, two large wooden desks were used 

        for viewing the book page and glossy photo surrogates. The desks provided 

        a generous surface area that allowed not only room for the surrogates 

        themselves but also for the testing instrument, the controlled vocabulary, 

        the personal belongings of the test subject, and for the researcher and 

        test subject to sit at right angles to one another. Lighting in this area 

        came from a series of filtered overhead fluorescent lights and only minimal 

        noise came from the surrounding office activities. None of the test subjects 

        ever mentioned office noise as a distraction. The digital images were 

        viewed within a three-sided cubicle located within another section of 

        the registrar's office. The lighting and relative noise conditions 

        were the same as for viewing the book and glossy photo surrogates. Since 

        much of the surface space of the table in this cubicle was taken up by 

        the computer and the researcher's testing materials, test subjects 

        usually viewed the digital images while holding a clipboard with the testing 

        instrument and controlled vocabulary in their laps. Viewing of the color 

        slides took place in a little-used classroom down the hall from the registrar's 

        office. This allowed the projector and screen to remain up and ready for 

        use throughout the three months of testing without interfering with any 

        daily office activities. Positioning of the projector, the viewer, and 

        the screen has been discussed previously. Finally, for the original works 

        of art, test subjects were led to individual paintings by the researcher 

        and were asked, as much as was possible, to ignore any caption information, 

        concentrating exclusively on the picture itself. Most subjects seemed 

        happy to comply.</p>

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>

      <p class=normal>Quantitative results will be analyzed differently for data 

        gathered in part I and part II of the Toledo Picture Study. In both cases, 

        however, quantitative results will be subjected to univariate, bivariate, 

        and multivariate statistical analyses using SPSS 9.0 software. Descriptive 

        statistics will be provided for all quantitative response categories and 

        the appropriate statistical tests, including correlations, analyses of 

        variance (ANOVAs) and multiple analyses of variance (MANOVAs), will be 

        conducted and the results reported, with levels of significance provided. 

        Analyses of variance were selected as the statistical operation of choice 

        in many cases since it allows for the direct comparison and analysis of 

        means across response categories within a given question. The use of nominal 

        level data in the Toledo Picture Study proscribes deeper analysis of the 

        data; while it will be possible to detect differences that exist in the 

        mean responses to specific questions, it will not be possible<span> 3/4 

        </span>nor is it the point of this research<span> 3/4 </span>to explore 

        the exact nature of these differences.</p>

      <p class=normal>Responses provided in part I of the study will entail varying 

        numbers of emotional attributes test subjects will ascribe to the twenty 

        pictures they are shown. Test subjects will ascribe a "top term" designation 

        to one of the terms chosen for each picture and those terms will be coded 

        according to their location in the emotional clusters proposed by Shaver 

        et al. (1987). These numerical results will be examined through correlations 

        to see the extent to which "top terms" in the original oil on canvas format 

        correlate with "top terms" given for the same picture in the other four 

        reproductive formats. In addition, comparisons will be made as to the 

        number of terms generated per subject, the number of terms generated per 

        genre, and the number of terms generated per format. This will be achieved 

        by calculating initial means by subject, by genre, and by format, and 

        by comparing those means using a repeated measure Generalized Linear Model 

        (GLM), a form of analysis of variance. Since demographic information on 

        gender, computer use, and museum attendance is being gathered in part 

        II of the study, tests of association will be made between these demographics 

        and the number of terms generated by individuals in part I of the study 

        to see whether any additional insights may be gained. </p>

      <p class=normal>In addition to the demographic information mentioned, the 

        data from part II of the study also includes responses to a number of 

        survey questions designed to test viewers' perceptions of the process 

        of looking at the artwork in part I of the Toledo Picture Study. Among 

        the information included here are answers to questions about the viewer's 

        confidence in the attributions provided in part I, how easy/difficult 

        the process of making attributions was, and, how familiar the viewer was 

        with the pictures seen in advance of the test. Test subjects are then 

        asked about the relative ease/difficulty of identifying feelings and emotions 

        in each of the formats viewed, the intensity of those feelings, and how 

        successful the various surrogate formats were in their ability to re-create 

        the feeling of looking at an oil on canvas painting. Finally, viewers 

        are asked to rank order all five formats in terms of their ability to 

        convey feeling or emotion. Because many of these questions asked for viewers 

        to respond to the same question across multiple formats, multiple analyses 

        of variance (MANOVAs) were deemed to be the statistical operation most 

        appropriate for analyzing much of this data. </p>

      <p class=normal>The data collected from the Toledo Picture Study yielded 

        both qualitative and quantitative findings. Qualitative responses to the 

        open-ended questions asked in part II of the study were collated and examined 

        in aggregate and will be used to offer insight into results from the quantitative 

        analysis. Qualitative responses are also likely to generate ideas for 

        new questions that might be incorporated into subsequent research. As 

        this is a study in progress, complete results from the data analysis are 

        not yet available. The results to be reported in the next section arise 

        from the univariate analysis of all data and from the multivariate analyses 

        completed on part II of the study.</p>

      <h1>Preliminary Findings from the Toledo Picture Study </h1>

      <p class=normal>Eighty-six subjects participated in the two-part Toledo 

        Picture Study during the summer and early fall of 2000. With a foundation 

        based on 20 Western European and American oil paintings drawn from the 

        collections of the Toledo Museum of Art, the study asked subjects both 

        to identify feelings and emotions found in the pictures (each shown to 

        test subjects in one of five different formats) and to offer responses 

        to questions asked about the process of looking at the pictures. In part 

        I of the study<span> 3/4 </span>the naming of emotions and feelings identified 

        in the twenty paintings<span> 3/4 </span>the number of terms generated 

        was calculated by subject, by genre, and by format viewed. The mean value 

        for the number of terms assigned by all test subjects per picture was 

        4.9, with a standard deviation of 1.7.<b></b></p>

      <p class=normal>The mean values for the number of terms assigned within 

        a given genre are shown in table 1.<b> </b>Recast, test subjects provided 

        mean numbers of emotional attributes, by genre, as follows: activity (6.7), 

        genre scene (5.5), modern (4.6), landscape (4.2), and portrait (4.0). 

        These statistics are significant at the .00 level. While no hypotheses 

        were offered based on response by genre, the findings of Kettlewell (1988), 

        Kettlewell, Lipscomb, Evans, and Rosston (1990), and Winston and Cupchik 

        (1992), suggest that non-expert viewers would indeed respond differently 

        to variations in genre viewed. The overall research design anticipated 

        this result and controlled for any influence by genre by balancing the 

        types of works test subjects viewed.<b></b></p>

      <p class=normal>Mean values for the number of terms assigned within a given 

        format are shown in table 2.<b> </b>Recast, test subjects provided mean 

        numbers of emotional attributes, by format, as follows: original (5.1), 

        color slide (5.0), book page (4.9), digital image (4.8), and black-and-white 

        photograph (4.7). These statistics are significant at the .39 level, which 

        indicates no meaningful differences between these means. Given the clear 

        preference for works in oil on canvas that emerged in part II of the study, 

        it is interesting to note that this preference did not manifest itself 

        in part I of the study with a higher number of emotion terms being assigned 

        for oil-on-canvas paintings than for any of the reproductive formats. In any event, the overall research design anticipated this possible effect

      <p class=normal>Because further data analysis has yet to be completed for 

        part I of the study, our discussion will now turn to the results from 

        part II of the study, the survey component of the study. In response to 

        the question "How confident are you in the identification of feelings 

        and emotions you did in part I of this study?," test subjects provided 

        answers on a five-point Likert scale (with 1 indicating "not very confident" 

        and 5 indicating "very confident"). The mean response was 3.9, with a 

        standard deviation of .74, suggesting that test subjects held a healthy 

        confidence in their emotional attributions<span> 3/4 </span>even the lower 

        end of the range rests near the scale's midpoint. </p>

      <p class=normal>The responses to this question almost mirror responses obtained 

        for question 2 in part II of the test, "How easy or difficult was it for 

        you to identify the feelings and emotions expressed in the pictures you 

        looked at in part I of this study?" Test subjects provided answers on 

        a five-point Likert scale (with 1 indicating "very difficult" and 5 indicating 

        "very easy"). The mean response was 3.5, with a standard deviation of 

        .84, indicating that while most of the test subjects had confidence in 

        their responses, they didn't necessarily find the attribution process 

        an easy one. Concerns about the attribution process<span> 3/4 </span>borne 

        out by qualitative data gathered<span> 3/4 </span>center on perceived 

        limitations of the controlled vocabulary used to make the attributions, 

        the difficulty in selecting a single "top term" out of multiple attributions, 

        the confounding influence of multiple points of view that test subjects 

        perceived in several of the pictures, and worries about one's ability 

        to distinguish the artist's intent:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I did not find appropriate words on the list to describe 

        the vastness and complicated feelings of the respect for the powerful 

        scenes of nature. There were an overabundance of negative words that did 

        not allow for the wonder and delight for humans amid the wide expanse, 

        grandeur, and dominance of natural forces.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Sometimes the words that could describe my immediate 

        reaction were not on the list<span> 3/4 </span>so I would find myself 

        returning to the picture to see if I could get a different read on it<span> 

        3/4 </span>usually my first reaction took charge.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>The difficulty was choosing <u>one</u> emotion when 

        I felt the artist was expressing several emotions simultaneously.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>There were two pictures that had multiple or competing 

        emotions displayed so I had difficulty choosing an emotion for those.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>[The problem I had was with] [i]mages that demanded 

        a point of view when it was clear to me that there were (at least) two 

        widely divergent emotions going on in the image (Napoleon, the tavern 

        scene, the desert raid).</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>It was a bit difficult to separate my emotional reactions 

        [from] the emotion shown on the faces of the subjects.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>It is difficult to separate my response from what the 

        artist might be trying to convey.<b></b></p>

      <p class=normal>Question 3 in part II of the study asked test subjects "How 

        familiar were you in advance with the pictures you looked at today?" Test 

        subjects provided answers on a five-point Likert scale (with 1 indicating 

        "not very familiar" and 5 indicating "very familiar"). The mean response 

        was 2.6, with a standard deviation of 1.3, indicating that test subjects 

        were almost evenly divided across the scale. This finding thus suggests 

        that the study's findings are not likely to be skewed by either the 

        subject pool's advance familiarity, or lack thereof, with the works 

        of art included in the study. The various responses to each of these first 

        three survey questions (i.e., confidence, ease/difficulty in identifying 

        emotion, and advance familiarity with the collections) were investigated 

        further through multivariate analysis to examine any possible relationship 

        that may have existed with the responses test subjects gave to the remaining 

        survey questions. No statistically significant findings emerged.</p>

      <p class=normal>Question 4 in part II of the study offered test subjects 

        an opportunity to evaluate the ease or difficulty of identifying feelings 

        and emotions as expressed in the five different formats viewed. When responding 

        to the question, test subjects were presented with five different five-point 

        Likert scales with response categories ranging from "very difficult" (1) 

        to "very easy" (5). </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Note: Book Page and Photograph formats were shown in 

        black and white. Original, Digital Image, and Slide formats were shown 

        in color.</p>

      <p class=normal>Table 3 presents the statistics obtained in response to 

        question 4. Recast, test subjects rated the formats on the relative ease 

        or difficulty of identifying emotions in specific formats as follows: 

        original (4.5), color slide (3.7), black-and-white photo (3.0), digital 

        image (2.9), and book page (2.8). The statistics suggest clear differences 

        with regard to the relative ease of identifying emotion in certain formats, 

        with a real convergence of opinion (manifested as a low standard deviation) 

        only with regard to original works of art. The findings of this analysis 

        are significant at the .00 level. </p>

      <p class=normal>The qualitative comments that accompanied these responses 

        included much discussion about the shortcomings of responding to the emotional 

        content in black-and-white images, a strong preference for large vs. small 

        images, and a preponderance of comments about digital images:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Digital images on a computer screen<span> 3/4 </span>The 

        contrast to color (or light and dark) was missing, which plays a large 

        role in the representation of emotion. The human element or connection 

        was missing. </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Computerized images<span> 3/4 </span>liked the color 

        but felt too distanced from the art.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I think black and white formats have an inherent glumness 

        or "negative" feeling; digital images seem the most distant, though, because 

        of their size and my inability to really "get into" them.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Computer images<span> 3/4 </span>clarity and color not 

        as vivid<span> 3/4 </span>the screen, keyboard, apparatus is distracting.</p>

      <p class=normal>Ultimately, test subjects found the task of identifying 

        feelings and emotions easiest when interacting with an original work of 

        art. As one subject observed,</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I think the only way to experience a work is to see 

        it firsthand<span> 3/4 </span>when one looks at a reproduction, one can 

        only respond to the forms and situations (within the work); I believe 

        the real emotion is only given off by experiencing a work in its own totality.</p>

      <p class=normal>Question 5 of part II of the study asked subjects to evaluate 

        how intensely they experienced feelings and emotions when viewing the 

        five test formats. When responding to the question, test subjects were 

        presented with five five-point Likert scales with response categories 

        ranging from "not very intensely" (1) to "very intensely" (5). Table 4 

        presents the statistics obtained in response to question 5. Recast, test 

        subjects rated the formats on the relative intensity of emotion experienced 

        as follows: original art (4.5), color slide (3.5), digital image and black-and-white 

        photograph (2.7), and book page (2.6). The findings are significant at 

        the .00 level. The power of the formats that used color to evoke an emotional 

        response are clear here; it is likely that digital images might have placed 

        higher had a larger monitor been available for use in the study. Table 

        4 presents the statistics obtained in response to question 5.</p>

      <p class=normal>The qualitative responses that accompanied question 5 suggest 

        a host of influences<span> 3/4 </span>some physical, some emotional or 

        spiritual in nature<span> 3/4 </span>that contribute to intensifying viewer 

        responses to pictures. Among the most notable physical factors are scale, 

        size of the image being viewed, and both richness and fidelity of color. 

        Those positively responding to the oil on canvas format suggest other, 

        intriguing reasons for their heightened response:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I could easily look closely or move back and see the 

        whole image from a distance or in conjunction with its surroundings.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>There's nothing that can replace, to me, an original. 

        The colors and their variation, the light, and its reflection<span> 3/4 

        </span>none of that "value" is as engaging in a format other than the 

        real one. Slides are nice, digitals are good, but there's an interaction 

        that comes only with the original work<span> 3/4 </span>a presence.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I think seeing the created object first hand reminded 

        me of its creator. This is not to say biography, etc., just that it has 

        a maker, and that [the] maker presumably had intent, intensified the viewing.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>When viewing the oil on canvas pictures I felt a personal 

        connection between the artist and the subjects and myself.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Oil on canvas gave me a feeling of closeness to the

      <p class=normal>Question 6 of part II of the study asked subjects to assess 

        the four surrogate formats in their ability to re-create the feeling of 

        looking at an oil on canvas painting. When responding to the question, 

        test subjects were presented with four five-point Likert scales with response 

        categories ranging from "not very successful" (1) to "very successful" 

        (5). Table 5 presents the statistics obtained in response to question 

        6. Recast, test subjects rated the formats on the relative ability to 

        re-create the feeling of looking at an oil on canvas painting as follows: 

        color slide (3.6), digital image (2.7), book page (2.5), and black-and-white 

        photograph (2.2). The findings are significant at the .00 level. The responses 

        here almost exactly mirror the responses gathered in the previous question 

        (with the single exception of black-and-white photographs) and serve to 

        reconfirm both sets of findings, i.e. that color slides are perceived 

        to be the single format "most like" oil on canvas paintings, with the 

        other three surrogate formats trailing at by a considerable distance.

      <p class=MsoCaption>Note: Book Page and Photograph formats were shown in 

        black and white. Original, Digital Image, and Slide formats were shown 

        in color.</p>

      <p class=normal>This was the first question in which test subjects were 

        asked to make direct comparisons across all five formats. This forced 

        ranking supports findings that were suggested by previous questions in 

        part II of the test: oil on canvas originals are clearly perceived to 

        be best able to impart feeling and emotion. Color slides, once again, 

        place strongly, but book pages and black-and-white photographs trail significantly 

        behind all other formats.</p>

      <p class=normal>As has been mentioned, demographic data with regard to gender, 

        computer use, and museum attendance was gathered near the end of the part 

        II survey. Eighty-six individuals participated in the Toledo Picture Study: 

        75% of test subjects were female, 25 % were male.<b> </b>In response to 

        the question "How often do you use a computer to search the World Wide 

        Web?," test subjects provided answers on a five-point scale (with 1 indicating 

        "never" and 5 indicating "daily"). The mean response was 3.7 (a value 

        falling within the "monthly" category), with a standard deviation of 1.4, 

        suggesting not much regular web viewing but a certain polarization of 

        tendencies within the test group. In response to the final demographic 

        question, "How often do you visit museums?" test subjects provided answers 

        on a five-point scale (with 1 indicating "this is my first visit to a 

        museum" and 5 indicating "5 or more times a year"). The mean response 

        was 3.9 (a value falling within the "1-2 times a year" category), with 

        a standard deviation of 1.0, suggesting that a least half the study might 

        be characterized as frequent museum visitors. Attempts to correlate gender, 

        computer use, and museum attendance with responses given to the survey 

        questions failed to identify any relationships that might exist at statistically 

        significant levels. This was not anticipated in this study's hypotheses 

        nor is it what has been suggested by the findings of other studies which 

        have suggested that at least frequent museum attendance has an effect 

        on one's ability to interpret art (Eversmann, Krill, Michael, Twiss-Garrity, 

        and Beck, 1997). While this doesn't compromise the results observed 

        in the Toledo Picture Study, it does leave certain observed phenomena 

        needing explanation.</p>

      <p class=normal>In all, however, statistical findings from the test provide 

        consistent and persuasive support for the research hypotheses advanced 

        earlier. Responses to the final question of the survey, which asked test 

        subjects to offer any final observations about the five presentation formats, 

        leaves little doubt as to where they stand:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I am here from Cincinnati to see fine art originals. 

        Could have just sent for a museum collection catalogue if pictures were 

        enough. But, they never are. The soul of the artist is only seen by standing 

        in front of the work.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>After viewing the reproductions, which were of good 

        quality, the impact of the originals is overwhelming!</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>I noticed immediately how quickly and how much more 

        excited I was about generating emotions while viewing the oil on canvas 

        works in the gallery. I was disappointed about how quickly that portion 

        went because it was so much more exhilarating.</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>.....</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>The real thing is the real thing. The rest is second 

        rate.<b></b></p>

      <h1>Interpretation of Findings</h1>

      <p class=normal>Given the fact that data analysis is still underway on part 

        I of the study data, it is, of course, premature to offer any conclusive 

        statements. Part II of the study data does suggest that<span> 3/4 </span>in 

        any number of ways<span> 3/4 </span>Toledo Picture Study test subjects 

        do, in fact, make distinctions in the nature of their response to original 

        works of art and surrogate representations. Test data show that statistically 

        significant differences exist with regard to the intensity of the emotions 

        they feel, the ease with which they identify feelings and emotions, and 

        in terms of the ability of an original work of art to convey feeling or 

        emotion. The qualitative data suggests that such distinctions are most 

        often discussed in terms of the easily observed physical differences that 

        exist between surrogates and original works of art, i.e. relative size, 

        scale, and richness and fidelity of color, with black and white reproductions 

        suffering considerably in comparison with both originals works of art 

        and other surrogates shown in color. </p>

      <p class=normal>The most interesting qualitative data directly addresses 

        differences between original works of art and surrogates in terms of the 

        emotional experience or at least in terms of their personal response. 

        These responses, in particular those that mentioned the effect of the 

        gallery's parquet floors and deeply-hued walls, the presence of others 

        in the gallery, or those individuals who shared stories of past experiences 

        at the museum as children, with their families, or as volunteers, all 

        point to exciting new directions for future investigation. This research 

        has focused almost entirely on differences that exist within the physical 

        object; future studies might be well served to look at the gallery itself 

        and it's effect on the way individuals respond to the physical object. 

        Perhaps the differences that have shown themselves in this study may be 

        explained more easily by focusing on people, not artifacts. </p>

      <h1>Significance of the Study</h1>

      <p class=normal>This study should offer findings of significant interest 

        to those seeking to expand access to museum and visual resource collections 

        to non-specialist users. The process of testing on multiple surrogate 

        types is expected to suggest which formats best convey the essence of 

        a work to those individuals searching without the benefit of expert language 

        or a knowledge of artists, art historical periods, or artistic styles. 

        This should allow those developing systems or sites intending to serve 

        general audiences to gain special insight on how to develop their resources 

        in ways that will be most responsive to their viewers. Resulting innovations 

        might take the form of special user interfaces, the inclusion of additional 

        search fields, or additional guides or search support designed for non-specialists. 

        Similarly, findings about expressional qualities might provide specific 

        direction on how to enhance existing systems for more effective use not 

        only by non-specialists but by others for whom such access might be highly 

        desirable, e.g. those looking for images for use in advertising or design. 

        Finally, the ability to extend access to the vast audience that exists 

        beyond art history scholars and museum professionals not only serves to 

        advance greater educational, cultural, and societal goals, but serves 

        to restore this body of documentation to the greater public from which 

        it originated. </p>
