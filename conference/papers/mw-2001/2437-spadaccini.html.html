      <p class=PaperTitle>Streaming Audio and Video: New Challenges and Opportunities 

        for Museums</p>

      <p class=Author>Jim Spadaccini, Ideum, USA</p>

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Streaming audio and video present new challenges and 

        opportunities for museums. Streaming media is easier to author and deliver 

        to Internet audiences than ever before; digital video editing is commonplace 

        now that the tools -- computers, digital video cameras, and hard drives 

        -- are so affordable; the cost of serving video files across the Internet 

        has also significantly decreased. The initial growth of the World Wide 

        Web was driven by the ease of authoring Web pages, the affordability of 

        the medium, and the potential to reach large audiences. The same conditions 

        are now in place for streaming audio and video, and we're just beginning 

        to see the widespread use of the technology.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The challenges and opportunities presented to museums 

        today are similar to those that existed when the World Wide Web first 

        became popular. Many questions raised are the same: Can this technology 

        be used to expand the museum experience? Are there ways to take advantage 

        of the "two-way" nature of the Internet? A few museums have already experimented 

        with streaming media and some lessons have been learned. However, presentation 

        methods and the technology itself continue to evolve. This paper shares 

        experiences with streaming media (focusing on streaming video), and discusses 

        some possible new directions for effective use of the medium within online 

        museum environments.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class=normal>Ten years ago Apple Computers Inc. released QuickTime, a 

        digital video and animation system. At about the same time the World Wide 

        Web was developed at CERN in Switzerland. These technologies converged 

        in 1995 when the first QuickTime movies appeared on the Web and when the 

        first streaming media format (Real Network's RealAudio) was released. 

        No longer an oddity on the Web, digital video has now become commonplace. 

        Most digital video and audio now developed for the Web is in a "streaming" 

        format, meaning that the entire file or large portions of the file don't 

        need to be downloaded in order for the users to view or listen to its 

        contents. </p>

      <h1>Streaming Media Drives the Internet</h1>

      <p class=normal>The growth and reach of streaming media continues to hit 

        all-time highs. According to statistics (<a href="http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/" target="new">http://www.Nielsen-NetRatings.com</a>), 

        35 million Web users accessed streaming content in November of 2000 from 

        their homes. This represents a 65 % increase from November 1999. The same 

        study found that streaming media increased to 36% among all Internet users. 

        This figure compared to a reach of 28% of all Internet users the year 

        before. A November 2000 study by MeasureCast (<a href="http://www.measurecast.com/" target="new">http://www.measurecast.com</a>) 

        and Harris Interactive (<a href="http://www.harrisinteractive.com/" target="new">http://www.harrisinteractive.com</a>) 

        found these figures to be even higher, with 57% of online users found 

        to be using streaming media weekly.</p>

      <p class=normal>Citing ease of use, availability of content, and growth 

        of bandwidth, a study by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray (<a href="http://www.piperjaffray.com/" target="new">http://www.piperjaffray.com</a>) 

        suggests that streaming media will be the next "macro-growth driver" on 

        the Internet. The growth of broadband has been well documented. According 

        to Gartner Group's Dataquest Inc. (<a href="http://www.dataquest.com/" target="new">http://www.dataquest.com</a>), 

        six million US customers signed up for high-speed Internet access in 2000, 

        bringing the total number of broadband users to 11 million. This represents 

        about 9% of all US users. While this is a small percentage overall, it 

        represents significant growth. Last year, according to the Computer Industry 

        Almanac (<a href="http://www.c-i-a.com/" target="new">http://www. c-i-a.com</a>), 

        the figure was a mere 3% of home users.</p>

      <p class=normal>High-speed Internet access is not essential for streaming 

        media but it does enhance the user's experience. As detailed in "Creating 

        Online Experiences in Broadband Environments" (<a

href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw2000/papers/spadaccini/spadaccini.html" target="new">http://www.archimuse.com/mw2000/papers/spadaccini/spadaccini.html</a>), 

        users get more data throughput, which means better quality video, more 

        frames-per-second, a larger image, better quality audio, and less "lossy" 

        compression. Also, users with a broadband connection (56kbps or faster) 

        are 50% more likely to access streaming media than users with slower (56kbps 

        or slower) connections, this according to Nielsen-NetRatings (<a href="http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/" target="new">http://www.Nielsen-NetRatings.com</a>).</p>

      <h1>Easier and Cheaper All the Time</h1>

      <p class=normal>The tools for creating streaming media continue to get easier 

        to use and cheaper to purchase. DV<b> </b>video gear, computers, and software 

        are more affordable and easier to use. Many home users and students have 

        begun making their own digital videos. The tools for shooting professional-looking 

        digital video have never been cheaper. A $3,000 camera now has the same 

        resolution that a $30,000 camera had just five years ago. Desktop video 

        systems are commonplace. The success of the iMac and their free iMovie 

        software is a good indication of this trend. </p>

      <p class=normal>The tools for streaming video, server software in particular, 

        continues to decline in price. This is due in part to competition between 

        three companies: RealNetwork's RealMedia was the standard until in 

        the last two or three years, Microsoft's Windows Media and Apple's 

        streaming QuickTime entered the market. Microsoft's server software 

        is now built into Windows 2000 and Apple's QuickTime Streaming Server 

        is included in the Mac OS X Server. Both of these products cost less than 

        $1,000.</p>

      <p class=normal>In addition, the number of ISPs (Internet Service Providers) 

        who offer streaming media services continues to expand. Bandwidth costs 

        have declined and competition has eroded the cost of delivering streams 

        to Web visitors. All of these trends take streaming media out of the experimental 

        realm. Even with its limitations (small window size, poor video quality), 

        streaming media is quickly becoming a viable way to reach Internet audiences.</p>

      <h1>Museum Visitors</h1>

      <p class=normal>Specific information about museum Web visitors is difficult 

        to find since the medium is still so new. The only study examining connection 

        speed and streaming media is "Who's Out There? A Pilot User Study of Educational 

        Web Resources by the Science Learning Network (SLN)" (<a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw2000/papers/semper/semper.html" target="new">http://www.archimuse.com/mw2000/papers/semper/semper.html</a> 

        ) found that "a significant percentage of visitors (14 to 22%) now have 

        access at speeds faster than 56k." While this study used a small sampling--about 

        50,000 visitors over a one-month period--it did study three different 

        Web sites: The Exploratorium, The Franklin Institute, and Science Museum 

        (NMSI) in London. </p>

      <p class=normal>About 22% of visitors accessed these museum resources from 

        school and about 10% visited the sites from work environments. It's 

        likely that a larger percentage of these visitors were accessing with 

        high-speed connections. This might help explain the discrepancy between 

        the broadband figures from the Gartner Group's Dataquest Inc. study, 

        that found 9% of users connecting at 56kbps or greater, and the figures 

        from the SLN Pilot User Study. </p>

      <p class=normal>The SLN Pilot User Study also asked visitors whether they 

        viewed one or more multimedia clips: 23% stated they did. While it's 

        difficult to draw too many conclusions from this one figure taken from 

        only three resources (and considering that only two of the three resources 

        contained streaming media), it's at least an indication that a significant 

        percentage of museum Web visitors were actively interacting with streaming 

        media in 1999. So that from this somewhat limited data, one could infer 

        that the number of Web visitors to museums who can access streaming media 

        continues to grow (as it certainly has in the general Internet population). 

      </p>

      <h1>Expanding the Museum Experience</h1>

      <p class=normal>The complex question of how to present streaming video remains. 

        Obviously, the answers are subjective.<b> </b>Streaming media can be presented 

        either live, or more commonly, on demand. Each type of streaming media 

        requires different presentation methods to effectively reach Web audiences. 

        On-demand video has offered much more variety, while most museum Webcasts 

        have been presented in very straightforward ways, with the developers 

        concentrating on the more complex technical and programmatic aspects of 

        producing and delivering the live video stream.</p>

      <h1>On Demand</h1>

      <p class=normal>In early 1997, while working at the Exploratorium, the author 

        developed a resource called "The Science of Hockey&quot; (<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/hockey" target="new">http://www.exploratorium.edu/hockey</a>), 

        the first in a series of sport science Websites developed over the next 

        two years. Permission was granted to interview local professional hockey 

        team, the San Jose Sharks. It was perfect timing as the first streaming 

        video format, RealVideo, had just been released. </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="spadaccini.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="367" alt="Figure 1. The Science of Hockey "></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1. The Science of Hockey </p>

      <p class=normal>There was no question that the video had to be presented 

        within the context of a text- and image-based site. This had little to 

        do (in the thinking at the time) with creating a context for the video, 

        but rather the reality that most users would not have the technical equipment 

        to view the video. The clips that appear in the site were thought of as 

        "bonus" materials, available to those who at the time were on the cutting 

        edge of Internet technology.</p>

      <p class=normal>The clips were short--from 45 seconds to about four 

        minutes. From a technical standpoint, entire video interviews could have 

        been presented; instead clips that matched the topics in each part of 

        the site were created. The length of the video clips provided flexibility, 

        allowing users to choose which clips they wanted to view and in what sequence.</p>

      <p class=normal>In looking back, this formula worked fairly well. The reality 

        was, and still is, that the Internet is primarily a text- and image-based 

        medium and that Web sites can be explored in a non-linear fashion. This 

        same formula was used for many resources on a variety of topics: "The 

        Science of Baseball" (<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/baseball" target="new">http://www.exploratorium.edu/baseball</a>), 

        "The Science of Cycling" (<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/cycling" target="new">http://www.exploratorium.edu/cycling</a>), 

        "Sunspots" (<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/sunspots" target="new">http://www.exploratorium.edu/sunspots</a>), 

        "Frogs" (<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/frogs" target="new">http://www.exploratorium.edu/frogs</a>), 

        and "The Faultine" (<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/faultline" target="new">http://www.exploratorium.edu/faultline</a>). 

        These sites used text and graphics to tell the story, and video and other 

        media to enhance it. This format provides end users with options: they 

        can read the story, print it out, skim the text, look at the images, or 

        just view the video clips. Most news organizations and variety of other 

        content sites take similar approaches.</p>

      <p class=normal>Recently Ideum helped create a site called "Robotics: Sensing, 

        Thinking, Acting" (<a href="http://www.thethech.org/robotics" target="new">http://www.thethech.org/robotics</a>) 

        for the Tech Museum of Innovation. Four features were created for this 

        site. Three of the four used streaming media, presented differently in 

        each feature. In one section, video was used in much same way it was done 

        in the Science of Hockey: an article with images, video, and other media 

        used together to tell the story. For another section audio clips create 

        a context for an interactive discussion area focusing on robotics and 

        ethics. The "Robot Art" feature relies heavily on streaming video, to 

        enable the artists themselves, and their work, to be the primary focus. 

        The section contains streaming video interviews with the artists, images 

        of their work, and QuickTime VR (360-degree panoramas) of the artists 

        in their studios. The video clips are short, one to three minutes each, 

        and the corresponding text briefly describes the subject of the clip. 

        These clips, along with additional media resources, provide a variety 

        of choices for the Web visitor.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2. Robot Art</p>

      <p class=normal>An excellent site that makes use of on-demand video is the 

        "The Living Room Candidate "(<a href="http://www.ammi.org/livingroomcandidate" target="new">http://www.ammi.org/livingroomcandidate</a>). 

        The site focuses primarily on political advertisements that ran during 

        presidential campaigns from 1952 to 1996. The ads are presented as separate 

        streaming video clips. Additional materials consist of a short introductory 

        text, a larger program, an educational guide, and thumbnail images from 

        the videos. The additional materials help explain and enhance the video, 

        provide historical context, point out themes, and create a richer experience. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>These examples use additional media elements to complement 

        streaming video. In the case of "The Science of Hockey," for example, 

        on-demand video is used within a text- and graphics-based story. The video 

        is not required to tell the story. Whereas both "Robot Art" and "The Living 

        Room Candidate" rely much more heavily on the user's ability to view streaming 

        video. All the examples use short video clips that provide flexibility 

        in what the user views, and in what sequence. Live Webcasts have not provided 

        the end-user with this sort of flexibility until now. Nor has the addition 

        of other media elements to Webcasting been focused on. <b></b></p>

      <h1>Live Webcasts</h1>

      <p class=normal>In most cases, video-on-demand is just one of a variety 

        of media types used to tell a story. A Webcast, on the other hand, has 

        been viewed as an end in itself. Many times little thought is given to 

        how other media elements could enhance the Web user's experience. Considering 

        the technical, organizational, and programmatic complexity involved in 

        presenting live Webcasts it's not surprising. But despite the limitations 

        of medium (poor video quality and the small window size), exploring other 

        ways of improving the end-user's experience would seem to be the 

        next logical step.<b></b></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 3. Exploratorium Eclipse Telecom/Internet Schematic. 

        This schematic demonstrates the technical challenges involved in the most 

        complex Webcasts. </p>

      <p class=normal>Live Webcasts can bring the museum floor to remote visitors 

        or remote locations to the museum and Web visitors. At the Exploratorium, 

        the author was involved, to one degree or another, in about two dozen 

        Webcasts. To date, the Exploratorium has presented over fifty Webcasts.</p>

      <p class=normal>The 1999 Eclipse Webcast (<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse" target="new">http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse</a>) 

        was easily the most popular Webcast (to both Web and museum audiences) 

        the Exploratorium ever presented. The ingredients for success largely 

        had to do with the structure of the program. First, it presented a unique 

        phenomenon, a total solar eclipse. Second, it presented a live video signal 

        from an exotic remote location, in this case, Turkey. Promotion efforts 

        and media hype about the eclipse helped drive traffic to the site. The 

        event itself was an excellent vehicle for exploring the science and history 

        surrounding eclipses. On the museum floor, the "Webcast" studio and surrounding 

        areas were packed with visitors who by all accounts greatly enjoyed the 

        Webcast. On the Web, our visitors enjoyed the event, too, but the museum 

        visitors a more universally favorable impression.</p>

      <p class=normal>In 1999, the Exploratorium produced a Webcast on the <i>Science 

        of Chocolate</i> (<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/chocolate" target="new">http://www.exploratorium.edu/chocolate</a>) 

        for Valentine's Day. The event was hugely popular on the museum floor. 

        Well over 500 people visited and the museum sold a record number of museum 

        memberships; but on the Web, the event was not as popular as anticipated. 

        For obvious reasons, meeting scientists, pastry chefs, and chocolatiers, 

        and getting to sample chocolate was much more appealing to museum visitors 

        than to Web visitors. In addition, museum visitors seemed to enjoy the 

        two-hour format, but Web visitors didn't stick around to watch the 

        entire show. Similar criticism was offered from some Web visitors<b> </b>about 

        the length of the Eclipse Webcast, which was also two hours in length.</p>

      <p class=normal>Just how long a Webcast should be is a difficult question 

        to answer. The average duration of a Web visit to the educational resources 

        examined in "Who's Out There? A Pilot User Study of Educational Web Resources"<u> 

        </u>was about eight minutes. Webcasting can hold visitors' attention for 

        longer periods of time, but at the Exploratorium, the number of viewers 

        frequently dropped off during the course of a broadcast. </p>

      <p class=normal>Another factor is how people use their computers. Few people 

        regularly use their computers to view lengthy movies or TV shows (even 

        when they can fill the entire screen, which DVD players can do). Generally, 

        computers are used in active ways, working, surfing, clicking around--it's 

        a lot to ask of a viewer, to sit at a computer for two hours and just 

        watch the screen, particularly when the size of the video window is so 

        small. </p>

      <p class=normal>Almost every Webcast I've been a part of has worked 

        very well as a museum event. Visitors to the museum floor can communicate 

        with each other and with scientists or other guests; they can watch videos 

        or demonstrations, and interact in other ways. If the presentation on 

        the Web could somehow be more dynamic, perhaps by injecting other types 

        of media, or by somehow involving users more actively in the Webcast, 

        they might stick around longer and the experience might be richer. In 

        other words, perhaps there is a way to replicate the qualities of the 

        museum experience for remote Webcast viewers.</p>

      <p class=normal>In retrospect, the "Webcast pages" for the Eclipse and Chocolate 

        events could have been much more dynamic. Both pages work in the same 

        way (and in fact, are similar to most other Exploratorium Webcast pages). 

        The user clicks on a link launching an external player that shows the 

        video. These pages took a great deal of time to develop, making sure that 

        links to "help pages" were easy to find, linking to other resources, and 

        creating a "look and feel" that enhanced the presentation of the topic. 

        The problem with the design is one of function rather than one of form. 

      </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="spadaccini.fig4.jpg" width="400" height="351" alt="Figure 4. Solar Eclipse Page. The Exploratorium's Solar Eclipse Webcast page hosted by Yahoo! Broadcast. "></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 4. Solar Eclipse Page. The Exploratorium's

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="spadaccini.fig5.jpg" width="400" height="326" alt="Figure 5. The Exploratorium's Sweet Science of Chocolate Webcast Page."></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 5. The Exploratorium's Sweet Science of 

        Chocolate Webcast Page.</p>

      <p class=normal>Both sites contain images and text-based information that 

        provide background information and create a context for the Webcast. Additional 

        resources greatly add to the visitor's experience. They could generate 

        anticipation for events yet to come, and provide some longevity to the 

        sites, bringing visitors back well after the excitement of live events 

        has dissipated. This approach was developed while experimenting with on-demand 

        video.</p>

      <p class=normal>Unfortunately, there was never the time to develop a method 

        to allow visitors to browse these resources (or to "push" additional media 

        types) during a live event. Here's what would happen: When a Webcast viewer 

        wanted to explore these additional resources, their video window would 

        disappear behind the browser window. These resources could be used before 

        or after the event--but not during. Unlike sites that use on-demand 

        video, you'll miss some of the live Webcast program if you try to 

        view these additional materials. </p>

      <p class=normal>Both the Eclipse event and the Sweet Science of Chocolate 

        did allow users to email questions, which provided a limited feedback 

        mechanism. A better method was chat areas, but again these were separate 

        links that if clicked on sent the user's video window behind the browser 

        window. For many visitors the Webcast experience was a solitary one, with 

        no interaction with other visitors or with the producers or guests of 

        the event.</p>

      <h1>The Webcast Viewer: A Possible Method For of Presenting Live Video</h1>

      <p class=normal>Most Webcasting examples work in similar ways to the Exploratorium 

        Webcast pages. The focus has been primarily on the video stream itself. 

        Rarely have museums experimented with two-way communication such as chat 

        or messaging during Webcasts. Keeping in mind how most Web visitors seem 

        to use their computers, I've given some thought to an alternative 

        way of presenting museum Webcasts, one that would make additional materials 

        available and that could incorporate user participation and interaction, 

        all of this while not interrupting a continuous program stream. </p>

      <p class=normal>Some streaming media service providers and Application Service 

        Providers (ASPs) have or are in the process of developing custom interfaces 

        for business presentations. For example, Presenter.com (<a href="http://www.presenter.com/" target="new">http://www.presenter.com</a>) 

        uses a pop-up window that allows the user to view a video stream and slide 

        presentation. Obviously, for business presentations, this is a must. Certainly 

        the addition of a similar feature could help enhance museum Webcasts for 

        Internet audiences.</p>

      <p class=normal>An interesting real-time messaging system called SPARC (Space 

        Physics &amp; Aeronomy Research Collaboratory (<a href="http://sparc-1.si.umich.edu/sparc/central/page/SPARC">http://sparc-1.si.umich.edu/sparc/central/page/SPARC</a>) 

        deserves mention, too. It enables Web visitors to chat on a page in real-time. 

        On the site, others who are visiting the page are visible, either as guests 

        (with no chat abilities) or as registered users (with the ability to chat). 

        This is similar to popular sites that use Java IRC.</p>

      <p class=normal>Inspired by these interesting examples, the author has developed 

        a mock-up of a proposed "Webcast Viewer." It incorporates the slide area 

        and a messaging feature, along with an embedded video window into a pop-up 

        browser window. Frames are used to present the different features within 

        the window.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><a name="fig6"></a><a href="spadaccinifig6.html"><img src="spadaccini.fig6.400.jpg" width="400" height="233" alt="Figure 6. The " webcast viewer" """ border="0"></a></p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 6. The " Webcast Viewer" </p>

      <p class=normal>The embedded video screen can support a variety of connection 

        speeds. The mock-up incorporates a Windows Media player, but RealMedia 

        or QuickTime could be used instead. </p>

      <p class=normal>There is an area for slides or text, a window that could 

        support any HTML document. A scrolling feature could also be added. A 

        "zoom" feature could be used to allow visitors to examine details of the 

        materials presented. An "edit" feature would allow users to set preferences 

        such as image types or sizes. Additional links (which appear as "Slide 

        1" etc.) could permit users to browse slides, or the slides could be "pushed" 

        automatically as the Webcast proceeded. This could be done with a CGI 

        (Common Gateway Interface) script, Javascript, or Java applet. Thumbnails 

        of the images could also be used within the window.</p>

      <p class=normal>The slide area could provide space for animations, or even 

        applications. Obviously, this would require additional resources for development. 

        Flash, Shockwave, or Java technology could be used. This route would require 

        that the end-user have the proper browser or plug-ins to view or interact 

        with the file, but it could certainly add a new dimension to a live Webcast. 

        The real benefit of a slide area for museum presentations is that artwork 

        or scientific charts could be shown at an adequate size for visitors to 

        properly see the details. </p>

      <p class=normal>The bottom of the figure contains a Webcast messaging frame 

        that allows users to chat with other visitors and/or museum personnel. 

        Registered users would have chat privileges while unregistered user could 

        &quot;lurk,&quot; that is, observe the chat without participating. The 

        "edit" feature would allow users to change their names and/or other information. 

        The chat area could be moderated, although registration would provide 

        a degree of protection from unwanted graffiti. </p>

      <p class=normal>The window would serve the important purpose of displaying 

        the number of individuals who are tuned in to the Webcast. Currently, 

        viewing is a solitary experience with no indication that others are watching 

        or viewing the event with you. During small events visitors could chat 

        and carry on conversations about the topics presented by Webcast. With 

        large-scale events it would very difficult to carry a conversation, but 

        viewers might be able to influence the direction of the Webcast with their 

        comments, which also might be of interest to other online visitors.</p>

      <h1>Technical Issues </h1>

      <p class=normal>The technology exists to create a working version the Webcast 

        Viewer presented. (It should be mentioned that this was not always the 

        case. The "embedded" video screen was not well supported on some platforms 

        and with some older versions of browsers.) The Webcast viewer simply combines 

        a number of existing technologies in one pop-up browser window using frames. 

      </p>

      <p class=normal>The question of bandwidth is a tougher one to answer. Sending 

        additional text and/or images may interrupt streams for some users connected 

        at slower speeds. Webcast streams bit rates may need to be reduced to 

        allow for more "overhead," insuring that the viewer could receive additional 

        media without interrupting the continuous stream. In addition, the "edit" 

        options for both the slide and message features could contain preferences 

        to limit the size or the number of times the screens "refresh." Another 

        approach might preload slides or images allowing users to store them locally 

        before the Webcast begins.</p>

      <h1>The Archive</h1>

      <p class=normal>Most Webcasts are archived, leaving an on-demand clip usually 

        of the entire presentation. With the Webcast Viewer, archives could be 

        shown in much the same way the live broadcasts were. School groups or 

        other organizations could visit the archive at the same time using the 

        built-in messaging system to communicate during their visit.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class=normal>Resources that are flexible and that give visitors choices 

        in how they interact with streaming media seems to work best. Multiple 

        media types provide the user with options on how to use the resource and 

        work around the technical limitations that many users have in viewing 

        streaming media. Webcasting is much more technically and programmatically 

        complex than producing on-demand clips. While Webcast events have been 

        very successful on the museum floor, informal feedback suggests that the 

        experience on the Internet has been mixed. </p>

      <p class=normal>On the floor, visitors can interact with each other and 

        can watch a variety of demonstrations that are occasionally presented 

        simultaneously. As a possible solution, the Webcast Viewer attempts to 

        incorporate some of the features that make "in person" museum Webcast 

        events so appealing, by creating a multimedia experience and providing 

        the potential for user interaction. Some of these qualities are the same 

        ones that seem to work in presenting on-demand video. The Webcast Viewer 

        could present users with choices, making Webcasts more interactive and 

        more compelling. </p>

      <p class=normal>The reality is that, from a technical standpoint, streaming 

        media is not going be "TV quality" any time soon. While the promise of 

        broadband will eventually change the situation, it will be years before 

        Webcasting can compete with television and even then it will not be universally 

        implemented. Recognition of this went into thinking about how the Webcast 

        Viewer might be designed. Incorporating additional media elements and 

        some sort of a "two-way" mechanism will surely enrich the visitor experience. 

        Otherwise the Internet is just a broadcast medium and not a very robust 

        one at that.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Webcast Viewer is that it could be used as a "turn-key" 

        solution--used over and over again to support a variety of Webcasts 

        and topics. ASPs like Presenter.com are trying to do just that, mostly 

        for business applications. The design and technical specifications of 

        the Webcast Viewer could be modified and improved after each broadcast.</p>

      <p class=normal>Perhaps as more museums begin to experiment with Webcasting, 

        new approaches will be developed. In the last two years, several museums 

        have conducted Webcasts, among them the Canadian Museum of Civilization 

        (<a href="http://www.civilization.ca/membrs/theatre/iqqaip1e.html" target="new">http://www.civilization.ca/membrs/theatre/iqqaip1e.html</a>), 

        the Franklin Institute (<a href="http://webevents.broadcast.com/unisys/fi042700/register.asp">http://webevents.broadcast.com/unisys/fi042700/register.asp</a>), 

        the Denver Museum of Natural History (<a href="http://event.webcasts.com/dmnh2000/event.html">http://event.webcasts.com/dmnh2000/event.html</a>), 

        and the Cleveland Museum of Art (<a href="http://www.clevelandart.org/byzantine/webcast.htm" target="new">http://www.clevelandart.org/byzantine/webcast.htm</a>). 

        It will be exciting to see what the next few years will bring, as more 

        museums venture into this arena.</p>

      <p class=normal>The Webcast Viewer is just one way of visualizing what could 

        be done to make Webcasting more appealing to museum Web visitors. Any 

        method for delivering other types of media along with a video stream would 

        help make the experience for online visitors more informative and more 

        exciting. Taking advantage of the unique two-way nature of the Internet 

        would help make Webcasts a more engaging, less solitary experience for 

        remote museum visitors. The technical elements to make this possible are 

        already out there. Perhaps it's time to begin the experiment.<b></b></p>
