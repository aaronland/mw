<h3>Digital Image Managers for the New Millennium:

A Museum / University Collaboration</h3>

  

<a href="../../bios/au_2873.html"><b>S. K. Hastings</b></a>, University of North Texas, USA<p>



<h3>Introduction</h3>



The University of North Texas in Denton and the African American Museum in Dallas, Texas are partners in a program designed to produce a cadre of experts for the field of digital image management.  The School of Library and Information Sciences received a grant from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services to build a digital imaging laboratory, make the Museum collection available on the Web and provide fellowships for students in an Advanced Certificate of Study Program.  The School of Visual Arts adds experience in museum education, use of computers in art and aids in the digitization of images throughout the program.  The project includes the production of digital images, digital information database creation and management with a focus on advanced network and information technologies.  The production and management of digital images and the management of digital information are important skill sets for current and future museum information professionals.  In addition, the program prepares individuals to assume positions as experts in the broader markets of libraries, archives and information centers.   An integral part of the educational experience for the students enrolled in the program is the opportunity to work as interns at the African American Museum and other area museums.  One result of the project is improved access to a majority of the museum's collection by making images and information about the collection available through the Web.<p>



The project produces a model for training professionals in the creation, use and management of digital images.  The project also produces a model of collaboration between museums and universities.   In addition, the project provides the opportunity to assess the impact that improved access to a museum collection may have.<p>



Information has become a critical resource in most facets of American society, and education for the information professions has become strategic for the development of a healthy information economy and the preservation of democracy.  Digital image and information management is a subset of this much larger construct.  In order to compete and lead in a global economic environment we must have experts capable of planning, implementing and managing projects that increase and improve access to our cultural heritage.  This project produces a model for the education and training of digital image and information managers and focuses attention on the importance of digital information.  In addition, the project brings attention to an excellent collection of African American art and helps improve access to the museum collection.<p>

 

Part of the design and plan of action for the project focuses on gathering data to produce a model program of study for the management of digital images.  Data are also collected to support the development of a model for how museums and universities may collaborate.  The models produced are generalizable to the population of state-supported universities, other schools of library and information Sciences, and museums.<p>



<h3>Design</h3>



The general approach of this project is based on a program of study to produce professionals with a specialty in digital image management.  The plan of action is based on goals and objectives and periodic evaluation.  The project also includes a summative evaluation report reflecting how well the project met measurable outcomes.<p>

<h3>Technical Knowledge</h3>



Technical expertise is demonstrated in two areas.  First, the construction of the digital imaging laboratory and second in the management of digital image databases.  The School of Library and Information Sciences maintains two electronic classrooms with video-conferencing equipment, a teaching computer classroom with 20 networked workstations and a general graduate access lab with 18 stations.  The School employs a full-time LAN and technology manager, a part-time Webmaster and various graduate assistants with specialties in technology management.  In addition, the current director of Academic Computing Services is an adjunct faculty member of the School.  The School is nationally known for its technical opportunities and our graduates are consistently placed in information technology management positions.<p>



<h3>Summary</h3>



As an educational experience, one of the most unique features of the project is made possible by the cooperation between a museum and a university.  Students digitize objects from the museum collection and build an image database available on the Web.  The experience includes the use of video-conference technologies to enhance collaboration between the museum and the university.  Students communicate with the museum staff, work on images and database information simultaneously and share experiences immediately.  By linking the digital image laboratory and the African American Museum, students have every opportunity to learn from museum professionals as well as from university professors. <p>



The project is a model for training professionals in the creation, use and management of digital images and may serve as a model of collaboration between museums and universities.  In addition, the project assesses the impact resulting from improved access to a museum collection through the Web.<p>



The project is ongoing and scheduled to conclude in Fall of 2000.  Preliminary data reports and in-progress evaluations are available at the project Website, linked from <a href="http://www.unt.edu/slis">http://www.unt.edu/slis</a>.  In the Spring of 1999, a test database was made available and the project plan was piloted by students in a Digital Imaging Laboratory course offered at the School of Library and Information Sciences.  Comments and suggestions are encouraged and should be addressed to the author.  Special appreciation goes to the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services for the funds to make this project possible.<p>
