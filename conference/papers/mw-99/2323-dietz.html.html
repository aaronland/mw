<h3>Telling Stories: Procedural Authorship and

                    Extracting Meaning from Museum

                    Databases</h3>



<b><a href="../../bios/au_2787.html">Steve Dietz</a></b>, Walker Art Center, USA



<blockquote><i>The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the

Jacquard loom weaves flowers and trees. </i><br>

<p>

<i>You want to write a song but first you have to invent a piano.</i><br>

<h3>From the Library of Alexandria to the World Wide Web<br>

</h3>



<p>

It has been suggested that the pigeon holes for the vast collection

of papyrus scrolls at the library of Alexandria were a technical

innovation that greatly facilitated access to the library's holdings.

(Canfora, 1990) Ever since, cultural heritage institutions and

their collections management software vendors have been attempting

to wrestle under control the information they know about their

collections. Generally, however, museum automation systems, computer-based

and otherwise, have been as much for the management of resources

as access to them. It is only with the rise of the World Wide

Web that, arguably, a new emphasis on public access to museum

informational resources has arisen. Inevitably, as a field, we

have begun to succeed in providing the public access to much of

the information we as managers have spent the last 20 plus years

automating--that is, making &quot;machine readable.&quot; The

question is, in part, is this the information the public is looking

for and, in part, how can we make it compelling. <br>



<p>

In 1997, just as projects such as <a href="http://www.thinker.org/" target="_new">The Thinker</a> (http://www.thinker.org)

and the <a href="http://www.nga.gov/search/" target="_new">National Gallery of Art's</a> (Washington, DC) powerful Leonardo

system (http://www.nga.gov/search/) were coming online, at the

first Museums &amp; the Web conference, the panel &quot;Accessing

Museum Collections Over the Web&quot; (http://www.archimuse.com/mw97/mw97wed.htm#13)

was raising important questions about the value to the user of

all this effort. <br>



<p>

Not surprisingly, the Web, despite its inadequacies and the need

for museums to rethink their information practices, was seen as

critical to the success of providing access to museum information

integrated across knowledge domains, telling educational stories,

and creating dynamic and compelling interactive exhibitions.<br>



<p>

Jim Blackaby and Beth Sandore focused on &quot;practical approaches

to data organization and access,&quot; using work at the U.S.

Memorial Holocaust Museum and the Oregon Historical Society to

demonstrate how  &quot;you could put your fingers on all of the

information about a specific topic in a museum, regardless of

whether it was drawn from the objects collection, exhibit catalogues,

the library's holdings, or the prints and slides collection.&quot;

(<a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw97/speak/blackaby.htm" target="_new">http://www.archimuse.com/mw97/speak/blackaby.htm</a>)<br>



<p>

Kevin Donovan gave an impassioned plea  that &quot;Simply providing

the public with access to data is insufficient to satisfy the

goal of public education.&quot; Museums, at least in their databased,

public outreach efforts, need to kick the object-centered habit.



<blockquote><i>To achieve on-line Public Learning as I have described it museums

need to offer enriched, value-added content that supplements label

copy and object records with well-told stories that captivate

and enlighten. . . . museum information systems must evolve from

object-centric collection management systems to context capable

content management systems. </i>(<a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw97/speak/donovan.htm" target="_new">http://www.archimuse.com/mw97/speak/donovan.htm</a>)</blockquote>



Howard Besser treated us to a mini-history of museum information

systems and how they differed from interactive exhibition systems:



<blockquote><i>Historically, most museum automation efforts have been driven

by the need for record-keeping and inventory control, and have

resulted in collection management systems. A smaller set of automation

efforts has centered in museum education departments, and has

focused on interactive exhibits. The vendors, software, tools,

and platforms for computers used in collection management have

been very different from those in interactive exhibition. </i>(<a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw97/speak/besser.htm" target="_new">http://www.archimuse.com/mw97/speak/besser.htm</a>)</blockquote>



Today, as even a cursory scan of the 1999 Museums &amp; the Web

conference program (<a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw99/sessions/index.html" target="_new">http://www.archimuse.com/mw99/sessions/index.html</a>)

shows, there are countless remarkable efforts to yoke databased

museum information to web-based outreach programs. Are we there,

then? Can users put their fingers on all the information they

want? Are we telling stories that matter? Are we creating compelling,

interactive experiences?<br>



<p>

The answer is yes, there are some provocative models, and no,

it will be impossible to implement them on a universal scale as

they are currently constructed.<br>



<h3>From the Collection to the Library to the Archive: <br>

Integrated

Information Access<br>

</h3>



<p>

Arguably, we are furthest along in the arena of integrated information

access. A joint project between the Walker Art Center and The

Minneapolis Institute of Arts, <a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/" target="_new">ArtsConnectEd</a> (http://www.artsconnected.org)

is indicative of the direction and state of such efforts. <p>



<img src="images/sd_ace1.jpg" width="400" height="251" border="0" alt="ArtsConnectEd--WAC/MIA"><br><br>





<font size=-1><b>Figure 1:</b> A<a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/" target="_new">rtsConnectEd</a>, an integrated information access joint project

between the Walker Art Center and The Minneapolis Institute of

Arts, with a particular emphasis on use in the K-12 classroom

by teachers and students. (http://www.artsconnected.org)</font>

<p>

Contrary to Donovan's assertion that collection management systems

needed to become more comprehensive MIA and Walker separated information

management from access. We take periodic dumps of the information

in our various managements systems, &quot;scrub&quot; the data,

and put it into an Inquery database. This allows users to find

 information about a specific topic in either or both museums,

regardless of whether it was drawn from the objects collection,

exhibit catalogues, the library's holdings, or the archives.<br>



<p>

The system is quite powerful and includes over 100,000 collection,

library, and archive records from both institutions, more than

1,000 dynamically zoomable object images, hundreds of hours of

audio and video, numerous curriculum units, and interactive hypermedia

modules. Perhaps most usefully, any search provides related items

that the searcher may not have thought to ask for.<br><br>

<img src="images/sd_deluxe.jpg" width="346" height="345" border="0" alt="ArtsConnectEd--WAC/MIA"><br>

<br>



<font size=-1><b>Figure 2:</b> Search Deluxe allows users to specify the scope and type of search results. The results identify related items that

are not necessarily part of the initial search result set.</font>

<p>

While the search engine is only one part of ArtsConnectEd--there

are also extensive interfaces to synthetic classroom materials--after

three full days in the Dayton-Hudson usability lab at two different

stages of the project, we are forced to recognize that there is

strong corroboration that the information we are providing--i.e.

the information we have created over the past 20 years--is not

always what the user is looking for. As one participant who had

successfully completed one of the usability scenarios put it,

&quot;where's the information.&quot; He didn't recognize what

the museum collection database had to say about an object as something

of interest to him.<br>



<p>

Donovan succinctly states what many art museums in particular

do not like to admit: 



<blockquote><i>as any paleontologist who has walked into a gallery of Trecento

Italian paintings can tell you, or any art historian who has been

confronted with a display case filled with geological samples

knows, objects do not give up the richness of their history, context,

and meaning easily. Museums need to wrap layers of interpretation

around the bare fact of an object before the public can begin

to grasp its significance. The same holds true for the information

we offer on-line to our publics.<br>

</i></blockquote>



Simply providing users an object's creation date, creator name,

medium, and so on is not enough, even if the information has been

culled from different domains at different institutions. For many

users, we need to provide a richer environment, a more compelling

online experience.



<h3>From Categories to Stories<br>

</h3>



<p>

While object-centeredness may be good from a museum collection

point of view, Donovan argues that it is not the best way to engage

the public.



<blockquote><i>Instead of leading with the object, lead with the story of

the culture, historical context, important people and places,

and their importance. Tell engaging stories with objects woven

through them. Do so via entertaining, prescribed paths that both

lead the user lightly by the hand and encourage curiosity, exploration

and serendipity.<br>

</i></blockquote>

<p>

This approach of animating the museum experience and museum objects

with a narrative structured is echoed by the eminent information

architect and exhibition designer Ralph Appelbaum (1996), who

designed the magnificent installations for the American Museum

of Natural History and the U.S. Memorial Holocaust Museum: 



<blockquote><i>In our recent work for the American Museum of Natural History

and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, we have experimented

with ways to activate the total experience of communication goals.

We look for architectural and environmental metaphors for the

key pedagogical concepts behind an exhibition, so that space traditionally

left neutral is given voice. This approach casts a broader informational

net to engage the receptiveness of different visitors. We feel

the results are seen in people's sense of immersion, attention

span, and enhanced memory of their experience, provoking them

to discuss the exhibit with others and engage in activities such

as reading more on the subject, visiting related sites, or becoming

more involved with the museum.<br>

</i></blockquote>



As one example of an online story-context, Donovan cites the <a href="http://www.monticello.org/index. html" target="_new">Monticello

Web site</a> (http://www.monticello.org/index. html), which allows

the visitor to follow a day in the life of Thomas Jefferson. This

narrative may be particularly powerful because it replicates our

internal diurnal clock. The day-in-the-life narrative is, in fact,

fascinating and providing a quotidian context for the use of Jefferson's

writing desk probably does mean a lot more than most people than

the straight collection  database record that probably exists

for it. <br><br>

<img src="images/sd_jefferson.jpg" width="350" height="221" border="0" alt="Monticello"><br>

<br>



<font size=-1><b>Figure 3:</b> A day in the life of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello.

(<a href="http://www.monticello.org/Day/A_Day_in_the_Life.html" target="_new">http://www.monticello.org/Day/A_Day_in_the_Life.html</a></font>)

<p>

 Nevertheless, I do question how far one can actually explore

with just a pre-determined narrative, which remains largely textual

and which the visitor reads more than she participates in. Perhaps

more significantly, it presents, basically, a single point of

view. Presumably, Jefferson's slaves had a different idea of a

day at Monticello. As James J. O'Donnell (1998) writes:



<blockquote><i>The author is already an endangered species and rightly so.

The notion that authoritative discourse comes with a single monologic

voice thrives on the written artifact. Both oral discourse . .

. and the networked conversations that already surround us suggest

that in the dialogue of conflicting voices, a fuller representation

of the world may be found. The notion that reality itself can

be reduced to a single model universally shared is at best a useful

fiction, at worst a hallucination that will turn out to have been

dependent on the written word for its ubiquity and power<br>

</i></blockquote>

<p>

Museums rightly strive to present authoritative information, but

this need not be limited it to a single, authorless (institutional)

point of view. And while multi-vocality is not specific to digital

media--think of <i>Rashoman</i>---the ability to present parallel

and even conflicting narratives is an easy task. In the ArtsConnectEd

project, for example, both Walker and MIA have created multiple-narrative

presentations. In &quot;World Ceramics,&quot; you can choose the

point of view of an artist, an archaeologist, or a curator (<a href="http://www.artsmia.org/ceramics/secondary/" target="_new">http://www.artsmia.org/ceramics/secondary/</a>).

In &quot;<a href="http://www.walkerart.org/ace/tye/" target="_new">Through Your Eyes</a>&quot; (http://www.walkerart.org/ace/tye/),

you can &quot;tour&quot; the Walker's varied programs through

the particular experiences of different members of the local community.



<h3>From Multi-Vocal to Hyper-Linear<br>

</h3>



<p>

Arguably, it is more natural for humans to think in associative

webs rather than in strictly linear fashion. Until the advent

of the hyperlinking capability of the World Wide Web, however,

non-linear narrative was largely the province of experimental

literature and cinema. <br>



<p>

And whether one sees it as a vice or a virtue, museums increasingly

have to recognize that their future audience will have been brought

up on the jump cuts of MTV, the branching game worlds of Nintendo,

and the hyperlinking of the Web. In such an environment, hypertext

is a survival strategy.<br>



<p>

Artists remain the primary expanders of hypertext narratives.

A brief sampling might include Mark Amerika's <a href="http://www.grammatron.com/" target="_new">Grammatron</a> (http://www.grammatron.com/);

Olia Lialina's <a href="http://www.teleportacia.org/war/" target="_new">My Boyfriend Came Back from the War</a>  (http://www.teleportacia.org/war/);

Melinda Burgess's <a href="http://www.subtle.net/line/" target="_new">Line</a>  (http://www.subtle.net/line/);

Darcey Steinke's  <a href="http://adaweb.walkerart.org/project/blindspot/" target="_new">Blindspot</a>  (http://adaweb.walkerart.org/project/blindspot/);

Judy Malloy and Cathy Marshall's,  <a href="http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/~malloy/html/beginning.html" target="_new">Forward Anywhere<</a> (http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/~malloy/html/beginning.html);

and Claude Closky's <a href="http://www.diacenter.org/closky/index.html" target="_new">Do You Want Love or Lust? </a>(http://www.diacenter.org/closky/index.html).

<br>



<p>

 In &quot;<a href="http://www.grammatron.com/htc1.0/" target="_new">Hypertextual Consciousness,</a>&quot; Mark Amerika, one

of the best-known practitioners and theoreticians of hypertext

and hypermedia, posits hypertext as a kind of subversive experiential

space that also hints at auto-generation (&quot;Writing Machine&quot;).





<blockquote><i>Hypertext, as a concept, suggests an alternative to the more

rigid, authoritarian linearity of conventional book-contained

text. In the middle of reading or viewing a hypertext . . . the

reader/participant (co-conspirator) is given a number of options

to select from so as to break away from the text-block being presently

read, thus enabling the reader/participant to immediately enter

a new writing or textual space.. . . A hypertextual viewing style

would be one where the reader/participant (co-conspirator) actively

clicks their way into new writing or textual spaces . . . . Hypertext,

as a more narratologically-minded (fictionally-generated) clickual

reading/viewing style, could be construed as kind of Writing Machine.

<br>



<p>

In a not dissimilar vein, Mitchel Resnick, a professor in the

Epistemology and Learning Group at the MIT Media Lab is researching

the idea of &quot;active essays&quot; (<a href="http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/emergence/active-essay.html" target="_new">http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/<br>el/projects/emergence/active-essay.html</a>),

by which computers make possible a new form of narrative expression,

in which manipulable computational objects are integrated with

text, graphics, and video.<br><br>

<img src="images/sd_beuys.jpg" width="400" height="278" border="0" alt="Beuys/Logos"><br>

<br>



<font size=-1><b>Figure 6:</b> Julie Luckenbach and Louis Mazza, &quot;<a href="http://www.walkerart.org/beuys/hyper" target="_new">Beuys/Logos,</a>&quot;

Walker Art Center (http://www.walkerart.org/beuys/hyper).</font><br>



<p>

The Walker used the format of the hyperessay as its online &quot;catalog

essay,&quot; <a href="http://www.walkeart.org/beuys/hyper/" target="_new">Beuys/Logos</a> (http://www.walkeart.org/beuys/hyper/)

for an exhibition <i>Joseph Beuys Multiples.</i> Written by Julie

Luckenbach and designed by Louis Mazza, this approach allows the

reader to chose what interests her the most and follow that thread,

including beyond the essay, so to speak, to other resources on

the Internet that may have no formal relation to Beuys--certainly

not to this specific exhibition--at all.<br>



<p>

The &quot;traditional&quot; complaints about hypertext, of course,

are that it destabilizes our notion of narrative as being a specific

trajectory, it diminishes the authorial role, and it simply isn't

rewarding. The first two concerns, as the philosopher Wiilliam

J. Mitchell (992) suggests, are well founded:



<blockquote><i>So we must abandon the traditional conception of an art world

populated by stable, enduring, finished works and replace it with

one that recognizes continual mutation and proliferation of variants

- much as with oral epic poetry. Notions of individual authorial

responsibility for image content, authorial determination of meaning,

and authorial prestige are correspondingly diminished.<br>

</i></blockquote>



<h3>From Storytelling to Conversation<br>

</h3>





<blockquote><i>Socrates said that writing forces you to follow an argument

rather than participate in it. He hated the idea that someone

could write something down, and then go off and die, and you would

never be able to argue them back out of it. What we think is so

important about writing he thought was horrible.</i><br>



--<b>Alan Kay</b> (1998)</blockquote>



Kay's Socrates story points to an important difference between

storytelling and conversation. Storytelling, while certainly influenced

by audience responses, is one way, declamatory. A good conversation,

on the other hand, is two-way, equally influenced by both parties.

As Roger Schank (1994), director of Instructional Learning Systems

at Northwestern University, and developer of &quot;ASK&quot; puts

it:



<blockquote><i>ASK is a form of hypermedia based on the metaphor of having

a conversation with an expert (or a group of experts). In this

conversation, the user provides questions and the ASK system provides

the answers. In a real conversation, both participants influence

the flow of discussion. In an ASK system, the same holds true.

The user influences the flow by selecting which questions to pursue

and the ASK system influences the flow through the answers it.

(</i><a href="http://www.ils.nwu.edu/~e_for_e/nodes/NODE-358-pg.html" target="_new">http://www.ils.nwu.edu/<br>%7Ee_for_e/nodes/NODE-358-pg.html</a>)</blockquote>

<br>



<p>

Amerika's &quot;Writing Machine,&quot; Resnick's &quot;active

essays&quot; (a term coined by Alan Kay), Mitchell's decentered

author, Schank's conversations all point to an important and distinctive

characteristic of digital media. This characteristic is commonly

referred to as interactivity, although in this context a better

term might be computability, the basis for procedural authorship.

<br>



<h3>From Interactivity to Responsiveness<br>

</h3>



<p>

Besser, in his 1997 panel presentation, was making a distinction

between the software for museum information management and &quot;interactive

exhibitions.&quot; Exemplary examples of such an interactive exhibition

might be &quot;<a href="http://www.moma.org/onlineprojects/cumming/index.html" target="_new">Academic Interactive Exercise: Robert Cumming</a>&quot;

(http://www.moma.org/onlineprojects/cumming/index.html) or &quot;<a href="http://www.walkerart.org/education/aom/simpson/" target="_new">Artwork

of the Month: Lorna Simpson, <i>Wigs</i></a>&quot; (http://www.walkerart.org/education/aom/simpson/).

<br>



<p>

Both of these projects take advantage of the powerful capabilities

of digital media to create activity-based interactions based on

an original artwork. Neither, however, is interactive in the sense

that artist and media theoritician Simon Biggs argues for:



<blockquote><i>Both the term &quot;navigation&quot;, and the sense in which

it used, represents a narrowing of the possibilities for interactive

media. The idea of navigation is primarily founded on a very traditional

notion of what an artwork might be. Fundamentally, the use of

this word implies work which is more or less fixed in its content,

and through which the reader can &quot;navigate&quot; in a non-linear

fashion. This allows the emergent illusion that the reader is

experiencing a dynamic and interactive work.</i>





<i>Such work however is not interactive. . . .  An interactive

work is significantly different. . . . . The term interactivity

can be used to refer to those works which feature some form of

responsiveness to the reader, where that responsiveness causes

the content of the work to be altered.</i>

<p>

Biggs's own project,  <a href="http://www.easynet.co.uk/simonbiggs/greatwall1.htm" target="_new">The Great Wall of China </a> (http://www.easynet.co.uk/simonbiggs/greatwall1.htm)<i>,</i>

is a &quot;writing machine&quot; that is more like a musical than

written composition, and at first blush it may not seem very appropriate

for the serious world of vetted museum information. It is important

to keep in mind, however, that the apparently random texts are

responding to user input--in this case the movements of the mouse.

<br>



<p>

One of the perennial problems with very large databases, like

The Thinker or as we hope AMICO (<a href="http://www.amico.net/" target="_new">http://www.AMICO.net/</a>) will become,

is that of browsing. How do you give a sense of the scope of the

collection in a way that allows for serendipity? The traditional

answer is a random slide show that has some kind of filtering

mechanisms. What if, however, there was some other kind of responsiveness

(two-way) that did not rely on either fixed categorization that

the user may or may not be familiar with or completely random

display. It is easy to imagine such navigation as being both valuable

and entertaining.<br>

<h3>From the Author to Procedural Authorship<br>

</h3>



<p>

It is arguable that all artworks are interactive. Lev Manovich

(1998), for instance, argues that:



<blockquote><i>New media takes &quot;interaction&quot; literally, equating

it with  a strictly physical interaction between a user and a

screen (by pressing a button), at the sake of psychological interaction.

The psychological process of filling in, hypothesis forming, recall

and identification--which are required for us to comprehend any

text or image at all--are erroneously equated with an objectively

existing structure of interactive links.<br>

</i></blockquote>



Procedural authorship, however, moves the author's traditional

role over, so to speak, and without the reader/interactor, there

is nothing authored except possibility. Simply put, procedural

authorship makes the rules, which the reader en(inter)acts. <br>



<p>

One simple way to explain this idea is with Ken Perlin's Wide

World Web. (http://mrl.nyu.edu/perlin/demox/Planet.html) This

java applet produces an earth-like rendering. Every time it is

launched, the world is a bit different, but from Perlin's point

of view, every time, it's exactly what he intended. The authorship

is under the hood, so to speak, in the algorithm. The &quot;story&quot;

he has authored--a dynamic world--varies within appropriate parameters,

which he has determined.<br><br>



Another example of procedural authorship is baseball. Baseball

is defined by both a set space and a set of rules. Every game,

hundreds of thousands of them each year, is the same--set of rules.

Yet every game is different. Each game has its own personality,

based on the interactions of the players. And while some might

call the game dull, for others it is a thrilling drama, precisely

because the outcome is never known and different every time.



<h3>From Responsive Interactivity to Interactive Narrative<br>

</h3>



<p>

To return to Manovich, not every responsive program is a narrative.

<br>



<p>

<blockquote><i>To qualify as a narrative, a cultural object has to satisfy

a number of criteria, which literary scholar Mieke Bal defines

as follows: it should contain both an actor and a narrator; it

should also consist of three distinct levels consisting of the

text, the story, and the fabula; and its &quot;contents&quot;

should be a &quot;series of connected events caused or experienced

by actors. Obviously not all cultural objects are narratives.

However, in the world of new media, the word &quot;narrative&quot;

is often used as an all-inclusive term, to cover up the fact that

we have not yet developed a language to describe these new strange

objects. . . . Thus, a number of database records linked together

so that more than one trajectory is possible, is assumed to constitute

&quot;interactive narrative.&quot; But to just create these trajectories

is of course not sufficient; the author also has to control the

semantics of the elements and the logic of their connection so

that the resulting object will meet the criteria of narrative

as outlined above.<br>

</i></blockquote>

<p>

Hence, Paul Vanouse's <i>Persistent Data Confidante, </i>while

an excellent example of procedural authorship--based on viewer

ratings, secrets in the database can either die off or mate with

other secrets and create new hybrid ones--is not a narrative,

while his <i>Consensual Fantasy Engine </i> is an exemplary narrative

whose trajectory is entirely determined by audience responses

to a series of questions and the corresponding responses of a

number of algorithmic &quot;critics,&quot; which stitch together

a narrative on the fly.<br><br>

<img src="images/sd_cfe.jpg" width="400" height="253" border="0" alt="Consensual Fantasy Engine"><br>

<br>

Engine,</a> screenshot. (http://www.walkerart.org/gallery9/vanouse/)</font>

<br><br>



Just because a procedurally authored projects meets the criteria

for being a narrative doesn't mean that it is good, of course.

Walter Ong (1982), however, has suggested that In the 1930s, scholars

concluded that Homer, one of the greatest storytellers of the

Western canon, probably used stock phrases according to context,

using a simple replacement strategy. And it is such a strategy

that Janet Murray, in her excellent book <i>Hamlet On the Holodeck</i>

 (1997), concludes Vladamir Propp validated.



<blockquote><i>When he finished all the extant titles, Propp was able to summarize

all the variants of the Russian folktale in one inclusive representation.

His work suggests that satisfying stories can be generated by

substituting and rearranging formulaic units according to rules

as precise as a mathematical formula.</i></blockquote>



<h3>From Interactive Narrative to <br>

Machine-to-Machine Understanding

<br>

</h3>



<p>

Beyond an interest in experimenting with innovative presentation

methods, the other reason new ways of creating stories becomes

so important potentially, is hinted at in a talk by Cliff Lynch

back at the 1997 Museums &amp; the Web conference. In a session

on &quot;Dublin Core and Warwick Framework Metadata for the Description

and Location of Networked Information Objects&quot; <a href="(http_/www.archimuse.com/mw97/mw97tues.htm#10" target="_new">(http://www.archimuse.com/mw97/mw97tues.htm#10</a>),

Lynch, the current executive director of the Coalition for Networked

Information, suggested that one of the dominant issues facing

institutions such as museums and libraries is the geometrically

cascading explosion of information bytes, the majority of which

will never be able to be processed by humans directly. We must

figure out systems for machine-to-machine processing <u>and comprehension</u>

of information. <br>



<p>

Lynch was referring primarily to enabling search and retrieve

functions, but the need can apply equally to creating rich information

contexts, narrative stories, and responsive interactivity about

and around the objects in museum collections. We are beginning

to understand how to do this well in one-off situations, but it

is truly a Sissyphean task and for every 6-month or year-long

project completed, there are hundreds more waiting in the archives

and dozens more possibilities being acquired on a daily basis.

We will never catch up with the flow of facts to hand-knead them

into coherent information environments that open up the possibility

of increased knowledge by the user without additional tools.<br>



<p>

Joseph Squier's new project, <a href="http://gertrude.art.uiuc.edu/ludgate/the/place/place2.html" target="_new">io</a> (http://gertrude.art.uiuc.edu/ludgate/the/place/place2.html),

 uses an interactive engine to allow user input of a limited vocabulary

to have a primitive kind of conversation and related dynamic &quot;illustrations&quot;--or

vice-versa. Again, it is not hard to imagine using a similar function

to understand better what people are looking for and translating

it to the way that museums manage their information--a gap that

can be very large and at times insurmountable.<br><br>

<br>



<p>

Richard Rinehart's new project, <a href="http://www.coyoteyip.com/" target="_new">An Experience Base-A Boolean

Typhoon</a> (http://www.coyoteyip.com), is interesting for the

way that it flexibly structures user input to create a self-generating

database using data-multipurposing-friendly meta-language for

describing life, an emerging proto-standard, which Rinehart has

registered with the ANSI and ISO  standards organizations, and

this experience base is the first testbed project exploring the

feasibility of such a language.<br><br>

Ken Goldberg et al's <a href="http://shadow.ieor.berkeley.edu/humor/" target="_new">Jester: The On-Line Joke Recommender </a> (http://shadow.ieor.berkeley.edu/humor/)<b> </b>is a collaborative

filtering project that asks you to rate a series of jokes and

then, based on your ratings, it recommends jokes &quot;personalized&quot;

for your sense of humor. This kind of process, collaborative filtering,

has proved successful in databases of movies, books, music, and

other matters of &quot;taste.&quot; It is a project/process waiting

to happen at museums.<br><br>
