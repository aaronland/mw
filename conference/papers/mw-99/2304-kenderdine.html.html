    <h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>

    <p>In Munich, the guiding principle [of the kunstkammer] was to strive against a mere

    conglomeration of objects and create instead a sumptuous display of the heterogeneous and

    wide ranging contents (Seelig, 1985, p. 81).</p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>In this house you can circulate everywhere as there are no separating walls (The report

      of Bohemian traveler Friedrish von Dohna 1592-3 reflecting on the kunstkammer, quoted in

      Seelig, 1985, p. 81).</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>The descriptions for the early 16<sup>th</sup>/17<sup>th</sup>-century

    &#145;wunderkammer&#146; (&#145;wonder cabinet&#146;) and &#145;kunstkammer&#146; mirror

    with precision some elements in the current rhetoric of cyberspace. In the creation (or

    recreation) of cross-disciplinary heterogeneous museums resources, through the

    developments of on-line information meta-centers*<a name="metacenter4"></a>, the

    principles and philosophies of the wunderkammer are again invoked. This paper discusses

    the Australian Museums On-Line (AMOL) web site (<a href="http://amol.org.au/"

    target="_blank">http://amol.org.au/</a>) as both a museum information meta-center and a

    &#145;wunderkammer&#146;. </p>

    <p>In a three-part document this paper spans issues in museology, design theory,

    information architecture and web production. Part 1 will briefly review the history in the

    developments of museum meta-centers, and the genesis of the distributed model for access

    to heterogeneous information bases. </p>

    <p>Part 2 of the discussion will introduce the history and mission of the AMOL web site

    and describe the resources it gives access to. Discussion includes the real-time

    communities and museums that are part of the network flourishing across the country.</p>

    <p>Part 3 of the paper will focus on the design processes and the ability of electronic

    systems to &#145;morph&#146; in response to both internal and external stimulus. I will

    introduce the principles of pragmatic design as foundations for examining processes of

    expansion, revision and re-design of the AMOL web site. </p>

    <p>In March 1998 the AMOL contract was re-let to new developers (the current AMOL

    Coordination Unit). By charting the transition of the web through this relocation I will

    examine some of the problems specific to inherited architecture. The web site employs a

    metaphor, the &#145;wunderkammer&#146;, to give a matrix for the divergent resources

    contained in this meta-center.</p>

    <p>By way of conclusion the new projects on the AMOL network will be described. These

    initiatives witness the evolution of the web site in response to its bureaucratic,

    conceptual, and architectural structures. The projects include: <ul>

      <li>the CIMI meta data test-bed; </li>

      <li>a cross disciplinary peer reviewed journal produced in partnership with a university; </li>

      <li>the extension of the core data to include more complete knowledge in an intelligent

        system; and </li>

      <li>a demonstration of how the internet can give witness to curatorial process and

        collections in the making. </li>

    </ul>

    <p><a name="metacenter3"></a><small>*Meta-center: term used by the Canadian Heritage

    Information Network to describe integrated state of the accessible or available

    information. It is not a centralized collection of information but a series of

    relationships established among multiple information resources (Neimanis and Geber, 1998).

    <h3><a name="part1"></a>Part 1<br>

    <a name="genesis"></a>Genesis of the meta-center</h3>

    <p>A number of studies have examined some of the different approaches taken by cultural

    organizations to the design of web museums. These range from web sites replicating aspects

    of the contemporary museum and exhibitions in a virtual mirror (&#145;brochure

    ware&#146;), through to dynamic inter-organizational collaborations, and those between

    organizations and individual users (for example McKenzie, 1997; Piacente, 1996, Mouseion

    project, 1997).</p>

    <p>Most museum web sites have a number of objectives. They offer the services of a shop,

    information such as the opening hours and contacts for staff members. However, museums in

    the networked environment have continued to act as 'stand alone' entities reflecting their

    status as centers of exclusivity. Zorich notes: &quot;As more and more individuals and

    organizations become information providers on telecommunications networks, the power of

    any single site risks diminution&quot; (1997: p. 176).</p>

    <p>Also, the increasing concerns expressed over authenticity, visibility and authority of

    museum resources in this environment of stand-alone models where they compete with other

    forms of entertainment and media (for example Bearman and Trant, 1998, <a

    href="http://sunsite.anu.edu.au/mirrors/dlib/dlib/june98/06bearman.html" target="_blank">http://sunsite.anu.edu.au/mirrors/dlib/dlib/june98/06bearman.html</a>).</p>

    <p>From the debates that started with MacDonald and Alsford (1989) to more recently

    include Stam (1993) and Teather (1998), we can see how the theoretical basis of New

    Museology supports the integration of museum information resources in an electronic

    environment. As Stam notes, New Museology seeks to use the museum information base, which

    is: &quot;the full complex of data supporting institutional activities ranging from the

    pragmatics of acquisition to the abstraction of interpretive display&quot; (cited in

    Teather, 1998, p. 6). </p>

    <p>The producers of the Mouseion project (1997) have defined the &#145;networked

    museum&#146; to be a constellation of hypermedia that: <ul>

      <li>is derived from the works and objects in a museum;</li>

      <li>is specific to themes referring to works and objects conserved in museums;</li>

      <li>is reflective of the disciplines associated with work in museums;</li>

      <li>includes forums, lists of museological and museographic matters, or themes connected to

        the area of research of any museum;</li>

      <li>provides general information about hours and services; and</li>

      <li>includes services on offer such as the sale of publications (The Mouseion project, 1997,

        <a href="http://nerve.itim.mi.cnr.it/mouseion/home.html" target="_blank">http://nerve.itim.mi.cnr.it/mouseion/home.html</a>).</li>

    </ul>

    <p>The networked museum is then: &quot;...not an imitation, much less a substitute for a

    real museum. It is a specific information object, with its own identity within the

    network...&quot; (id.).</p>

    <p>The increasing concerns of museum resources visibility and authority on the internet,

    together with New Museology and the dynamics offered by the internet for networking,

    contribute to an environment that supports the establishment of multiple institutions

    working together.</p>

    <p>This opportunity for collaboration is reflected by the growing number of initiatives

    around the world that seeks to integrate cultural information resources for the benefit of

    the museum community, the public and researchers. These are the networked museums.</p>

    <p>Most countries now offer gateways to listings of their museums and cultural resources.

    Some of these projects also seek to give access to the distributed digital resources

    contained in many museums. These sites are the foundations of the open intuitive systems

    of the information meta-centers as described by Neimanis and Geber (1998):</p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>Theoretically, an information Meta-Center is the integrated state of the accessible or

      available information. It is not a centralized collection of information but a series of

      relationships established among multiple information resources. It involves managing the

      process of communication or relationships among the components and constantly re-building

      the network of connections. It is intimately linked to a group of resources, in close and

      continuous communication, and it classifies the similarities and differences among them.

      Thus, through a cumulative process of experience, the Meta-Center has the potential to

      build up a more complete knowledge of the information environment, acting as a specialized

      gateway or access agent (Neimanis and Geber, 1998, p. 4).</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><a href="#toc"><small>[table of contents]</small></a></p>

    <h3><a name="themeta"></a>@ the meta-center</h3>

    <p>Australian Museums On-Line is one such web site of integrated information resources and

    parallels a number of other major government initiatives, most closely the Canadian

    Heritage Information Network (CHIN, <a href="http://www.chin.gc.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.chin.gc.ca/</a>)

    and the Arts and Humanities Data Service (<a href="http://ahds.ac.uk/index.html"

    target="_blank">http://ahds.ac.uk/index.html</a>).</p>

    <p>The aforementioned are webs that integrate heterogeneous data sets. They can be

    distinguished from other networked initiatives to digitize museum resources for

    redistribution that use disciplinary based data (e.g. art museums and image libraries and

    libraries per se). These other networks include for example: Getty Information Institute (<a

    href="http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/www.gii.getty.edu/" target="_blank">http://www.gii.getty.edu/</a>);

    the Museum Educational Site Licensing project (<a

    href="http://www.gii.getty.edu/index/mesl.html" target="_blank">http://www.gii.getty.edu/index/mesl.html</a>);

    the American Museums Network (<a href="http://www.amn.org/" target="_blank">http://www.amn.org/</a>);

    and the Art Museum Image Consortium (<a href="http://www.amico.net/" target="_blank">http://www.AMICO.net/</a>)

    incorporating its site licensing initiatives, to name just a few. </p>

    <p>All gateways to the distributed information and data stored at multiple museums and

    repositories face particular challenges that include: <ul>

      <li>aggregating a critical mass of digitized information; </li>

      <li>developing and implementing standards for the exchange of museum information and</li>

      <li>understanding the audiences for museum information (Zorich, 1997, pp. 182-188).</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Blackaby (1997, pp. 203-229) also notes that in addition to technical difficulties

    (hardware, software and data standards) for the integration of information resources,

    bureaucratic structures and inter-institutional relationships also present potential

    blocks in the &#145;free flow&#146; of information.</p>

    <p>In addition I observe that:</p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>information and communication may appear to be freely flowing around the world,

      unimpeded by borders and boundaries, in reality this is a highly controlled activity,

      designed to promote not a global village, as McLuhan and others so romantically put

      thought, but global marketplaces, where information as a commodity is brought and sold for

      profit (Birch, 1998: p.95).</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>However, non-profit support organizations and education-based initiatives have been

    established to help integrate networks of cultural material. They include: <ul>

      <li>the Museum Computer Network (MCN, <a href="http://world.std.com/~mcn/index.html"

        target="_blank">http://world.std.com/~mcn/index.html</a>);</li>

      <li>the International Council of Museums and the International Committee for Documentation

        of the International Council of Museums, (ICOM/CIDOC, <a href="http://www.cidoc.icom.org/"

        target="_blank">http://www.cidoc.icom.org/</a>); </li>

      <li>the Consortium for the Computer Interchange of Information (CIMI, <a

        href="http://www.cimi.org/" target="_blank">http://www.cimi.org/</a>), and </li>

      <li>a host of projects related to the implementation of metadata such as the Dublin Core (<a

        href="http://purl.oclc.org/dc/" target="_blank">http://purl.oclc.org/dc/</a>) and projects

        incorporating protocols such as Z39.5 and other standards (for example, CIMI projects at <a

        href="http://www.cimi.org/projects/index.html" target="_top">http://www.cimi.org/projects/index.html</a>).</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Within the research and development of integration techniques cultural organizations

    are increasingly moving from pre-organized information to a more open approach. At the

    Museums and the Web Conference 1998 (<a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw98"

    target="_blank">http://www.archimuse.com/mw98</a>) we heard details for a transition in

    CHIN &#145;architecture&#146; and &#145;behavior&#146; from a central resource to an

    information meta-center. </p>

    <p>In the CHIN analysis, user access is affected by the 'context', 'behavior', and

    'architecture' of the information. &#145;Context&#146; refers to the environment in which

    cognitive activities occur through the integration of contextual material;

    &#145;behavior&#146; to the dialogue between the users and the knowledge environment,

    while &#145;architecture&#146;: &quot;is the reflection of the knowledge domain, mirrored

    by the arrangement of the components to form patterns different from that could occur by

    chance&quot; (Neimanis and Geber, 1998, p. 4). </p>

    <p>CHIN has subsequently developed an intellectual access tool called the Integrator (for

    example see Artefacts Canada, <a

    href="http://daryl.chin.gc.ca/Artefacts/e_MasterLayout.cgi" target="_blank">http://daryl.chin.gc.ca/Artefacts/e_MasterLayout.cgi</a>)

    for the production of knowledge artifacts (ibid. p. 6) addressing the needs of users faced

    with a large number of returns in a search across multiple databases. They have also

    implemented search assistants such as thesauri and vocabularies (for example Getty&#146;s

    Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, <a href="http://www.gii.getty.edu/vocabulary/index.html"

    target="_blank">http://www.gii.getty.edu/vocabulary/index.html</a>).</p>

    <p>Also, recent developments in different search scenarios (such as image database that

    can be queried along colour or content descriptions and associations) can provide

    maturation of functionality for meta-center projects. Research following on from these

    projects is also vital to their evolution (for a critique of image based search methods

    see Schietse, 1998).</p>

    <p>With these encompassing views of the difficulties and possibilities of the meta-center,

    the paper will now focus more closely on the development of the AMOL web site. While the

    importance of systems integration and data standards are recognized, the continuing

    discussion will concentrate on the design processes and the stimulus for change in the

    information architecture. It will reflect on these processes of design and web site

    evolution as expressed through the principles of cybernetics, and will draw on the

    relationships to &#145;pragmatic design&#146; for computer based works. <a href="#toc"><small>[table

    <h3><a name="part2"></a>Part 2<br>

    <a name="facts"></a>Facts</h3>

    <p>The goal of the AMOL project is to dramatically increase access to the cultural

    resources of Australian museums via the internet, and to provide research and

    communication tools for people both inside and outside the museum communities. It involves

    over 70% of museums in this country. </p>

    <p>First initiated in 1993, the concept was seeded from the Working Group of the Cultural

    Ministers Council's Heritage Collections, producing the first comprehensive national

    strategy for the management of Australia's heritage collections. Through the activities of

    this Group (now the Heritage Collections Committee) and their Online Working Party, the

    web site pilots and site prototype were designed at the National Museum of Australia

    between 1995 and 1997. In 1998 the web site was put out to tender and currently resides in

    Sydney at the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. Funding for the project is provided by

    the museum community through the Heritage Collections Council and Federal Department of

    Communication, Information Technology and the Arts (<a href="http://www.dca.gov.au/"

    target="_blank">http://www.dca.gov.au/</a>). AMOL is also a major participant of

    Australia's Cultural Network (<a href="http://www.acn.net.au/" target="_blank">http://www.acn.net.au/</a>),

    the gateway to information about Australian cultural institutions and their programs.</p>

    <p>Through the AMOL project the museums and galleries of Australia are invited to provide

    information for a national directory, and to contribute information and images of their

    five most significant items to a directory database. In addition, item level records of

    objects from museum collections management systems may be included in the AMOL database.

    The data may be stored on the AMOL server directly, may reside on local servers (and

    remote indexed), and/or become part of the regional server network which act as host

    platforms for smaller museums. AMOL specifies a minimum core data set for the description

    of the objects to allow for the distributed searching. </p>

    <p>One of the primary political agendas driving AMOL is to ensure that smaller, regional

    and specialist museums participate as equal partners alongside higher profile, larger

    organizations. This arises out of the recognition that they hold collections of national

    significance but require support in their care of their collection (Hallet et al., 1998,

    p. 4). The widespread involvement of regional and smaller museums has recently prompted

    collection management software vendors to include an additional function that exports a

    subset of the collections data to the AMOL standard fields (for example <i>Collections</i>

    <i>Mosaic</i>, Western Australia; and proposed for inclusion in <i>Inmagic, </i>Queensland

    http://amol.org.au/craft/regional_mus/software.asp).</p>

    <p>Since its inception, the information resources available on the AMOL web site have

    grown to include: <ul>

      <li>a national directory of over 1000 museums searchable in different categories (<a

        href="http://amol.org.au/guide/guide_index.asp" target="_blank">http://amol.org.au/guide/guide_index.asp</a>);</li>

      <li>a searchable collections database comprising 356,000 artifacts records from over 36

        museums soon to expand to 500,000 records from 50 museums (<a

        href="http://amol.org.au/collection/collection_index.asp" target="_blank">http://amol.org.au/collection/collection_index.asp</a>);</li>

      <li>a regional server network incorporating Western Australian Museum (<a

        href="http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/" target="_blank">http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/</a>); the

        Museum of Victorian (<a href="http://www.mov.vic.gov.au/" target="_blank">http://www.mov.vic.gov.au/</a>);

    <h3><a name="realtime"></a>Real time community</h3>

    <blockquote>

      <p>&quot;In virtual communities...space becomes a metaphor and emotions become icons&quot;

      (Digital Thinking, 1998, <a href="http://www.feedmag.com/95.08dialog/95.08dialog1.html"

      target="_blank">http://www.feedmag.com/95.08dialog/95.08dialog1.html</a>)</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>I note the recent philosophical debates CHIN has had in re-envisaging the access to its

    information base where &quot;the maker, the user, the artefact, technology and intuition

    have gradually been united in a participatory creative process or &#145;global

    consciousness&#146;&quot;(Neimanis and Geber, 1998, p. 3).</p>

    <p>The AMOL web site is predominantly made up of members from the regional Australian

    museum community. It is these groups as opposed to larger institutions that have most

    enthusiastically embraced the opportunity to become part of the project even when they

    have limited information and technological infrastructure. We believe that this is partly

    due to the reduced levels of bureaucracy that these smaller organizations have, and a more

    relaxed approach to the ownership of information and copyright issues. By embracing the

    internet the regional museums of isolated rural Australia are able to renegotiate

    distance. They now have the opportunity for a low cost interpretive program.</p>

    <p>What also appears most significantly in the documentation of AMOL, (in the letters from

    the regional museums to the coordination unit, and in meetings with a large number of

    regional museums), is the forum that AMOL offers is as much about an on-line virtual

    community as about the real time connections it has stimulated. The AMOL Coordination Unit

    is increasingly involved in workshops, seminars and coordinating regional museum

    collaborations.</p>

    <p>I note: &quot;Through combining material and expertise that resides at different

    locations virtual museums allow for building a community among individuals who have not

    found a common meeting ground with others in a physical place (Marcum, 1996, p. 204).</p>

    <p>As Mitchell (1998) points out we are inaccurate to think that virtual communities and

    real networks are mutually exclusive. He says:</p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>this question [of virtual community] seems to suggest that we must choose between

      participating in place-based communities and joining electronically supported, virtual

      ones -- that it's one or the other. But that's just not the case. It's more accurate to

      say that oddly presence and telepresence now play differing and potentially complimentary

      roles in sustaining the connections that matter to us. (Mitchell, 1998, <a

      href="http://www.feedmag.com/95.08dialog/95.08dialog1.html" target="_blank">http://www.feedmag.com/95.08dialog/95.08dialog1.html</a>).</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>In this sense we see how AMOL supports Teather&#146;s view that the web </p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>may actually be able to posit that the museum is a dynamic, complex and variable human

      endeavor, an entity which has shown over time adaptive qualities as it transforms to new

      societal developments&#133; (Teather, 1998, p. 7). </p>

    <h3><a name="part3"></a>Part 3<br>

    <a name="process"></a>Process of morphogenesis</h3>

    <p>As Van Alystene outlined at the closing plenary session at Museums and the Web 1998,

    cybernetics has applications not only to the patterns and signals of the web itself but

    also the system of social and professional communications that create and sustain the site

    as an enterprise.</p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>From the perspective of second order cybernetics, the web site, along with the agents

      that go into sustaining it, is a complex adaptive system, and in this regard may be

      considered a living organism. The key concept is the emergence of new forms through the

      result of positive feedback, in which forces that cause desired deviations are amplified

      (Van Alstyne, 1998).</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Further, as described in the web dictionary of cybernetics and systems, a morphogenic

    system is &quot;capable of maintaining its continuity and integrity by changing essential

    aspects of its structure or organizations&quot; (Cybernetics Dictionary, 1998, <a

    href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/Morphogenes.html" target="_blank">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASC/Morphogenes.html</a>).

    <h3><a name="pragmatic"></a>Pragmatic design</h3>

    <p>Coyne explores models for conservative, pragmatic, critical and radical design.

    &#145;Conservative design&#146; he considers &quot;an intervention or manipulation&#133;

    that presupposes our ability to declare our needs&quot; (Coyne, 1995,. p. 10). In this

    environment technological artifacts conserve the meanings and intentions of their

    creators. It is method-centered and proceeds from an undesirable situation to a desirable

    one. We can see how this design process is inherently inflexible in terms of the

    responding to the principles of cybernetics.</p>

    <p>The dynamics of cybernetics is most closely aligned to the &#145;pragmatic&#146; design

    process where pragmatism is concerned with &quot;the primacy of human action, the

    practicalities of human involvement, the materiality of the world, the interaction of the

    senses, and the formative power of technology&quot; (ibid., p. 17).</p>

    <p>&#145;Pragmatic design&#146; is considered &quot;not so much as addressing needs as

    projecting expectations. These expectations have less to do with individual genius than

    with community&quot; (ibid. p. 11). Within this framework, notions of the individual are

    replaced by considerations of authority, legitimacy, responsibility and the interweaving

    of roles, practices and technologies. Most importantly to the intent of this paper is

    Coyne&#146;s thesis that pragmatic design is: &quot;a kind of reflection in action&#146;-

    needs are commonly identified in retrospect or during the development of the design rather

    than at the outset of the design process. Design is an exploration&#133;.&quot; (ibid., p.

    11). </p>

    <p>When considering AMOL and other museum information gateways each reflect elements of

    the &#145;critical&#146; theme in their design. Coyne defines &#145;critical design&#146;

    as a political activity where the design itself is subject of critical scrutiny. He uses

    the example of architecture, urban design and planning where users (of new urban

    developments for instance) are helped to &quot;formulate and realize their own

    expectations&quot;. While recognizing community, there is the overall control of a few who

    use mission statements couched in vogue rhetoric. We are all familiar with these

    statements which herald the universality of computer and communications systems for

    grassroots entitlement.</p>

    <p>&#145;Radical design&#146; centers on the principles of deconstruction and &quot;is

    subversive of entrenched structures, assumptions and oppositions&quot; (ibid. p.10). We

    can see expressions of this in the earlier theoretical dialogues that spoke of usurping

    traditional power structures within museums through the transformative power of the

    internet, and the renegotiations of museum spaces and the authority of the object (for

    example see Witcomb, 1996; Kenderdine, 1996,1997). </p>

    <p>As Witcomb goes on to note however:</p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>postmodern perspectives on museums tend to forget the long history that media has had

      to play in the democratization of cultural production. Internet activity and the

      introduction of electronic medium to museums per se are not new in the attempts to break

      down hierarchical structures (Witcomb 1998, p. 23)<small>.</small></p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><a href="#toc"><small>[table of contents]</small></a></p>

    <h3><a name="rationalist"></a>Rationalist vs. Pragmatic</h3>

    <p>Coyne offers a rigorous analysis of the design of information technology in the

    postmodern age. He maintains that whereas rationalist design gives privilege to theory

    over practice, pragmatic design theory is woven into the practice itself (op cit. p. 17).

    Pragmatic design avoids a hierarchical view of knowledge whereby the practical always has

    the involvement of the community. Coyne acknowledges the philosophy of John Dewey

    (1859-1952), Marshall McLuchan (1911-1980) and Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) as fundamental

    to the use of pragmatism. The current wave of popular and accessible computing is largely

    of a pragmatic orientation.</p>

    <p>With these background thoughts I examine the thrust of the AMOL re-design process as it

    forms the foundation for the everyday flux of large-scale web sites. <br>

    <a href="#toc"><small>[table of contents]</small></a></p>

    <h3><a name="inherited"></a>Inherited architecture</h3>

    <p>The current AMOL Coordination Unit inherited the web site in March 1998 from the

    National Museum of Australia. As new caretakers of the web site we encountered a host of

    difficulties in the inherited legacy of code. These points listed below are not criticisms

    of the work by previous contractors but an acknowledgement of piecemeal developments and

    evolving policies that make up the earlier history of AMOL.</p>

    <p>The principles problems stemmed from the: <ul>

      <li>piece-meal work by multiple developers which resulted in an incoherent/illogical

        information architecture;</li>

      <li>scant documentation and absence of original data sets from regional museums database;</li>

      <li>inherited proprietary software which continued to require funds for servicing while the

        project was requiring different solutions;</li>

      <li>a database designed with a maximum number of possible entries;</li>

      <li>use of non-compliant dates;</li>

      <li>inherited server (UNIX) conflicted with the rest of the data sets stored in a Windows

        environment;</li>

      <li>code itself that contained so many patches that any alterations could start an avalanche

        of other code conflicts; and,</li>

      <li>the core data set for AMOL contains five fields. It has been increasingly recognized

        that the provision of this subset of museum information was devoid of context and meaning.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Within the framework of the contract were stipulations to re-design the interface, and

    to implement a series of new projects. This gave an opportunity to revise the information

    and system architecture and to improve navigation and functionality of the web site. The

    following discussion focuses on the information architecture, interface and navigation,

    and the development of new projects within the AMOL network. The importance of technical

    issues within the complex system architecture warrants in-depth analysis and discussion

    not possible here. I refer you to Hofmann and Miller (1999, <a

    href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw99/abstracts/prg_1128.html">http://www.archimuse.com/mw99/abstracts/prg_1128.html</a>)

    in respect of metadata and AMOL&#145;s involvement in the CIMI metadata test-bed as a good

    introduction to some of the issues involved in connectivity across distributed server

    environments. <a href="#toc"><small>[table of contents]</small></a></p>

    <small>Figure 1: AMOL home page</small></p>

    <p>Prior to the re-design, analysis of AMOL showed the existence of multiple user groups

    with distinct needs and orientations. It was decided to break the pre-1998 AMOL web site

    into three streams<a name="figreturn"></a> (<a href="#figures">Figure 1</a>): <ul>

      <li>for museum professionals as Museum Craft (<a

        href="http://amol.org.au/craft/craft_index.asp" target="_blank">http://amol.org.au/craft/craft_index.asp</a>)</li>

      <li>the Guide to Museums for community users (<a

        href="http://amol.org.au/guide/guide_one.asp" target="_blank">http://amol.org.au/guide/guide_one.asp</a>)

        and;</li>

      <li>Open Collections for research and databases (<a

        href="http://amol.org.au/collection/collection_index.asp" target="_blank">http://amol.org.au/collection/collection_index.asp</a>).

      </li>

    </ul>

    <p>To view the information architecture please refer to the AMOL web site (<a

    href="http://amol.org.au/about_amol/design/amolflow.htm" target="_blank">http://amol.org.au/about_amol/design/amolflow.htm</a>).</p>

    <p>The new design was finalized with relevant content being taken from the old site and

    reworked for the new web site. The remaining material was archived and made available on

    the new site. </p>

    <p>Each step of the design process was previewed before museum audiences throughout

    Australia, and with the input from the Heritage Collections Council&#146;s On-line Working

    Party (made up from senior museum bureaucrats and advisors). Difficulties appeared where

    political agendas threatened to impinge on the navigation of the web site itself, and

    where personal aesthetics intruded on clear thinking about information architecture. It is

    a difficult but interesting client/developer relationship that negotiates a range of

    viewpoints throughout the Australian museum community through its design. <a href="#toc"><small>[table

    of contents]</small></a></p>

    <h3><a name="metaphor"></a>Method and metaphor: the wonder cabinet</h3>

    <p>There are many debates in the computer interface design over the appropriate use and

    application of design metaphors. I support the use of metaphors as familiar access points

    to information matrixes. They can promote and enhance interpretation and navigation of the

    web site itself. Rather than advocating trivial trashcans and blinking folders, I am more

    interested in the holistic design metaphor. As Aristotle noted: &quot;the discourse must

    be made to sound exotic; for men are admirers of what is distant, and what is admired is

    pleasant&quot; (quoted in Coyne, 1995, p. 254).</p>

    <p>Coyne demonstrates that commentators frequently appeal to some new metaphor to promote

    the ideas of computers. &quot;Laurel promotes the idea of the computer as theatre; Turkle

    as Rorschach inkblot; Kay as medium; Nelson as moviemaker, Weiser as ubiquitous

    facility-pens, paper, and the electricity grid&quot; (Coyne, 1995, p. 253).</p>

    <p>The overall conceptual metaphor used for the AMOL interface and information

    architecture was drawn from the origins of the museum 16<sup>th</sup> century

    &#145;wunderkammer&#146; or 'wonder cabinet'. As Graziose Corrin notes (in her analysis of

    Mark Dion's installation work based on critique of the &#145;collector&#146; mentality,

    and modes of museum classification) the form of the wonder cabinet allowed:

    &quot;...arbitrary visual arrangements [which] seemed natural and capable of revealing

    knowledge that was at once empirical and metaphorical without the need for accompanying

    texts&quot; (Graziose Corrin, 1997, p. 53.)</p>

    <p>Further, in the birth of the museum as a field of specialized disciplines such as art

    and science, we have seen the: &quot;amputation of the limbs of inquiry from the body of

    knowledge and experience [which] marks a decisive rupture in the concept of the nature as

    infinitely variable and uncontainable&quot; (Graziose Corrin, 1997, p. 54).</p>

    <p>I believe that many of the debates that are circulating through New Museology and

    internet commentary seek to recreate that juncture of ideas represented by the 'wonder

    cabinet'. The purpose is to reintroduce interdisciplinary and cross-referenced access to

    collections. Using a traditional museum icon such as the wonder cabinet provides a

    familiar access point for the user but in an environment where the user has autonomy and

    authority to access the variety of resources. <a href="#toc"><small>[table of contents]</small></a></p>

    <h3><a name="new"></a>New projects</h3>

    <p>The key projects to be implemented on the new AMOL web site during 1998 reflect the

    pragmatic design approach and engagement with the opportunities to meet museum needs,

    together with the guide of the On-line Working Party. Some of the new initiatives are

    described below. <a href="#toc"><small>[table of contents]</small></a></p>

    <h4><a name="a"></a>A. Metadata at the meta-center</h4>

    <blockquote>

      <p>&quot;Although we often hear that data speak for themselves, their voices can be soft

      and sly&quot; (Monsteller et al, 1983, Beginning statistics with data analysis in Tufte

      1997, p. 26).</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Using metadata tags (commonly described as 'data about data') it is possible to make

    the information on web sites and stored across disparate database more visible to a

    variety of search engine queries. This attribute exists alongside those of: <ul>

      <li>enabling material to be retrieved in context;</li>

      <li>expanding the uses to which data is put;</li>

      <li>enabling multi versioning; </li>

      <li>data use in legal issues and the tracking of rights and reproductions; and</li>

      <li>in supporting preservation through the migration across computer systems; and </li>

      <li>as a way of providing benchmark data about systems that allows for re-design and

        enhancement in a cost-effective manner (Gilliland-Swetland, 1998, pp. 6-9).</li>

    </ul>

    <p>A valuable discussion on the implications and quest for metadata and resource

    interoperability and discovery can be found in <i>Introduction to Metadata: pathways to

    digital information</i> (Baca, 1998).</p>

    <p>The AMOL Coordination Unit is now mapping all its data to the Dublin Core profile (in a

    world wide test-bed project involving 21 museum members run through CIMI, <a

    href="http://www.cimi.org/documents/metafinalPD.html" target="_blank">http://www.cimi.org/documents/metafinalPD.html</a>).

    AMOL Coordination Unit will markup subsequent information created for the site with author

    generated descriptions of the web site resources, to provide access to AMOL&#146;s

    heterogeneous resources. The purpose of the test-bed project is to define museum resources

    in a standard that will be supported by major software vendors, search engines and by the

    whole spectrum of world museums. For a further description please see Hofmann and Miller

    (1999, <a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw99/abstracts/prg_1128.html">http://www.archimuse.com/mw99/abstracts/prg_1128.html</a>).</p>

    <p>The AMOL Coordination Unit is also investigating the use of XML in relation to future

    work on the web site. <br>

    <a href="#toc"><small>[table of contents]</small></a></p>

    <h4><a name="b"></a>B. Knowledge domain</h4>

    <p>The core data set for AMOL contains five fields. However, it has been increasingly

    recognized that the provision of such a subset of museums information is devoid of context

    and meaning (for example see recent arguments put forward by CHIN, 1998). The core

    collections records database will now be supplemented with cross-reference to more

    extensive contextual information. The knowledge domain will expand to contain an

    encyclopaedia of museum stories, associated media files, and author details. <br>

    <a href="#toc"><small>[table of contents]</small></a></p>

    <h4><a name="c"></a>C. Creation of stories</h4>

    <p>Behind the scenes of AMOL is a wealth of people in regional museums who wish to express

    what they value and what they preserve for the collective memory of their communities.

    AMOL is bringing this material together for the first time in the form of on-line stories

    (<a href="http://amol.org.au/guide/stories_index.asp" target="_blank">http://amol.org.au/guide/stories_index.asp</a>).

    A review of the submissions that are sent to AMOL reveal aspects of Australian culture

    that have hitherto been restricted to a small number of on-site visitors.</p>

    <p>The project structure ensures that contributing museums have a sense of ownership in

    the development of their material. Also, the on-line environments support equal status for

    the stories negating domination by museums of high national profile. The stream of stories

    and resources is cumulative, possibly mutating and cross-linking over time. <br>

    <a href="#toc"><small>[table of contents]</small></a></p>

    <h4><a name="d"></a>D. Open Museum Journal</h4>

    <p>The Open Museum Journal (<a href="http://amol.org.au/craft/omjournal/journal_index.asp"

    target="_blank">http://amol.org.au/craft/omjournal/journal_index.asp</a>) publishes

    scholarly and applied research and commentary on museums. It is a collaborative venture

    between the Research Institute of Cultural Heritage (<a

    href="http://www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/dept/rich/" target="_blank">http://www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/dept/rich/</a>)

    at Curtin University of Technology in Western Australia and AMOL. </p>

    <p>There are very few opportunities for those with an interest in the way Australian

    cultural heritage is managed and interpreted in our museums, galleries and historic sites

    to publish the results of their study. This is the case for both academics working in

    museum and cultural heritage studies departments, for heritage practitioners working in

    museums, galleries and historic sites themselves and for postgraduate students working at

    Diploma, Masters and Ph.D. level on museum related topics. The Open Museum Journal

    provides a low cost opportunity for this (for recent debates on the viability of on-line

    academic publishing refer to the recent conference on Scholarly Communications and

    Technology, <a href="http://arl.cni.org/scomm/scat/" target="_blank">http://arl.cni.org/scomm/scat/</a>).

    </p>

    <p>The Journal operates a fully double blind peer review process. The various files

    related to each article are contained in a database. The database has a web interface to

    allow all members of the distributed editorial committee to upload and have access to the

    relevant files and articles. <br>

    <h4><a name="e"></a>E. The <em>Pandora</em> Chronicle</h4>

    <p>AMOL&#146;s most recent project has been the live broadcast of the <em>Pandora</em>

    shipwreck excavation. The <em>Pandora</em> Chronicle (<a

    href="../../../www.amol.org.au/pandora/pandora_index.html"

    target="_blank">http://www.amol.org.au/pandora/pandora_index.asp</a>) daily diary

    (February 28, 1999 until the end of March) for the excavation was uploaded via satellite

    phone to the AMOL server. With the excavation taking place two days steaming off the

    Queensland Coast this project demonstrates the internet as a space that can offer provide

    <h3><a name="future"></a>AMOL Futures</h3>

    <p>There has been a 70% increase in users since the re-launch. Analysis tracking the user

    has tended to confirm that users are adapting to the new navigational structure in a

    predicable way. A formal study has been commissioned of the web site that hopes to draw in

    traditional forms of museological evaluation (similar to the approach taken by Teather,

    1998, 1999). </p>

    <p>After 2001 the original funding support for AMOL finishes. Having now reached a

    threshold of data that makes for a viable and valuable resource decisions have to be made

    how best to structure the organization to ensure the collective operations. There is a

    need also to examine the role of bureaucracy and how it impacts on the design and

    management of the site itself. </p>

    <p>Investigation into possible markets for expansion of the AMOL model overseas (say the

    Pacific Ocean) could also be researched. The development of the model, its scripts and

    functions as defined by the current web site could usefully be developed to help other

    initiatives offshore.</p>

    <p>There are numerous other avenues for development both theoretical and practical that

    warrant further research. Theoretical arguments that seek to define the museum within the

    electronic environment are beginning to be published (for example New Media Australia,

    1998). AMOL now holds a large core of information resources for interpretation. I believe

    one of primary functions could be in research and development of tools for the greater

    museum community. <br>
