					<h5>Abstract</h5>
<p>When switched-on, the <em>ubiquitous museum </em>of the future should, as Foucault
intended, be able to function as a comprehensive archive of material culture with
the capability of operating in all places at all times. In the last few years we
have borne witness to the gradual realisation of this vision, as a new hybrid museum
form striving to re-connect the <em>physical</em> and <em>virtual </em>museum domains
has evolved. Since the first Museums and the Web conference in Los Angeles in 1997,
numerous papers, presentations and discussions have hinted at the opportunities,
as well as significant challenges, that the creation of this new ubiquitous hybrid
will undoubtedly entail.</p>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				  	<p>The modern museum emerged in the mid-19th century as a general archive,
				  	  enclosing in one place all times, all epochs, all forms, and all tastes
				  	  (Foucault, 1986). Established in 1879, my museum, the Powerhouse Museum,
				  	  gave life to this idea through an interpretive approach that, up until the
				  	  1940s, employed evolutionary narratives to move visitors forward through
				  	  predominantly artefactual environments. However, the pre-eminence of artefacts
				  	  and their position within the exhibition medium began to change after World
				  	  War II. An influx of cheap, pulp mass media, and later the arrival of television,
				  	  significantly altered Australian museum visitors&rsquo; media preferences.
				  	  To keep pace, the Powerhouse Museum quickly assimilated within its exhibits
				  	  photographs to give objects a sense of time and place, posters to provide
				  	  ambience and atmosphere, and electro-mechanical interactives to increase
				  	  visitor participation. </p><p>
				  	  Since the 1940s, the discipline of exhibition design and curatorship
				  	  has further evolved to provide shape, form and structure to these dissonant
				  	  analogue media. As curators and designers grew in confidence, their ability
				  	  to integrate and effectively use analogue media to create entertaining and
				  	  stimulating exhibits also grew. In the space of 10 short years from the
				  	  late 1980s, personal computing technologies took hold in many museums, and
				  	  their digital manifestations began to challenge the pre-eminence of artefacts.
				  	  What occurred was a paradigm shift for museums, where computer-based interactive
				  	  multimedia proved they could share &ldquo;centre-stage&rdquo; with museums&rsquo; collections.</p><p>
				  	  Quickly following the personal computer, the World Wide Web
				  	  emerged as an electronic outreach medium that was equally beguiling. Throughout
				  	  the 1990s, museums strove to reach beyond their walls, to infiltrate our
				  	  homes, classrooms and workplaces. In part, museums&rsquo; willingness to
				  	  embrace the Web was driven by the tantalizing opportunity it held out to
				  	  expand scholarly outreach. At the same time it promised a truly global audience
				  	  for knowledge products which as mere exhibitions and publications might
				  	  have reached only small, specialist, local audiences. For our collections,
				  	  the Web also promised exciting new possibilities: freed from their physicality
				  	  and locale, their digital simulacra were theoretically free to travel anywhere
				  	  at anytime. </p>
				  	<h2>First Generation Virtual Museums </h2>
				  	<p>At the beginning of the twenty-first century, museums find themselves at
				  	  the confluence of these two digital revolutions affecting interpretive practice
				  	  both inside and outside their walls. It is this confluence that has been
				  	  charted for over ten years at the Museums and the Web conference. For a
				  	  decade, starting back in Los Angeles in 1997, this unique forum has discussed
				  	  and debated these transformative forces. At these gatherings, and within
				  	  the published proceedings, we bore witness to the emergence of the first
				  	  generation of on-line cultural expressions. These were the <em>electronic
				  	  brochures</em>, <em>tour sites</em> and early experimental <em>interactive </em>cultural
				  	  institutional Web sites. </p><p>
				  	  By late 1997 it was estimated that there were as many as 8,000
				  	  museums and heritage sites on the Web, and at the time many typically utilised
				  	  text and imagery, re-purposed and recycled directly from the corporeal museum,
				  	  its exhibits and its promotional material. Most common from 1995 to early
				  	  1998 was the marketing or <em>electronic brochure </em>Web site<em>.</em> Typically
				  	  between one and three pages, these sites characteristically contained scant
				  	  detail. The market-orientation of these sites was a derivative of the 'just
				  	  in case' reasoning espoused by the first wave of e-businesses. 'Just in
				  	  case' visitors surfing the net might wish to visit your museum, they could
				  	  find sufficient information to know where to find you, what admission cost,
				  	  and what programs were showing. </p><p>
				  	  These <em>electronic brochure</em> sites were relatively inexpensive to
				  	  create and so operated as important entry level products. From here many
				  	  museums progressed to making a <em>tour site</em> which placed increasing
				  	  emphasis on graphical and spatial representations of the museum&rsquo;s
				  	  galleries and collection. Both types of early <em>virtual museums </em>were
				  	  typically unidirectional and operated predominantly as digital simulacra
				  	  of their physical institutions. At the time, many were unable to deliver
				  	  the interactive, multi-media, and rich database-driven content that went
				  	  on to characterise the second generation of <em>virtual museums.</em></p><p>
				  	  The consensual hallucination imagined by William Gibson in
				  	  his visionary text <em>Neuromancer</em> is now a reality, with over one
				  	  billion people using the Internet in 2005. As well as being a ubiquitous
				  	  publishing, communication, design, and research tool, the Internet has emerged
				  	  as a powerful communication medium. Museums are not alone in exploiting
				  	  this potential; however, the learning, promotion and scholarly outreach
				  	  initiatives our sector has created are truly unique. Museums have successfully
				  	  forged a distinctive partnership with the Internet, and over 100 years of
				  	  object-based communication has in the last five years melded with second-
				  	  generation Web-affordance technologies, including OAI, IRC and Flash. In
				  	  turn these gave rise to the distinctive forms of early twenty-first century <em>virtual
				  	  museums</em>, many of the very <em>e-service</em>, <em>metacenter</em>, <em>Web-cast</em> and <em>electronic-field
				  	  trip</em> genres that will be discussed, critiqued and celebrated at MW2006
				  	  in Albuquerque.</p>
				  	<h2>Ubiquitous Museum Affordances</h2>
				  	<p>The term affordance was coined by the psychologist James Gibson to describe
				  	  the potential for action, the perceived capacity of an object to enable
				  	  the assertive will of the actor (Gibson, 1979). The term is now commonly
				  	  used, particularly in new media and industrial design, to refer to an object
				  	  or system that has been specifically designed to work with the intentions,
				  	  perceptions, and abilities of users. Working within these parameters, good
				  	  affordance technologies reduce the probability of confusing or non-productive
				  	  user behaviour. Thus, they specifically promote productive and creative
				  	  interventions by users. Importantly, technology and media have affordances
				  	  to the extent that they promise extended human capabilities of seeing, hearing,
				  	  and uttering. </p><p>
				  	  Whilst face-to-face interactivity remains an important component
				  	  of the museum visit, nowadays this is not the pre-eminent interactivity
				  	  that many, particularly younger visitors, actively seek in museums. Rather,
				  	  they expect automated or mediated interactive experiences, the touch trail,
				  	  plasma ball or virtual fish tank. Mediated interactivity in museums has
				  	  been popular since 1969, when McLuhan, Parker and Barzun first demonstrated
				  	  how new communications technologies could enhance visitor participation
				  	  in exhibits (McLuhan, Parker &amp; Barzun, 1969). Their assertion that visitor
				  	  understanding and interest in linear artefactual story lines was limited
				  	  marked a turning point in curatorial and exhibition design practice. To
				  	  increase visitor interest, they advocated bombarding visitors' senses with
				  	  a variety of media to stimulate them into absorbing more information. In
				  	  the same way, McLuhan and Parker contended that museum visitors ultimately
				  	  have limited interest in traditional narrative forms. I believe visitors
				  	  may have similar reservations about purely automated, interactive multimedia
				  	  experiences. Experience has taught me that visitors have divergent media
				  	  appetites; therefore, many of us strive to offer up a rich array of artefactual,
				  	  automated <strong>and </strong>face-to-face interactive experiences. </p><p>
				  	  However, at this particular moment in the history of museums
				  	  and the Web, I fear we have created a divide - a separation of physical
				  	  and on-line museum domains - which only now are we beginning to bridge.
				  	  As we shall see, this is not because of any lack of interest or desire to
				  	  re-unite the <em>virtual</em> and <em>physical</em> museum. Rather, we have
				  	  been waiting on the maturing of a number of key affordance technologies.
				  	  As is shown here at Museums and the Web, a range of new technologies and
				  	  techniques is facilitating a re-integration of these domains. From this
				  	  is emerging a new hybrid museum experience, a ubiquitous place where face-to-face
				  	  and automated interactivity sit side by side.</p>
				  	<h2>Re-Connecting Physical And Virtual Domains</h2>
				  	<p>Network technologies and radio communications were first brought together
				  	  in 1971, at the University of Hawaii. And while ALOHANET may have been born
				  	  over thirty-five years ago, the first Internet-enabled mobile 3G devices
				  	  began to appear in Korea, Japan and Europe in 2001 and have spread elsewhere
				  	  very slowly. Similarly, museums have been hesitant early adopters of 3G.
				  	  However, in the last eighteen months this has turned around, and many major
				  	  museums have begun to make significant investments. Together with these
				  	  wireless affordance technologies, many have also begun to embrace XML-based
				  	  RSS (Rich Site Summary) and broadband multimedia casting technologies. As
				  	  we shall see, together these are ushering in the brave new world of the <em>ubiquitous
				  	  museum</em>. But this desire to reconnect the <em>physical</em> and <em>virtual</em> realms
				  	  of museums brings both opportunities and an array of significant challenges. </p><p>
				  	  How many times in the 1990s did we hear colleagues passionately
				  	  contend that the Web would significantly reduce the number of visitors to &ldquo;real&rdquo; museums?
				  	  At the heart of this contention lay a fundamental contradiction many found
				  	  difficult to reconcile: that the authority and power of cultural institutions
				  	  was being undermined from within, by its very own digital progeny. As an
				  	  epiphenomenon that cannot be physically perceived or meaningfully located
				  	  in space or time, we can&rsquo;t be surprised that <em>virtual museums</em> represented
				  	  such a threat to many working within the sector. After all, the very existence
				  	  of museums had until quite recently been largely predicated on the primacy
				  	  of the real. However what I have observed, over the last five years, is
				  	  a gradual dissipation of these anxieties. This is happening at a time when
				  	  a new set of Web-based affordance technologies are beginning to emerge to
				  	  breathe life into the new notion of a <em>ubiquitous museum</em> which as
				  	  a fulcrum has the physical museum and its knowledge workforce. </p><p>
				  	  Stepping back for a moment from the philosophical roots of
				  	  the <em>ubiquitous museum</em>, it&rsquo;s time to focus on the practical,
				  	  functional and real challenges of attaining such a state. For seven years
				  	  I have been a speaker, judge and program committee member for Museums and
				  	  the Web. During this time I have witnessed first hand the iterative processes
				  	  and emerging technologies that cumulatively have moved many cultural institutions
				  	  on from virtual to ubiquitous states. Not surprisingly, the process typically
				  	  begins with artefact digitisation and progresses to public dissemination
				  	  of knowledge products on-line via open public access catalogues (OPAC),
				  	  collection focused microsites, and a variety of interactive multimedia.
				  	  Traditionally this accumulation of digital interpretive media sufficed for
				  	  the <em>virtual museum</em>. However, critically, the ubiquitous museum
				  	  seeks to open new channels for face-to-face mediated interaction, as well
				  	  as automated dialogue. To achieve this it strives to connect digital and
				  	  analogue media, hard and soft knowledge. Together these establish the possibility
				  	  of an always-on, user-centred interaction between visitors, museum media
				  	  and museum staff. Therein the <em>ubiquitous museum</em> makes no distinction
				  	  between virtual and real visitation: instead, it seeks to provide opportunities
				  	  and technology to support the continual and cyclical use of the museum&rsquo;s
				  	  entire knowledge arsenal. </p><p>
				  	  The consequence of such a holistic approach is the reinstatement
				  	  of the physical museum as a focal point for visitor activity and knowledge
				  	  production. That is, users of on-line electronic services are proactively
				  	  encouraged to attend and make use of the physical museum, its exhibits and
				  	  its staff. And in turn, visitors to the physical museum are actively encouraged
				  	  to dip into the museum&rsquo;s electronic outreach services. In summary,
				  	  the <em>ubiquitous museum</em> utilises an array of affordance technologies
				  	  and techniques to nurture a symbiotic relationship between both <em>physical </em>and <em>virtual </em>museum
				  	  domains.</p><p>
				  	  At this time, the attainment of such a perfect symbiotic state
				  	  is rare, and few if any museums can lay claim to having deployed successful
				  	  solutions. But during the last three years of Museums and the Web, we have
				  	  seen the emergence of a number of exemplars which point the way. Some of
				  	  these have utilised new and emerging affordance technologies in an effort
				  	  to reconnect digital and analogue, soft and hard, knowledge domains, whilst
				  	  others like <em>Art Safari</em> sought out pedagogical solutions that <em>blend</em> both
				  	  digital and analogue publishing media (Schwartz &amp; Burnette, 2004).</p>
				  	<h2>Integrated Publishing</h2>
				  	<p>As Schwartz and Burnette observed in their paper <em>Making Websites for
				  	    Younger Audiences</em> at Museums and the Web 2004, it is a peculiar anomaly
				  	    that nearly all current on-line museum learning services are targeted
				  	    at secondary and tertiary students. However, there are a small number
				  	    of cultural institutions that have made it their mission to meet the needs
				  	    of young children and their parents on-line. The Museum of Modern Art
				  	    (MOMA) is one of these, and over a number of years has regularly produced
				  	    on-line resources for 5 to 8 years olds. One of my particular favourites
				  	    is <em>Art Safari</em> (<a href="http://artsafari.moma.org/" target="_blank">http://artsafari.moma.org/</a>). </p><p>
				  	  With <em>Art Safari, </em>MOMA successfully developed a suite of activities
				  	  for this age group, that as well as promoting learning online,
				  	  critically for our
				  	  deliberations, also actively promotes visitation
				  	  and use of MOMA&rsquo;s galleries and other printed media. <em>Art Safari </em>uses
				  	  paintings and sculpture from MOMA&rsquo;s collection to help children develop
				  	  their observation skills. The site was specially designed to include creative
				  	  play activities that encourage students to examine and respond on-line,
				  	  via a digital palette, to the forms, stories, and characters that populate
				  	  the artworks of Rousseau, Kahlo, Rivera, and Picasso. Creative play is an
				  	  important part of young children&rsquo;s learning and describes those experiences
				  	  that encourage them to explore and test ideas through the process of making. </p><p>
				  	  Significantly, the <em>Art Safari</em> Web site does not operate in isolation.
				  	  Like many art gallery Web sites, its primary reference is to MOMA&rsquo;s
				  	  galleries and artworks. But unlike many other Web-based projects, <em>Art
				  	  Safari </em>also has a complementary, printed publication of the same name
				  	  (Raimondo, 2004). Joyce Raimondo&rsquo;s book extends the creative play
				  	  approach of the Web site through a series of activities and, like the Web
				  	  site, constantly makes reference to eight specific artworks on regular display
				  	  at MOMA. In educational circles this is what is known as a blended learning
				  	  technique. </p><p>
				  	  Blended learning facilitates learning by deliberately combining
				  	  different modes of delivery, models of teaching and styles of learning (Heinze
				  	  and Proctor, 2004). It is constituted from a series of educational experiences
				  	  that deliberately integrate e-learning techniques, including on-line delivery
				  	  of materials through Web pages, discussion boards and/or e-mail with traditional
				  	  teaching methods and media. The unique blended learning approach developed
				  	  for <em>Art Safari</em> not only ensured that divergent user media preferences
				  	  could be accommodated, but also in so doing significantly increased the
				  	  probability of a parent and child&rsquo;s visiting the MOMA&rsquo;s galleries.
				  	  What&rsquo;s more, whilst the Web site was perfectly placed to respond to
				  	  the family&rsquo;s pre-visit needs, the book operated as the ideal post-visit
				  	  momento. Thus together the Web site, gallery and book provided a holistic
				  	  visitor experience which at the same time as it promoted off-line and on-line
				  	  learning pushed learners to visit the museum.</p><p>
				  	  Both the <em>Art Safari</em> Web site and the book not only make constant
				  	  reference to one another, but also very consciously promote the primacy
				  	  and value of visiting &ldquo;original art&rdquo;. This desire by developers
				  	  to encourage parents and young children to seek out the Museum and its artworks
				  	  is more than good marketing. In reality the developers recognised that learning
				  	  about art either on-line or in a printed publication has particular limitations.
				  	  After all, simulations and reproductions are basically analogies, and can
				  	  only truly be meaningful if there are prior or mediation experiences that
				  	  allow the analogy to be properly understood by coming face to face with
				  	  the original artwork. It is this specific ability of allowing visitors to
				  	  compare and contrast digital models, reproductions and analogies with their
				  	  physical counterparts that is one of the <em>ubiquitous museum&rsquo;s</em> intrinsic
				  	  strengths.</p>
				  	<h2>Electronic Field Trips</h2>
				  	<p>As we have already seen, the <em>ubiquitous museum</em> makes no distinction
				  	  between virtual and real visitation. Instead, it constantly seeks to use
				  	  technology and develop opportunities to support the continual use and re-purposing
				  	  of a museum&rsquo;s entire knowledge arsenal. Another of my favourite examples
				  	  of just this expansive knowledge-asset use is the Liberty Science Center&rsquo;s
				  	  (LSC) <em>e-connection</em>, video teleconferencing program. Here video-teleconferencing
				  	  technologies connect expert museum commentators and exhibits within the
				  	  LSC to a classroom of students anywhere in the state of New Jersey. For
				  	  many years the LSC has been a regular contributor to Museums and the Web,
				  	  and in 2002 it was my pleasure to see a number of their e-connection programs.</p><p>
				  	  LSC is connected to the state-wide ISDN/ATM, New Jersey Department
				  	  of Education&rsquo;s Distance Learning Network, which allows schools all
				  	  across New Jersey to link via video conference to the LSC&rsquo;s EFT (Electronic
				  	  Field Trip) lab, located in Union City. As well as being able to access
				  	  this specially equipped facility, students can also directly access many
				  	  of the LSC&rsquo;s permanent exhibits viaa series of e-connection programs,
				  	  e.g., the <em>Aquatic Ecosystems &ndash; Estuaries</em> package. This activity
				  	  links a class of upper primary students studying river ecosystems to a biologist
				  	  based in the LSC&rsquo;s Hudson River aquarium. After a brief introduction,
				  	  a camera scans tanks of toadfish, eels, and spider crabs. A series of carefully
				  	  choreographed activities then follows, prompting students to ask questions
				  	  about the habitat and behaviour of each species.</p><p>
				  	  What the LSC has created is a genuinely unique experience that
				  	  neither a visit to the aquarium nor a conversation with the Biologist could
				  	  provide on its own. Instead, the experience emerges from the performance
				  	  of the museum&rsquo;s individual exhibits, together with the dialogue facilitation
				  	  skill and subject knowledge of the attending biologist. Bringing these together
				  	  is the unique affordance of real time, streaming audio and video technology.
				  	  Taken to its logical conclusion, this form of <em>ubiquitous museum</em> experience
				  	  could, if we were able to put aside time differences, theoretically connect
				  	  museum workers and exhibits to classrooms anywhere in the world. However,
				  	  such an exciting possibility throws up some equally compelling challenges.
				  	  If future museums are to successfully embed exhibits within the fabric of
				  	  the Internet, they will need to create exhibitions with component media
				  	  that are capable of operating as highly flexible knowledge nodes. From the
				  	  outset, we will need to design and create exhibits able to simultaneously
				  	  meet both physical and virtual visitor needs. With many museums now using
				  	  wireless networks within their exhibits, the potential for this kind of
				  	  experience is growing. While the allure of streaming audio and video affordances
				  	  is in part responsible for pushing many of us down this path, there are
				  	  also some sobering reasons for museums to embrace this kind of experience.
				  	  This is one of a number of affordances that may ensure <em>ubiquitous museums</em> can
				  	  stay connected to audiences that are increasingly inclined towards home-based
				  	  entertainment and classroom-centred activities. </p>
				  	<h2>From Syndication To Personalisation</h2>
				  	<p>Whilst real time video and audio-facilitated interactions with museum knowledge
				  	  workers will, for the foreseeable future, be only available as carefully
				  	  choreographed visits, other affordance technologies offer far more opportunistic
				  	  interactions. Particularly popular with content aggregation repositories
				  	  like national cultural portals, RSS (Rich Site Summary) is an affordance
				  	  technology that facilitates automated content syndication and information
				  	  personalisation. </p><p>
				  	  The emergence of national cultural portals can be traced back
				  	  to the late 1990s. Here in the USA, Europe and Australasia, the idea of
				  	  on-line national heritage collections became a reality after Internet privatisation
				  	  and the large-scale adoption of computerised collection information systems
				  	  by major cultural institutions. National governments, particularly those
				  	  with far flung regional and remote constituents, were some of the first
				  	  to recognise the potential of aggregating collection databases and distributing
				  	  these on-line. From this emerged a genuinely virtual institution, less a
				  	  single museum than a metacenter. These were digital hybrids that made use
				  	  of Open Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) technology, together with listserv,
				  	  style sheet and OAI applications. And by the late nineties, these cultural
				  	  portals had evolved into three distinct metacenter forms: institutional,
				  	  public and professional metacenters.</p><p>
				  	  The first generation of government sponsored cultural portals
				  	  tended towards the professional metacenters, and included the likes of the
				  	  Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN, <a href="http://www.chin.gc.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.chin.gc.ca/</a>) and
				  	  Australian Museums and Galleries Online (AMOL, <a href="http://amol.org.au/" target="_blank">http://amol.org.au/</a>). While
				  	  the numbers of these professionally focused projects has remained few, in
				  	  the last three years other portal types have experienced considerable growth.
				  	  Culture.mondo estimates currently there are as many as 250 now operating
				  	  worldwide. In part this growth is a direct response to increasing demand
				  	  from cultural tourists for quality assured information on museum events.
				  	  To attend to this demand, newer portals have looked to simplify and streamline
				  	  their content creation and management approaches. Pre-eminent among the
				  	  new affordances are many embracing content syndication technologies. These
				  	  offer the possibility of not only automated content harvesting and distribution,
				  	  but also highly personalised content production.</p>
				  	  <p>
				  	  A winner of the Best of the Web for E-services in 2003, the
				  	  24 Hour Museum is a world leader in RSS adoption. The 24 Hour
				  	    Museum is the UK&rsquo;s National Virtual Museum (<a href="http://www.24hrmuseum.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.24hrmuseum.org.uk/</a>),
				  	  a cultural portal that actively promotes publicly funded UK
				  	    museums, galleries, archives and cultural tourism sites.
				  	    By definition it&rsquo;s a virtual
				  	  project charged with the task of directly encouraging the visiting
				  	    of museums. Each year the 24 Hour Museum's team of freelance
				  	    writers routinely
				  	    composes 100's of stories. As the British cultural sectors
				  	      major on-line
				  	    content creator, the team was aware of the untapped syndication
				  	    potential of this content. The problem was the lack of a
				  	    cost effective
				  	    way to customise and distribute content. That was until September
				  	    2003,
				  	    when the 24 Hour Museum quietly switched on its first RSS
				  	    news feed to
				  	    <a href="http://www.newsnow.com/" target="_blank">www.newsnow.com</a>.
				  	    The 24 Hour Museum now has 14 RSS news feeds picked up
				  	    by organisations as diverse as the Wessex Archaeological
				  	    website, Google
			  	      News Facility and <a href="http://www.syndic8.com/" target="_blank">www.syndic8.com</a>. </p>
				  	  <p>The 24 Hour Museum team uses RSS technology to not only re-package and
				  	    customise content for news and cultural websites, but has
				  	      plans to
				  	    develop specific user-centred feeds for school children.
				  	    It's clear as
				  	    RSS evolves it will continue to allow cultural institutions
				  	    to modify
				  	    knowledge products to better align with the perceived needs,
				  	    aspirations
				  	    and desires of virtual visitors. However, this is not a one-way
				  	    street.
				  	    Whilst current RSS technology privileges cultural institutions
				  	    ensuring
				  	    they maintain authorial control, the advent of user-operated
				  	    RSS
				  	    programs will undoubtedly shift the authorial balance away
				  	    from
		  	    institutions, towards individual online visitors.</p>
				  	  <p>
				  	  RSS is an XML-based format which is now widely used by major
				  	  on-line services and is commonly available as a free download on news service
				  	  sites; it now also appears in some blogs. In the case of the 24 Hour Museum,
				  	  information syndication and customisation have been strictly governed by
				  	  a set of editorial rules. However, as RSS spreads, more sophisticated user-centred
				  	  algorithms are emerging to allow for much greater information customisation.
				  	  In future it is possible to imagine that our on-line visitors may very easily
				  	  be able to build their very own, highly personalised <em>ubiquitous museums</em>.
				  	  From a curatorial perspective this possibility raises a number of concerns.
				  	  Left unchecked, such personalisation has the potential to undermine information
				  	  authenticity, accuracy and appropriateness: the hallmarks and USP of the
				  	  on-line cultural sector. The concern is that left unchecked, RSS affordances
				  	  could perpetrate misinformation and confusion. And it is the avoidance of
				  	  this very information anarchy that has driven the development and regulation
				  	  of data management systems in museums from the time of the first collection
				  	  inventory. But a solution is in hand.</p><p>
				  	  Research into effective learning in museums has already demonstrated
				  	  that visitors by necessity rely upon their own conceptual frameworks - their
				  	  unique knowledge and experience - to interpret and understand all they encounter
				  	  in museums. Traditionally they tend to read media texts within museums either
				  	  to reinforce these, or incrementally extend pre-existing ideas to develop
				  	  new cognitive frameworks. Similarly curators and designers, the principal
				  	  authors of Web-based exhibits, have their own conceptual frameworks which
				  	  tend to be educational. So one of the challenges for future RSS developers
				  	  will be to utilise technological solutions to accommodate not only the cognitive
				  	  needs of visitors, but also those of museum knowledge workers. To bring
				  	  about this conceptual synthesis, future systems will ultimately need to
				  	  customise content using sophisticated algorithms that bring together more
				  	  erudite visitor, curator and educator models. In essence they will need
				  	  to bring to life the <em>MoMo</em> model so passionately espoused by Javier
				  	  Jaen and the team from the Polytechnic University of Valencia at the 2005
				  	  Museums and the Web conference in Vancouver (Jaen et al., 2005).</p>
				  	<h2>Wireless Ubiquity </h2>
				  	<p>In response to the ubiquity of portable MP3 players, many museums have
				  	  embraced the potential of wireless, PDAs, 3G handsets and tablet PCs. The
				  	  term <strong>wireless</strong> refers to telecommunication technology in
				  	  which radio waves, infrared waves and microwaves, instead of wires, are
				  	  used to carry a signal between communication devices. The potential of this
				  	  technology inside and outside museum walls is seemingly boundless. Current
				  	  video-teleconferencing technology can create a rich interactive experience
				  	  within the fixed domains of specially equipped classrooms and exhibits.
				  	  Alternatively, wireless multimedia players are constrained only by the network
				  	  footprint. The geographical freedom this affords sets up the exciting possibility
				  	  of connecting the museum to any leisure, education or work domain. All of
				  	  a sudden a playground, a bedroom, an airport lounge or a bus stop all become
				  	  potential museum venues. But just why would a museum want to connect their
				  	  staff and exhibits to such places? As long as wireless networks&rsquo; ability
				  	  to support real time, high quality streaming audio visual is constrained
				  	  by bandwidth and museum staff by working hours, the possibility of such
				  	  access beyond museum walls will for many be problematic. Instead, the vast
				  	  majority will continue to be restricted to variants of the automated-interactive
				  	  experiences already available on-line. While the growth of the knowledge
				  	  economy will undoubtedly increase demands for certain museum education and
				  	  training services, there is currently lacking a cogent argument to justify
				  	  the human and financial investments necessary to build an &ldquo;always
				  	  on&rdquo; wireless network that facilitates interaction between visitors,
				  	  staff and a physical museum&rsquo;s exhibits.</p><p>
				  	  On the contrary, there is a compelling case for continued integration
				  	  of wireless mobile technology within the fabric of physical exhibits and
				  	  throughout the museum. The promise here is the facilitation of greater visitor
				  	  interaction and engagement with exhibitions (McLuhan and Parker). At the
				  	  same time this should ensure museums maintain a contemporary leisure and
				  	  learning approach; that is, one cognisant of the types and forms of mediated
				  	  social interaction that are particularly important for younger visitors.
				  	  Here the challenge is principally facilitating meaningful dialogue between
				  	  visitors. But this may be easier said than done and has been the subject
				  	  of numerous papers dating back over five years at Museums and the Web. </p>
				  	  <p>
				  	  Papers exploring the practical use of wireless devices within
				  	  museums and art galleries first appeared in 2001. In Seattle,
				  	    Judith Kirk described the Mather&rsquo;s Museum&rsquo;s early work with
				  	    a wireless computing device called MUSEpad (Kirk, 2001).
				  	    Five years later, interest in wireless handhelds has grown
				  	    to account for two sessions in Albuquerque. A common theme
				  	    in all these papers is the challenge of developing systems that consciously
				  	    support social interaction between visitors. Whilst many museum system
				  	    developers have attempted to tackle this problem head on, one of the most
				  	    ambitious is the Sotto Voce system presented in Boston in 2002. The Woodruff
				  	    and Aoki paper <em>Eavesdropping
				  	    on Electronic Guidebooks</em> discusses the challenges
				  	  of developing the Sotto Voce electronic guide for the Filoli
				  	    historic house, situated 30 miles south of San Francisco
				  	    (Woodruff et al., 2002). </p>
				  	  <p>
				  	  S<em>otto </em>Voce is a wireless, handheld guide designed by a PARC Xerox
				  	  team to allow visitors to explore Filoli&rsquo;s many eclectically furnished
				  	  rooms. To achieve this it set about encouraging visitors to learn about
				  	  the history of Filoli principally by encouraging real time dialogue, questioning
				  	  and conversation amongst the human users of other Sotto Voce guides. To
				  	  do this, Sotto Voce included a feature called <em>eavesdropping</em> that
				  	  promoted shared visitor activity. This allowed companions to share audio
				  	  information by eavesdropping on one another&rsquo;s comments, questions
				  	  commentary and responses.</p><p>
				  	  Over a number of years the research presented by Woodruff and
				  	  Aoki clearly demonstrated that significant levels of visitor-to-visitor
				  	  interaction could indeed be achieved through these wireless guides. Significantly
				  	  this Xerox PARC project, along with other more recent projects at the Tate
				  	  Modern (Parry &amp; Arbach, 2005), has demonstrated that machine mediated
				  	  interaction can also promote educationally meaningful human-to-human interaction.
				  	  After all, it&rsquo;s this human to human interface that&rsquo;s so much
				  	  a part of what we know makes a visit to a museum so enjoyable, as well as
				  	  educationally effective. As Hood (1983), Uzzell (1989) and later Falk and
				  	  Dierking&rsquo;s (2000) research has demonstrated, in order for museums
				  	  to continue to operate as attractive education and leisure destinations,
				  	  they need to actively support this kind of basic social interaction. That
				  	  is the face-to-face dialogue and questioning between brother and sister,
				  	  mother and father, student and teacher. Thus the continuing challenge for
				  	  developers of wireless handheld guides will be to consciously look for solutions
				  	  that avoid the often socially isolating consequences of so many current
				  	  electronic guides.<u></u></p>
				  	<h2>The Future Of Objects In A Ubiquitous Museum</h2>
				  	<p>When switched-on, future <em>ubiquitous museums </em>should, as Foucault
				  	  intended, be able to function as comprehensive archives of material culture,
				  	  capable of operating in all places at all times. As we have already seen,
				  	  these hybrid institutions may in future be capable of simultaneously receiving,
				  	  re-composing and transmitting cultural messages. In all probability these
				  	  messages will be fleeting and their form determined by and large by our
				  	  visitor&rsquo;s needs, likes and dislikes. In essence, tomorrow&rsquo;s <em>ubiquitous
				  	  museum</em> will be less a place than a set of transitory ideas, all constantly
				  	  under construction and re-interpretation. Their presentation will be multifaceted
				  	  and multidimensional, making use of both fixed and mobile stations, within
				  	  both the Museum and the personal possession of our visitors. Their multimedia
				  	  content will be neither prescribed, nor directly authored; instead it will
				  	  evolve in response to the visitors&rsquo; unique psychological, physical
				  	  and social contexts. The closest analogy I can find is that of a knowledge
				  	  eco-system: an interconnected community of symbiotic curators, learners
				  	  and pleasure seekers, all bound together by mediating technologies, intent
				  	  on delivering face-to-face and machine-to-machine dialogue. However, like
				  	  any eco-system, the optimal state for the <em>ubiquitous museum</em> is
				  	  one of harmony between the needs of knowledge enablers and knowledge consumers.
				  	  Emerging from this system will undoubtedly be new education and leisure
				  	  paradigms, but I&rsquo;m convinced that at the centre we will continue to
				  	  find the museum object.</p><p>
				  	  As we move towards the twenty-first century, the accumulative
				  	  effects of interactive multimedia, both inside and outside museums, will
				  	  continue to raise compelling questions as to whether we can continue to
				  	  function as important object-orientated, education and leisure environments.
				  	  Indeed, what happens to the object in a ubiquitous world? Do we run the
				  	  gauntlet of ultimately discarding the physical in favour of the digital?
				  	  I would argue the contrary. The increasing virtuality of our world seems
				  	  to demand its own counterpoint in the materiality of those objects that
				  	  have withstood time. Far from diminishing it, <em>ubiquitous museums</em> will
				  	  surely intensify the need for emblematic objects that signify the extraordinariness
				  	  and ever-rarer primary nature of human experiences. </p>
