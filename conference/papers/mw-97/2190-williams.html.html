<h2>Parners, Profiles and the Public:<br>
Building a Virtual Museum Community</h2>

<p>Community and communication derive from the same Latin root, <i>communis
</i>, meaning shared, common, public <a href="#1">1</a>  The objectives of building a
common resource and maintaining good communications have been fundamental in the
development of partnerships between the heritage community and the Canadian
Heritage Information Network (CHIN).  The heritage community encompasses
institutions, professionals, and &quot;cultural consumers&quot; who share an
interest in our cultural and natural heritage.</p>
<p>What does it take to build community?  A common vision, mutual understanding
and recognition of the respective needs of each member are the foundation that
determines the shape the community will take.  Ideally, each member of a
community contributes and in return, receives benefits.   Respective
responsibilities are determined by the strengths, resources and requirements of
each of the members.  This relationship is embodied in the Heritage Community
that CHIN is fostering, in a system where institutions and individuals provide
content and, in return, CHIN develops and maintains the applications, support
and delivery mechanisms to bring content to &quot;cultural consumers&quot;.</p>
<p>A community will survive and prosper when the responsibilities of each
member are defined and when the costs and benefits are understood.  With reduced
government funding and in a competitive world, institutions and professionals
are finding new means to share their expertise and to reuse materials produced
for regular museum activities.  Museums have extensive experience in building
local communities.  Museum Associations have long been active in specific
functions such as advocacy and training.  There is less, but still some
experience, in collective action for mandated functions such as collections
acquisition, joint educational and promotional activities.  The Web offers great
opportunities for new types of &quot;virtual communities&quot; of museums and
museum professionals.</p>
<p>This paper will explore two examples of new information products that
demonstrate emerging museum communities and a &quot;membership&quot; approach
that has made them a reality.  The methodologies employed to develop and
maintain the products, as well as related time lines and resources are provided
as appendices.  This paper will also review the issues and methods used in
developing these products, the challenges that have been met and that remain. 
We believe that individual institutions will find elements of the CHIN
experience useful in building an internal culture that encourages the
participation of their own colleagues in the use, maintenance and development of
Web products.</p>
<p>CHIN and partners in the museum and heritage community have collaborated
recently to create two on-line products: <i>The Guide to Canadian Museums and
Galleries</i>, and the <i>Heritage Forum</i>. The <i>Guide</i> profiles
Canadian museums and galleries, providing current information on their
collections, services and attractions. The audience for the <i>Guide</i> is the
public.  The <i>Forum</i> is an interactive journal, providing current,
relevant, and organized information, such as studies, reports, and reference
material.  The audience is heritage and cultural workers seeking job related
information and professional development.  Both products are freely available at
the CHIN Web site <a href="http://www.chin.gc.ca/"><b>www.chin.gc.ca</b></a>.  </p>

<p>The <i>Guide</i> and the <i>Forum</i> are searchable centralized resources
with links to distributed information. In the current Web environment, both
novice and expert Internet users need effective access to information using
minimal effort. Data in two forms have been used to meet the need for assembling
information about Canadian museums and about resources for heritage
professionals: databases, which allow searches within a specialized body of
information; and distributed information, which links relevant, external Web
sites.  The <i>Guide</i> and <i>Forum </i>are designed to respond to a wide
variety of heritage community needs: new audiences, new revenue, improved access
to the information highway, help with technology for institutions at different
levels of technological development and training.</p>


<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>A strong community has grown over the past 25 years between Canadian museums
and CHIN.  This community<b> </b>has been based on shared collections
management, standards development and service provision from CHIN to its &quot;clients&quot;,
the museums.  Community members include 90 museums that are contributors to the
National Inventories and collections management clients.  This community also
includes professionals, museum associations and regional networks of museums. 
These are all linked in a closed system that encouraged sharing among members,
but had no direct link to external audiences and the broader heritage community.
</p>
<p>CHIN, a special operating agency of the federal Department of Canadian
Heritage, has a unique national mandate to invest in the development of
applications that are designed to support both preservation of and access to
museum collections and information.  In consultations held across Canada in the
spring of 1995, the views of Canadian museum directors and other leaders in the
heritage field were sought to help CHIN identify emerging needs.  With
remarkable consistency, changes were asked for.  In summary, these changes were
dictated by new developments in network technology, the growth of the Web, the
desire of many institutions to assume responsibility for their own collections
and information management functions and the fiscal realities facing all
institutions today.</p>
<p>In response to these changing needs CHIN's original mandate - to create the
National Inventories, to provide collections management services and to provide
technology assessment - was reviewed.  While CHIN has maintained its work with
the National Inventories, it is developing new ways of looking at standards and
new programs related to access to heritage information in a distributed
environment. The new mandate to &quot;broker effective access to Canadian and
international heritage information for public education and enjoyment and for
the collective benefit of Canadian museums&quot; reflects initiatives for
providing access to the museum community's professional resources and
collections of cultural and natural heritage.  CHIN thus acts as the &quot;gateway&quot;
to the Canadian heritage community, while  the community itself maintains the
content to which the public and professionals need access.</p>


<h3>Membership:</h3>
<p>New directions for CHIN are not only about new products and services, but
also about new attitudes.  Rather than clients of CHIN, the new mandate invites
museums to become members or partners with CHIN as joint contributors to a
collective resource.  The first tangible products that demonstrate the new
paradigm of membership and prove the principle that contributions bring
benefits, are the <i>Guide</i> and <i>Forum</i>.</p>

<p>The membership concept only works when there is both an underlying trust in
the motives and abilities of the contributors and constant communication. These
are key components in establishing and nurturing the <i>Guide</i> and <i>Forum
</i>. Initial discussions with several museums led to speedy - and positive -
reactions to the proposed prototype for the <i>Guide</i>, and later to the <i>Forum
</i>. With the rapid changes that characterize the Web environment,
communication and testing remain key factors in product development and
improvement.</p>
<p>Members of the heritage community are responsible for providing content, for
regularly updating to keep information current, and for promoting the products
within and outside the community. Thus, for the <i>Guide</i>, museums
contribute information about the institution (history and overview),
collections, services, events, and exhibitions; and for the <i>Forum</i>,
museum professionals contribute documents, reports, studies from working groups,
and newsletters, along with information about relevant Web sites, and dialogue
on current issues.  Overall both are designed to provide heightened profile for
institutions and efficient access to information.</p>
<p>Commitment to the products and sustained participation are encouraged by
offering tangible benefits to members.  CHIN offers <i>Guide</i> members free
Internet accounts, Internet training, and free access to its subscription
services.  Through the <i>Forum</i>, participants receive profile and an
opportunity for dialogue and critical reaction.  CHIN also provides the
technical expertise to develop all the applications, creates the databases,
indexing and navigation systems for the Web site and delivers the products. 
CHIN actively promotes the products through attendance and presentation at
conferences, mail-outs and distribution of promotional items.  CHIN finds
sponsors and is developing business outlets.  By creating and maintaining a
critical mass of useful, current information the collective resource continues
to grow and repeat visits to the site are encouraged.</p>


<h3>Audience:</h3>
<p>The audience base is more heterogeneous than ever before, expanding beyond
museum professionals, such as registrars, conservators, curators, educators, and
administrators to include new publics, such as tourists, the tourist industry,
students, and those with an interest - not necessarily professional - in
heritage. Determining audience needs requires research, analysis of existing
resource material, delivery mechanisms and awareness of new products. Monitoring
listservs, visiting Web sites, demonstrating the <i>Forum</i> and speaking with
colleagues at conferences have yielded considerable information about the
current interests and needs of heritage professionals. The <i>Guide</i> profits
from the expertise of tourism agencies, museum marketing and public relations
personnel and focus group testing.</p>
<p>Given the relative newness of the products, we are in the early stages of
proving longer term benefits and demonstrating success. <b> </b>We know that
approximately one third of the visits to the CHIN Web site involve the <i>Guide
</i> and one quarter involve the <i>Forum</i>.  CHIN is continuing to try out
various tools that can analyze the number and nature of Web visits, the type of
activity that is taking place and the areas that experience the most activity. 
The current limitations of the technology available for this type of analysis
pose a challenge in interpreting the Web statistics and in extracting
significant and useful information.  We endeavour to place the statistical data
within the context of these limitations in discussions with our members and
contributors.  With CHIN's experience with diverse Web products, we are
beginning to build meaningful statistical information that goes beyond the &quot;hit-list&quot;
that is often reported.  For our own evaluation purposes we need to establish a
norm for defining &quot;traffic&quot; at the site and then measure growth,
changes in demographics, seasonal flows, etc.</p>
<p>We are continuing to develop strategies to ascertain whether the products
are reaching the target audience, whether the products are, indeed, what the
audience is seeking, and whether the needs of the heritage community are being
met. Among the strategies, coupons redeemable for small gifts at a museum can
track museum visits resulting from Web site exposure.  Feedback forms with both
open-ended and specific questions provide us with important data on the success
of the products, and ongoing dialogue with the heritage community keeps us
on-track vis-&agrave;-vis its  needs.  An assessment by an independent
consultant underlined the strengths of the products and suggested improvements
for usability geared to audience needs.  We are implementing these improvements
on a steady basis.</p>
<p>Success builds on itself - as more museums contribute to the <i>Guide</i>,
the product becomes viable as a marketable item, thereby attracting new
investment by other museums. As professionals contribute to the <i>Forum</i>
and begin using it regularly, interest develops in improving it by providing
content for other professionals to share. Members and contributors invest time
and resources in the <i>Guide</i> and the <i>Forum</i>; the return on their
investment is to be found in reaching the goals of attracting new audiences and
revenues, and enhanced proficiency in one's work.</p>


<h3>Profile:</h3>
<p>Profile means drawing attention to the members and contributors: to the
institutions and individuals who provide the content, and to CHIN as the &quot;gateway&quot;
to the content.  With a heightened profile comes the responsibility for ensuring
the reliability and authenticity of the content in order to lend credibility to
the products. The information has to be kept current and dynamic and it has to
be easily accessible. </p>
<p>Profile is provided by the weekly &quot;Museum of the Week&quot; in the <i>Guide
</i> which highlights one of the member museums in a marquee presentation and an
image. In fact, all participating museums in the <i>Guide</i> are highlighted
by virtue of their becoming part of the collective presence on the Web. In the
<i>Forum</i>, each contributed item is accompanied by a cover sheet which
identifies the contributor and the name of their institution or organization.
</p>
<p>Promotion and marketing are key activities. Given the early stage of
development of the <i>Guide</i> and the <i>Forum</i>, initial focus has been
on promotion within the museum and heritage community in order to attract
participants.  In the past, museum registrars have been most likely to have
access to the Internet and its resources. One current challenge is to promote
the products to the entire institution by making the products meaningful and
relevant to museum educators, librarians, curators, conservators administrators,
marketing, and other staff.  Staff need to be aware of the potential of the
products before they can perceive the benefits of contributing. We believe that
by creating an awareness of the products, simplifying the means of contributing,
and continually improving the products, a valuable resource for the larger
community will result.</p>


<h3>Issues:<br>
Duplication of Effort</h3>

<p>Among the specific challenges that have been encountered has been that of

working in partnership with institutions that are at varying stages of
technological development. CHIN members range from institutions with mature Web
sites, automated collections' management (i.e databases of collections data),
well-developed marketing plans, and strong public identities to small, seasonal
museums staffed by volunteers, using manual collections' management (and some
with no plans for automation), and having strong local identities. </p>
<p>The institution contributes information about itself, its permanent
collections, its services, and its exhibitions to the <i>Guide</i>. For the
computerized institutions, much of the dynamic information we ask to have
included in the <i>Guide</i> is already in place on their Web site and
duplication of effort is an issue. To address this issue, a hybrid system of
centralized and distributed information has been established.  In this interim
solution, museums continue to contribute background information that does not
change rapidly and is likely to be a one-time contribution, while at the same
time, CHIN establishes links to specific museum Web sites.  To allow
comprehensive<b> </b>searches on more changeable information, museums
contribute minimal exhibition information (i.e title, dates) to the <i>Guide
</i>.  Search  results from the CHIN site are then linked to the institution's
Web site that contains the expanded exhibition or event information.  This
interim solution reduces the duplication of effort for museums while permitting
access to the full information for the public.</p>
<p>A long-term solution involves CHIN's work with the consortium for the
Computer Interchange of Museum Information (CIMI) to address the problem of
sequential searching in a distributed rather than a centralized environment such
as the <i>Guide</i>. To date, research and development continues in an effort
to identify a cost-effective and robust means of achieving such a search using
existing tools.</p>
<p>This long term solution presupposes that robots and spiders go out and
search relevant information which is then presented in the <i>Guide</i>.  We
are exploring the tools that are now available for this approach.  To make this
work, we will have to negotiate agreements with institutions, respecting their
copyright and through the means of protocols and reciprocal links ensure we are
informed of new items.  Again, for this to work, it is crucial that institutions
see this as a collaborative not competitive venture.</p>
<p>Museums without automation see the immediate benefit from being part of the
collective Canadian museum presence on the Internet. On their own and with
minimal investment and in some cases with the assistance of their provincial
museum association or regional network of museums, these institutions are able
to participate in this on-line resource.  They have become members of the
virtual community.</p>


<h3>Authenticity:</h3>
<p>Application work was concentrated on procedures for contributing to the <i>Guide
</i> via on-line input forms.  Maintaining currency of information and avoiding
duplication of effort does not allow for a paper input process.  To ensure &quot;authenticity&quot;
user IDs and passwords are issued to members upon CHIN's receipt of signed
membership forms.  This prevents the creation of new &quot;virtual&quot; museums
that exist in the mind of the creator only.  Access to the on-line form from any
community access point (library, school, museum); and the verification of
records before loading them to the <i>Guide</i> is limited to &quot;authorized&quot;
staff via user ID and password.</p>

<p>Contributions to the <i>Forum</i> are moderated by the CHIN project leader

who visits suggested Web sites and reads contributed documents. Initial
mechanisms for contribution (FTP, e-mail, diskette) to the <i>Forum</i> have
tended to discourage potential contributors who are unfamiliar with FTP or who
find the mailing of diskettes time-consuming. CHIN is developing an on-line
contribution form that will provide a consistent format for cover sheet
information which in turn will facilitate the retrieval of data. In the
meantime, contributors are encouraged to send documents in an e-mail message.
</p>


<h3>Future Directions:</h3>

<p>As the heritage community and CHIN grows, we are looking at ways to enhance
our capacity to more accurately define and meet audience needs.  CHIN will
further develop its analysis of audience requirements, in part by focusing on
improvements to user satisfaction issues in our products.  For the <i>Guide
</i>, we will be working with various authorities in the tourist industry in
order to produce a list of defined terms for tourist regions that will give the
audience access to individual destinations.  Our first application provided for
searches by city and province, but not by region.  Now by mapping cities to
tourist regions, audiences will be able to ask questions, for example on the
Niagara Wine District, and they will receive a result set of all the towns,
cities, and heritage institutions in the area.  </p>

<p>The initial target audience, identified above as &quot;cultural consumers,&quot;
seeks comprehensive information on events and exhibitions in the museum and
heritage community.  This same audience is likely to seek information on
performing arts events. CultureNet, an on-line network for the performing arts
(<a href="http://www.culturenet.ca/">http://www.culturenet.ca</a>), offers an array of resources that complement those
provided on the CHIN site.  Thus we are proposing a joint project with
CultureNet to develop the means for the audience to find all the information in
one search.  A first step in this direction is to develop linked searches that
would search the performing arts at the CultureNet site and then link to the
CHIN site for a related search.</p>

<p>Enhancements to the <i>Guide</i> and to the <i>Forum</i> have to reflect
other developments at CHIN.  For the <i>Guide</i>, CHIN is planning the
implementation of links from the institutions to their records in the National
Inventories. The National Inventories have recently been made available, without
subscription fees, for a one-year trial period (1996-97) to gain the audience
feedback needed to improve their interface and functionality.  In the future,
CHIN and the museum community will be working out the means for contributing
records to the National Inventories in the distributed environment.</p>
<p>Images of works in museum collections are important elements in the Web
environment to attract audiences. Given priority and resource issues in the
heritage community, there has been limited investment in digitization projects
for many institutions. CHIN is establishing procedures that will facilitate the
contribution of selected images to the <i>Guide</i>.  We provide glimpses of
the museums' treasures in order to encourage visitors to the actual site while
leaving the presentation of the works well within the control of the individual
institutions. The images and related content are always accessible through links
from the <i>Guide</i>.  However, with different audiences for the<i> Forum
</i>, we will continue to limit the use of images in order to cater to all
levels of technological access and to ensure speedy downloading.</p>
<p>For the <i>Forum</i>, CHIN, in collaboration with the Canadian Museums
Association, will be offering an online job-posting service for the heritage

community.  This partnership extends the reach of the Association, provides
limited revenue to both partners and responds to a demand that CHIN has
experienced in many e-mail messages over the last few months. </p>
<p>The success of the <i>Guide</i>, the <i>Forum</i>, and initiatives leading
to access to the rich holdings of the Canadian heritage community has been and
will continue to be the result of the ability of all partners to work together
to exploit the possibilities afforded by the new technological environment.</p>

<h3>Appendix # 3</h3>
<h3>Time Line and Resources</h3>

<p>The current version of the <i>Guide</i> was developed over a period of
eight months. The <i>Forum </i>was developed over a period of six months. Both
products were launched in July 1996. Personnel involved in the <i>Guide</i>
comprise, for the museum, one-time involvement of one contact person in the
museum responsible for contributing the information, and periodically thereafter
for updates to events and exhibition schedules.  At CHIN, the <i>Guide</i>
calls for the skills of the project leader and the Web manager, the translator,

inhouse and contracted-out programming for the application and the ongoing
support of the Help Desk. For the <i>Forum</i>, the partners are individual
professionals in the heritage community and coordinators of museum studies
programs, while at CHIN, development by the project leader, the Web manager and
systems development staff.</p>
