<h2>Lin Hsin Hsin</h2>
<h1>Building An Ultimate Art Museum on the Web</h1>

<i><b>Keywords:</b> art museum on the Web, 2D Web site, 3D Web site, Web
site design concepts, design elements, navigation and implementation</i>


<h2>1      Introduction</h2>

<p>In real life, an art museum landscapes around a building design concept
with a defined exterior and adjustable interior spaces with a permanent
collection and curated exhibitions. Implementing an art museum on the Web
can either simulate or represent its real world environment or it can be
completely built upon a <i>virtual space.</i><a href="hsin.html#1">1  </a>
Whatever the case, the emptiness of the "<i>not-being-there"</i> is totally
replaced by the all too familiar screen-based fatigue and "clicks" on the
palm-tired mouse-pad on its Web representation. Thus, a good Web design
concept must be considered in order to attract and attain, retain and
maintain visitors with maximum <i>Web Appeal.</i><a href="hsin.html#2">2</a>
Currently, with exceptions, many real world art museums are represented
by a 2D design concept filled with icons and its associated links together
with snippets of its collections. The prime objective of such a digital
brochure is simply offering a vehicle to inform visitors of its physical
presence.<p/.

<p>Using current available technological tools, this paper examines and
presents an art museum design philosophy and concepts. Based on the
author's extensive Web site visualization, design and implementation
experiences, it details design elements in appropriating and apportioning
multimedia contents like exhibits and essays versus the extent of text
annotation, image size, quality and quantity as well as the inclusion of
audio sound bites, music and video clips. As such, it suggests and offers
the determinants for the basis and demand of incorporating fun elements
such as animation for both 2D and 3D Web sites. </p>

<h2>2      Design Concept and Philosophy</h2>

<p>Invariably, there are many approaches in designing an art museum on the
Web. However, depending on the type of real world art museum, its
representation on the Web should reflect its mood as in its type of
collection. Once the museum authorities decide on the kind of viewerships
they want to reach out to or attract, the Museum on the Web can be
implemented accordingly. </p>

<p>Before embarking on the design, one must conceptualize the Museum in
terms of the extent of the size of the Web site and its estimated number of
Web Pages to be built. Depending on the resource availability, the
<i>Webster</i>  then decides on the deployment of the fast changing
Internet technology to create the Web site with maintenance and changing
exhibits in mind. In the case where the Museum has multiple real world
locations, one also needs to decide on the number of sites at this stage.
<a href="hsin.html#3>3  </A>  Based on the above decision and the preference
for 2D or 3D site, the site architecture will be planned, designed and
implemented. I shall highlight the common denominators and address the
design issues for both 2D and 3D sites separately. </P>

<H2>3      Design Considerations</H2>

<H3>3.1   Homepage</H3>

<P>As Homepage is like a museum front door, its first impression could turn
on or off a visitor accordingly, hence the need to pay special attention on
Homepage design. </P>

<P>Just like in a real world museum, a visitor can enter the museum on the
Web via a free entrance  or ticket sale. This is also where the visitor can
sign the museum's guest book, the difference is, on the Web, the Webster
decides whether the guest book will be available for viewing. </P>

<P>A Homepage should excite and inform visitors about all the happenings
within the museum. Thus, it is necessary to display the basic real world
information such as the museum address, phone, fax, e-mail contacts,
opening hours and location map before zooming in its art collection. Other
mandatory Homepage information should include sponsor's name and logo and a
link to museum's board and council members. </P>

<P>In the case where the real world building displays strong architectural
interests, it would be useful to display links to the photographs and
information about the building and its architect. </P>

<P>Homepage should display icons and links to audio-visual museum guide4),
check in the museum auditorium and such like amenities.  <A
HREF="hsin.html#4">4</a> Whatever the added facilities, the objective is to
increase visiting pleasure and not loading pressure. </p>

<p>Whether one is building a Web replica of its real world counterpart or a
Web museum, the museum authorities need to establish and apply for a domain
name and appoint a site Architect or Webster, upon which, he or she must
set directory and file naming conventions. <a href="hsin.html#5">5</a></p>

<p>Be it 2D or 3D site, the site architect needs to know the size of the
site measured by the number of Web pages, that is, the number of
<i>htmls</i> or <i>wrls</i> based on a conceived and suitable page length
or room size. </p>

<h3>3.2   Background</h3>

<p>Whether it is designing Web pages in a 2D or 3D environment, the Webster
begins with a choice of color scheme for the entire Website. While one can
choose different backgrounds for different Web pages, one must maintain the
same look and feel throughout the site, keeping in mind that the objective
of an art museum is to display art and as background of a Web page being
analogous to the museum interior wall, it is best to keep it as subdued.
</p>

<h3>3.3   Image Scanning</h3>

<p>Though design is an art, scanning artworks is a science, attention must
be given to the scanner's color calibration thus ensuring the correct level
of RGB is set before scanning. Depending on the quality of the input:
photos, slides or transparencies, scanned result vary in quality
invariably. However, even if the quality of the original transparency or
slide is excellent, it too can result in poor scanned quality, for pixel
formation depends largely on the sensitivity and medium of that artwork.
Thus, one needs to examine the quality of the image and digitally touch up
the respective image. </p>

<p>However, there may be occasions that the final scanned image is still
not ideal for display. As such, the Webster should advise the museum
curator to exclude the image though it is an important artwork from the
curatorial perspective for reason that the Webspace is the first and direct
contact with the viewer. </p>

<h2>4      2D Sites</h2>

<h3>4.1   Design Elements</h3>

<p>Conventional relationships have long been established between the
artworks and the viewers in a real world museum environment. Such
relationships involve the participation of the audience's spatial movements
between or surround the artworks in the real world space. </p>

<p>However, when such viewing is reduced to a flat defined space as in a 2D
environment, viewers must be stimulated to "<i>click on</i>" since the
artistic merits of these artworks have been diluted to such a scaled-down
"<i>intangible</i>" surface. Hence, viewing in such "<i>Webspace</i>" can
be paralleled to that of a "<i>hypertext luminated art catalog</i>". This
shift in the confined viewing distance are now substituted by digital
images juxtaposed with text, whereby suggesting the importance and
integration of the different design elements. By shedding out the
inhibitions of the <i>text-image</i> based Webspace, the following are the
design elements for a Web Page design: </p>

<h3>4.2   Text</h3>

<p>Like selecting a color scheme, text forms an integral part of a Web
page, hence the need to adopt a font type that reflects the art collections
and exhibits within the museum. Though the font size may vary within a page
and from page to page, font color must be chosen to match and mix with the
background and images. While text should be coded as an ISO 8859-1
(Latin-1) character, it can be also be created as a graphic file to reflect
the meaning of the word, enhancing and complimenting the <i>typesetted</i>
text, nevertheless, this will only be effective when used sparingly. The
Webster should note that captions and labels of the artworks should be
coded in its original European languages. Unlike reading a coffee-table art
book or an art exhibition catalog, text annotation should be kept only as
an accompaniment to images on a Web page with the option of opening up
press releases, bibliography, artists' biodata and essays that are stored
and linked in separate files. </p>

<h3>4.3   Images</h3>

<p>When creating graphic files in jpegs and gifs, it is utmost important
that the Webster considers the optimal size and quality of the image versus
its quantity and system performance. Current HTML 3.2 commands can be used
to create a beveled frame with different colors and thickness for painting
if so desired. Viewing <i>files as artworks</i> causes boredom and fatigue,
hence where appropriate, shadowing an image file can create a different
viewing effect and break monotony. </p>

<h3>4.4   Multimedia Elements</h3>

<p>The inclusion of an audio sound bites or music could liven up the
viewing process only when used as an exception rather than the norm as such
function is to accompany or surprise an artwork. Video clips on interviews
or vernissage can be shown whenever necessary. To make it more exciting,
Webster can consider piping in live Real Audio sound files and/or
<i>See-You-See-Me</i> webcasting for special events. </p>

<p>Multimedia elements are best used with current technology to add fun to
the Webspace. This added dimension can be achieved quite simply by creating
<i>animated Gifs</i> as in <i>Gif89a</i> or using <i>Shockwaves or
Fireworks</i>. One can even make a Web page more sensuous by adding a
simple "<i>MouseOver</i>" command to display text. For more exotic Web
pages, one can use JavaScript to add moving text or write Java
<i>Applets</i>. Whatever the choice, the Webster needs to exercise
filesize control over fun. He or she must also inform viewers of the chosen
technology or plugins for optimal viewing pleasure. </p>

<h3>4.5   Web Page Layout</h3>

<p>Every Web page should be titled to reflect the museum name and annotates
the contents of the page. As such, it not only serves as a good
documentation for the Web site, it directly informs the viewer on the
present Web location in the wilderness of World Wide Web. </p>

<p>Just like laying out an art catalog, a Web page layout much depends of
the nature of the artwork. Whether one selects a multi-column display, a
frame-based Web page, or a <i>text-surrouding-images</i> or a conservative
centralized text-image display style, one begins with adopting a layout
concept for the site. Since a visitor on the Web is usually directly
looking at only one Web page at a time and assuming that he or she would
normally prefer to view an artwork at a time, the Webster can select
different layout format for different Web pages. Whatever the chosen layout
format, one must avoid <i>Web-page-congestion and overloaded number of font
size </i>at all times. Current available tools allow absolute positioning
and layering. </p>

<h3>4.6   2D Site Navigation</h3>

<p>Navigation is the most obvious or most complex part of building a Web
site. Though it is as obvious as attaching a link on a word like "address"
followed by a click leading you to a desired URL, one needs to adhere to
certain navigational linkage guidelines: </p>

<ul><li>Not to overload links, else it loses its effectiveness.
<li>Links should be strategically placed to invite continuous exploration
          and touring around the museum.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there's no rule governing the optimal number of links on art
collections. Links are based on viewing criteria either set by the curator
and/or the Webster. Commonly set criteria include: viewing by <i>artist,
exhibition theme, medium, period, collection, year, room,</i> depending on
one's set priorities, exhibits can even be viewed by size or by its
collectors. </p>

<p>There are just as many ways to establish links within a Web page and a
Web site. Basically,  links can be attached to an imagemap, an icon or
simply on a text. Links can be accompanied by narratives stored in an audio
or video file. Though one is free to define hotspots on any image type, it
would be more consistent to create a set of icons or imagemaps for every
place of visit within the museum, hence easing off the <i>forward and
backward</i> page traffic. Whatever the case, museum links usually lie
within the museum perimeter, seldom it is connected to any external
entities. </p>

<p>When developing a large Web site, the Webster must validate links to
avoid returning embarrassing <i>404 Not Found error message</i>. Links can
be validated using different methods either by writing a Perl Script or
using WebCopy</I><a href="hsin.html#6">   (6) </a>or any of the commercially
available <i>WebMap </i> <a href="hsin.html#7"> (7) </a>software. In the
case when the update frequency is high, the Webster must make sure to
remove outdated links. Beyond which, providing a search engine within the
site and creating index pages for every directory is almost mandatory.</p>

<h2>5      3D Sites</h2>

<p>With the burgeoning VRML world builder <a href="hsin.html#8> (8)</A>, it
would be real to construct a 3D Web site offering  <I>quasi real space
</I>experiences, walking or even flying from room-to-room and
floor-to-floor to admire pictures from wall-to-wall and artworks on the
floor. In fact, viewing artworks in this manner offers six-plus-one degrees
of freedom, that is, the freedom to move along three directions, rotate
along three orientations and link to another 3D space. If one is more
ambitious one can even build digital escalators and travelators to
transport visitors across exhibits.</P>

<P>A 3D site is best used for displaying installation art or even
<I>interactive installation art </I> as one is able to experience an aerial
view of the artwork besides savoring the <I>non-discrete interpretations
</I> of the artwork simply by <I>mousing around</I>. As such, it would also
be an wonderful experience to chance an orbital view of a mobile, watch
collisions or examine the base of a porcelain vase for example. Other
advantages include the ability to add sound bites mapped into a location
for continuous listening pleasure or a planned guided tour. </P>

<P>However, building a 3D site encompasses even more design elements
besides the abovementioned 2D graphics concerns. As such, one needs a
well-experienced 3D graphics Webster who can design, animate as well as
understanding 3D graphics properties and perspectives.   </P>

<H3>5.1   Editors, Libraries and Object Modeling Tools</H3>

<P>A 3D Webster must avail himself or herself with a set of editors and
libraries for full-environment, rooms, walls, objects, texture, material
and lighting control besides creating 2D and 3D text. As objects (<I>e.g.
tables, chairs, planters</I>) are usually present in a 3D site, one must be
equipped with good object modeling and optimization tools. This include
vertex and face edit, sculpt surface and spline point edit, extrusion and
Boolean modeling, level of detail and eye-range control, texture inline
encoding, geometry optimization,  direct lighting control and explicit
instantiation.</P>

<H3>5.2   Design Elements</H3>

<P>Constructing a 3D site basically consists of three parts: virtual space
modeling, object modeling and scene construction. While one needs to
negotiate a balance between environment size and objects, one needs to plan
for anchor node, entrances and central spaces. Besides gradient and
textured mapped scenes and backgrounds, one is concerned about the
different elevations of objects (artworks) and the juxtaposition of the
display of a 2D painting or wall reliefs with 3D sculptures.</P>

<H3>5.3   Material Properties</H3>

<P>In a 3D Web site, one has the luxury of changing both interior and
exterior wall colors, floor material and pattern. Besides creating the
conceivable regular-shaped room, one has the opportunity to create
odd-shaped room. </P>

<P>While it is possible to replicate the Louvre to its last detail, or fun
to texture map, the Webster must exercise restrain to differentiate the
essentials versus frills, resource optimizations for better performances.
Important feature considerations include: material binding, assigning
multiples, effects on lighting, inheritance and object shapes. </P>

<P>Though it might be fun just to dazzle up the wall, like creating an
animated wall-paper, the Webster must remember that this is a museum, its
objective is to display art and not wall. The basic principle is to keep
the room simple, understand the magnitude of values of RGB and the meaning
of the brightness of color. One possibility is to keep to just diffuse
colors and avoid using emissive color unless one requires fluorescence
effects. </P>

<H3>5.4   Lighting</H3>

<P>Unlike in the real world, an art museum on the Web is free of
<I>lux-level</I> concerns. There's absolutely no fear of under or over
luminating an artwork thereby causing possible damages on the physical
artwork. In such a 3D environment, one can adjust the lighting to suit the
display, viewing distance and room ambience. Current 3D graphics allows one
to choose from an array of lighting conditions that range from <I>point</I>
to <I>directional</I>, from <I>ambient  </I>to <I>diffuse lights </I> and
<I>reflections. </I> </P>

<P>One can vary the complexity of a model according to the distance between
the painting and the viewer by varying the <I>Level of Detail</I> (LOD)
nodes. In addition, it is possible to combine LOD with different lighting
so as to reduce rendering times, LOD nodes Pre-liting sites and compute
radiosity. </P>

<H3>5.5   Navigational Nodes</H3>

<P>In a 3D world, there are two kinds of nodes: <I>WWWInline</I> and
<I>WWWanchor </I>nodes. Basically one uses <I>WWWanchor</I> nodes for
room-to-room connectivity within the museum, and <I>WWWInline</I> nodes for
storing objects in separate files and reuse them in other environments.
This is often applied applicable to a museum with multiple sites. </P>

<H3>5.6   VRML Browser</H3>

<P>Unlike in the 2D environment where the choice is narrowed down to two
major browsers <A HREF="hsin.html#9"> (9) </a>, there is an array of  3D
browsers<a href="hsin.html#10"> (10) </a> to choose from. However, it is
necessary to recognize the chemistry between the 3D world builder and the
3D browser for the visual quality on screen can differ drastically. In the
extreme case, files may not load and system may even crash. </p>

<p>Browser selection criteria include: background color setting,
navigational and mouse control, headlight on/off and dimmer control,
animated path between cameras, motion speed, sensitivity and blur control.
Other factors such as point cloud, wireframe, shading, transparency,
texture mapping suppression and the support for GZIP files are just as
important. </p>

<h2>6      Museum Security</h2>

<p>As the World Wide Web is a place where saints and crooks cohabit,
besides alerting visitors with copyright statements, it is almost mandatory
that artworks must be digitally watermarked and authenticated, museum being
digitally fenced with digital guard and alarm systems. The Webster must be
able to trap and track visitors for statistical purposes and combating
petty thefts and digital break-ins. Whether one implements a
<i>password-control</i> system for museum access or uses commercially
available software to design and implement the Web site, it is the
protection of the Museum and the detection of the digital clones and
uplifts that matter. </p>

<h2>7      Museum Intranet</h2>

<p>As digital archiving is the best form of building an artwork database
besides its valued controlled humidity. It is of considerable interests
that the Webster considers building a museum intranet while building a Web
site for Internet. Ultimately, a well-cited museum is also one that
provides and analyzes visitor's psychology on the Web, accounts for art
inventory besides managing exhibits on the Web or negotiating for more
essays by art critics to be included. The museum authorities can also
consider more intensive business interests like transacting gift items or
even conducting paid demos, workshops and talks over the Net. However, such
implementation will much depend on the visitors' behavior, site popularity
and technological readiness. </p>

<h2>8      Web Museum</h2>

<p>Unlike building a real world replica on the Web, building a virtual
museum is not limited to the real world constraints such as the number of
rooms within the museum, choice of exhibits, the sequence of display and
the number of selected artworks. In this case, the Webster can exercise his
or her interests according to his likes and dislikes. </p>

<h2>9      Conclusions</h2>

<p>Defining a Webspace for an art museum is the most supreme form of
combining aesthetics and technology. The decision of building a 2D or 3D
Web site will much depend on the availability of the museum's technological
resources and the Webster's sense of aesthetics. Though not binding,
besides providing rich contents, these two factors play key role on color
scheme, material properties, lighting conditions, ambience and display
management that subsequently translates into visiting experiences. Just
like an architect in the real world, a successful Webster must be able to
distinguish the desire to boost the designer's ego versus the importance of
design considerations as well as exploiting the <i>up-to-the-minute</i>
Internet technology. </p>

<p>It does not matter whether how the museum is being metaphored, it is
utmost important that the Webster conceives and creates a
<b><i>uniquely</b></I> designed museum. It absolutely does not make sense
if one is creating yet another museum on the Web. Though virtual, the Web
is a living thing, and it must be able to attract and maintain a steady
stream of visitors while implementing the <i>bullet-proof </i>security
measure to protect the museum's assets. Though it is often enough that an
art museum only communicates within its own perimeter, it would be ideal if
the museum is willing to generate online discussions in the form of
hypermail. As this would benefit artists and visitors in creating an even
wider art awareness. Beyond which, it is most important that practising
artists in this global digital village must be able to reach out to the
museum authorities via e-mail, regardless of his or her operating system
platforms and transmission protocols. As such, the need to respond to
e-mail are even more crucial, otherwise any Museum on the Web will become
just an unilateral Web experience and loses the meaning of its Web
presence. </p>
