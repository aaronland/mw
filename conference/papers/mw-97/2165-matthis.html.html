<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>



<p>This researcher reviewed software review publications checked for indicators

of character representation by gender and ethnicity, and cultural assumptions

of logic in educational math software for children.  These indicators were

chosen as major manifestations of a software designer's narrative in
software.

The research supports the theoretical frame that knowing the author is
important
in selecting software for social construction and cognitive development; and

that only one review publication checked for these indicators, which were
buried

in the overall rating.  If these indicators of author narrative exist, they

are not identified because the review mechanism does search for these
indicators.
</p>




<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>



<p>Books, music, literature, television, and motion pictures -- virtually

every form of media has an author<a href=matthis.html#1>1</a> who shapes the
narrative<a href=matthis.html#2>2</a> of the story.

Software programs are no exception.  Like narratives in other media,
narratives

found in software programs shape a person's experiences.  Yet unlike other

narrative forms, the author of software programs often goes unknown.  When we

look at the software box, the manufacturer of the product is listed, but
rarely

the author.  Recently, a handful of software programs has started to identify

the author.  David Macaulay's The Way Things Work, based on his original book,

identifies the single author although a team of developers created the
software.

Other programs, such as Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego?, do not list an

author but members of the software team.  Listing a team is similarly done in

film, where the director has a crew that produces the film but</p>



	<blockquote>". . no. . .film has ever been made without the vision

	and unifying intelligence of a single mind to create

	and control the whole film.  Just as there is only one

	poet per pen, one painter per canvas, there can only be

	one creator of a movie" (Mast, 1991).</blockquote>



<p>For this reason too, there is a single creative vision in each software
program.

Whether the creator's vision is that of a single person or a team, the authors

who are providing the narratives to the software are rarely identified.</p>





<h2>WHY THE AUTHOR'S NARRATIVE IS IMPORTANT</h2>		



<p>The identification of the software author and narrative is of crucial

importance to teachers and parents in understanding their impact on children's

social and cognitive development.  In software, the narrative defines and

controls the child's actions.  The child is presented with or guided into

possible actions in the software program.  It is implied that there are no

limitations to the direction one can take, however, actually, in software, the

possible actions are very "narrow and circumscribed, and -- what is even more

important for the child -- it is defined by the game developer and the

manufacturer instead of by the child" (Provenzo, 1991, 1994).</p>



<p>An example of action circumscription occurs in the software program

SimCity, a city development simulation game, where the child creates and

develops a city.<a href=matthis.html#3>3</a>The child is guided in making
decisions by the software's

"rules for city development,"<a href=matthis.html#4>4</a> that provides
detailed reasoning for what

the child, as city developer, can and cannot do, presumably imitating
real-life.

The illusion of a real city development simulation is shattered when,
paying for

taxes, the algorithm or basis for calculation for the tax bill is not
provided.

Taxes are a primary concern in capitalist development but the software author

did not find it necessary to provide this lesson.  Who was the author?  What

is the author's background?  How was it decided that this lesson of city

development is not provided? Is this is a case of author oversight?  Did the

author deem the information not necessary to know?  How would this narrative

differ if the author was H & R Block, Nintendo, or Scholastic?<a
href=matthis.html#5>5</a></p>







<p>Regardless of the reason, the narrative result is: You don't need to

understand the tax calculations -- pay the tax or you can't continue.  This

omission is significant in terms of narrative because the game's social

construction is narrowly and, in this case, negatively circumscribed by the

author, the software designer, by the withholding of important rules that
provide

learning and understanding of city development -- which is the purpose of the

game.  The player must adhere to the limits of the game, assume the narratives

as provided by the game, and absolutely follow the rules of the game -- or she

or he can't play.</p>



<p>The omission of information illustrated by SimCity is of concern in

education software where social construction as well as cognitive instruction

is provided to the child by the software.  In addition, ethnic and gender

representation of characters, and cultural, ideological and philosophical

assumptions in the design can occur in software programs that otherwise
provide

strong education instruction and cognitive challenges.  These implicit and

explicit design decisions on the part of the author may have an impact on how

children see themselves and the world.</p>





<h2>THE FRAMEWORK</h2>



<p>One of Erikson's classic analysis of play seems relevant to the analysis

of software use by children.  Software is used by children to construct a
social

reality "...namely to use objects endowed with special and symbolic
meaning for

the representation of an imagined scene in a circumscribed sphere" (Erikson,

1950, 1975, 1977).  Software developers take this ability of construction
several

steps further by redefining communication, knowledge, and vocabularies
(Provenzo,

1991).  They do this first, by mediating the child's understanding of culture

through the software by selecting what is amplified and what is reduced
(Bowers,

1988).  Provenzo (1991) carried out an analysis of features that appear in

children's software.  For example, the top ten game software programs have

identical major themes: rescue, revenge, and good versus evil.  Other options

are reduced, or are not provided or selectable by the child.  The child is

"directed by the content of the games to construct a social reality based
on the

games" (Provenzo, 1991).   These choices by the software developers
prevent the

child from constructing his or her own reality, and the child is in
relationship

with the game.  When using software, children may be required to adopt the
voice

of the software author in order to participate.  When using software, children

may be required to relinquish their voices for the voice of the software's
author,

assume the software's social construction, give up all options that come with

making a choice, and relate to the software that is choosing on their
behalf.</p>



<p>The "voice" of the author can appear in the software's design in many ways,

but the two simplest to identify are in the interface -- the images on the
screen.

The first is the representation of the characters as boys or girls and as
different

ethnic identities, and second is the assumptions made about the culture
the child

is from or is familiar with through the words, actions, and pictures of
places and

things (logic and organization) in the software.  Literature exists that can

identify gender and ethnic representations and cultural assumptions of
logic and

organization: software reviews.</p>









<h2>LITERATURE REVIEW AND  METHODOLOGY</h2>

 	

<p>I investigated how gender, ethnicity and cultural assumptions are represented

in children's software by examine which features got attention and which
were ignored

or "assumed" by conducting an analysis of the software reviews, and
reading theoretical

sources.  The software reviews were published in periodicals, journals,
and books.</p>

 		

<p>I examined a maximum of three review publications of children's software.

There were two criteria for selecting reviewers.  First, the publications'
primary

purpose is the review of software.  This includes technical, professional and

teacher education review journals, and excludes reviewer segments for
daily newspapers

and weekly periodicals.  The reviewers must at least include teachers and
software

specialists, to bring experience from the teaching and software development

professions, and can provide expert opinions on narrative and pedagogy.
Second,

reviewers are not affiliated with, take advertising from, or are otherwise

accountable to software publishers and manufacturers, to discourage bias.</p>



<p>There are thousands of software titles and many genres, therefore, the

criteria for selecting the software reviewed was narrowed to include the
"top ten"

titles of mathematics genre6 software sold to schools by ESR, which
distributes

education software to over 33% of the school market.  The software titles
are designed

for grade groups K-4 and 5-9.	</p>



	





<h2>FINDINGS AND IMPLICATIONS</h2>



<h3>The Interim Findings</h3>



<p>Only one software reviewer specifically developed and published its

review criteria, and that criteria had two inquiries for gender and ethnicity

content.  However, these evaluations were lost when tallied into the review's

overall rating.  Outside this exception, software reviews do not evaluate for

these indicators of the author's narrative.</p>



<p>Further research is being implemented to determine if reviewers would

re-evaluate the software, adding gender, ethnicity, and cultural assumptions of

logic criteria to their evaluation lists.  Based on this added criteria,

they will be asked if their software programs' previous ratings would change,

and if they feel such criteria are deemed necessary.</p>


<p>Educators and developers of educational materials regardless of the

medium must have an understanding of the narrative provided by the authors

of that medium, develop criteria with which to evaluate the strengths and

weaknesses of the learning provided, and select or develop a review model

they can use to develop an evaluative tool.  The risk is creating educational

software with that, even with the best intentions, fails to teach effectively

because the biases are barriers to learning.</p>
