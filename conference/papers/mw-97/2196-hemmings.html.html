Abstract

</h3>



<p>

The Museum is a perspicuous site

for analysing the complex interplay between social, organisational,

cultural and political factors which have relevance to the design

and use of 'virtual' technologies. Specifically, the

introduction of virtual technologies in museums runs up against

the issue of the situated character of information use. Across

a number of disciplines (anthropology, sociology, psychology,

cognitive science) there is growing recognition of the 'situatedness'

of knowledge and its importance for the design and use of technology.

This awareness is fostered by the fact that technological developments

are often associated with disappointing gains for users. The effective

use of technology relies on the degree to which it can be embedded

in or congruent with the 'local' practices of museum

users. Drawing upon field research in two museums of science and

technology, both of which are in the process of introducing virtual

technologies and exploring the possibilities of on-line access,

findings are presented which suggest that the success of such

developments will depend on the extent to which they are informed

by detailed understanding of practice- practices that are essentially

socially constituted in the activities of museum visitors and

museum professionals.





<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p>

<i>

The New Museology  

</i>

recommends

that the study of museums and professional work within museums

should adopt a greater degree of self awareness, inquiring not

just into methods, but into purpose, context and consequence

(Vergo 1989) . When this term was coined in 1989 <a href=#1>1</a> most museologists were blissfully unaware

of the potential  problems and promises generated by Information

and Communication Technologies (ICT's). Museums are  no longer,

if ever they were, innocent pedants engaged in the  collection,

conservation, classification and display of objects. On the contrary,

museum practitioners now recognise they are one among many components

in panoply of  cultural amenities. Add together determinants that

include the external  pressure of political and market forces

with an increasing internal reflexivity and the result is an institution

no longer professionally or intellectually isolated from a commercial

array of cultural and leisure sites <a href="#2">2</a> and no longer certain of

its role or identity  in the explosion of contested identities,

image and meaning (MacDonald and Silverstone, 1996).



<h3>Background</h3>



<p>In many cases the security of

museums will increasingly rely on their position as resource providers

and mediator within various educational infrastructures, including

the World Wide Web. However pedagogists within museums have by

definition always identified their function as being part local

educational landscape. In the UK national science museums  have

a long didactic tradition, providing educational and informational

resources for diverse social constituencies.  It is, however,

only quite recently that funding bodies <a href="#3">3</a> have become keenly aware

of the putative benefits that new technologies might confer upon

museum work.   Many museums are now beginning to utilise more

recent ICT applications, intra and inter organisationally, to

develop database and support curatorial and management networks.

'Designed in', telematics and interactive exhibits are extensively

incorporated into galleries in order to  enhance the user/visitors'

experience. Multimedia applications are also widely used as a

novel way of representing illustrated versions of text and artifact

, and for the time , images, sound and text are now becoming available

and accessible asyncronically through on-line local and global

communication networks.  Theoretically, these information highways

not only extend and increase the  available range and types of

collections but also the visitor/user demographic.</p>





<p>So far, with the exception of

a limited number of European initiatives; similar to the IMIN

the International Museums Information Network  and RAMA, <a href="#4">4</a>

the process has been piecemeal

and ad hoc in character and, while museums are keen to adopt new

technologies, not for the first time can two key phenomena be

observed. First, there is arguably a tendency towards a 'technology

led' approach, whereby the mere existence of new technologies is

deemed to constitute a solution to organisational problems, and

secondly, the rapid and enthusiastic development of new applications

is not always accompanied by rigorous systematic consideration

of the use to which they will be put. The need for a strategic

thought is now being recognised under the heading &igrave;The

Museum and the Web&icirc;. The appeal of such slogans,  is that

they can be used to mean many things to many people. This slogan

does, however, signify a shared sense that ICT's have the

potential to fundamentally reshape the very conception of what

a museum can be. On-line technologies are emerging which, theoretically

at least, have massive implications across the entire range of

museum work; ICT's promise to revolutionise the activities

involved in collections management and user access and inquiry.

Allowing for the associated element of 'hype', which

one has come to expect in relation to such claims (Hemmings et

al, 1996) and the inevitable 'churn factor', there

can be little doubt that elaborating the 'virtual museum'

generates a set of issues which museum professionals and academics

recognise as critical for the future of the museum as a civic

institution. We moot these issues not to question the value of

ICT's but to focus attention on a  host of enduring tensions that

that provide an almost Faustian sub text of problems and promises

which Silverstone (1995) succinctly identified as  "objects

and logics in time and space".</p>



<h3>Problems and Promises.</h3>



<p>Actual museums occupy physical

space; they contain objects and artefacts; the character and circumstances

of individual museums and their collections is often unique; they

allow visitors to wander through an exhibited collection. The

virtual museum provides us with a number of practical and theoretical

issues which we list as the problems and potentials:



<ul>

<li>The potential to transcend various

<i>physical</i> constraints upon museums, including the problem

of the hidden collection its storage and display.



<li>The potential of transcending

time, space and identity and the problems with indexicality and

new forms of mediated interaction. 



<li>The problem of organising contextuality

and the promises of displaying new and/or competing narratives

become available. 



<li>The problem of the increasingly

diverse constituencies for which the museum seeks to provide and

the promise of growing audiences. 



<li>The problem of the security

and conservation of artefacts and collections  and the promises

of sophisticated representation.



<li>The problems  of the museum as

media house- publishing, broadcasting requires disciplinary skills

which include- programme selection, commissioning, production,

directing, designing, editing (censorship), site maintenance and

the promise of chance to process and mediate its own products.

</ul>



<p>Set against these hypotheticals,

our study  covers a range of practical issues, including the work

of curators and archivists, designers, marketing personnel, 'educators',

management, intra- and inter- museum relations, and so on. Some,

but not all, of the work we observed was germane to the use of

technology. Where technology was seen as relevant, it was in terms

of some very general considerations of 'potential' in areas where

our colleagues at the two museums were concerned. We concentrate

here on classification work and how it is done by curators and

archivists, largely because it relates very much to problems of

recording and using database information, because the use of database

applications is more advanced in museums than any other kind of

application, and because curatorial practices enable us to make

classification visible as work and at that cooperative work, rather

than as the deployment of pre-existing categories in stable hierarchies.

What we try to do below is present an account of the kinds of

relevant practice that need to be understood as classification

work before we can begin the process of identifying what is 'appropriate' 

computer support.</p>



<h3>Contested Meanings</h3>



<p>If the commercial nexus is one

dimension in which strategic thinking is emblemised by the concept

of the virtual museum, then there are two others of major significance.

The first involves a fundamental rethinking of the cultural role

of the museum in society. Reiterating our introduction, concerning

the fragmentation of meaning and the decentering of social structure

in contemporary society, it is clear that cherished views of the

value and role of the museum as a social institution have come

under intense scrutiny. If the 19th century conception of the

museum was to achieve 'by the ordered display of selected artefacts

a total representation of human reality and history' (Donato,

1979 quoted by Bennett, 1995: 126), wherein 'as educative institutions,

museums function largely as the repositories of the already known.' (ibid:147), contemporary accounts emphasise the multiplicity of

narratives and the contestation of knowledge claims.  This ongoing

intellectual debate, marked by such labels as 'the new museology', is not simply an academic one; it is one which informed museum

professionals are very aware of and to which they contribute,

along with social scientists and others. Consequently, the issues

raised feed back into professional practice in a much more direct

way than is usually the case with such discussions in social science,

informing and transforming ideas about acquisitions policy, exhibition

making, education work and many other aspects of museum life.</p>



<p>The debate centres around the

task of formulating a coherent rationale for the museum in place

of the traditional one of the museum as a repository of fixed,

universal values. Challenges to established discourses, e.g. of

progress or enlightenment, mean that the notion of cultural authority

which the museum traditionally exemplified is being re-examined

in fundamental ways. This process seeks to respond to the displacement

of such absolutist discourses by new and competing social narratives.

Thus the language of change, even crisis, nowadays is being routinely

employed within the professional museum literature. Many professionals

would have sympathy with the remark by Sola (1992) that the truth

is, we do not know any more what a museum institution is. Similarly,

it is only logical to ask the question; do we now or have we ever,

provided a perspicuous account of what constitutes a museum visit

and how  do go about understanding who we are identifying when

we talk of 'the visitor' ?</p>



<h3>Visitor Behaviour: the

social construction of the visitor.</h3>



<p>We referred above to the visitor

and their visit, we argue, by aggregating these these terms nothing

more is constructed than a gloss description for a diversity of

socially organised activities. Furthermore, it is not only museum

artefacts but also visitors who can be conceived as social constructs

and sites of meaning contestation. If it is true, as the discussions

referred to above suggest, that museums are taking up the challenge

to escape from the tyranny of truth telling (Sledge, 1995), and

responding to a recognition that visitors approach their institutions

with a wide variety of expectations and questions and, indeed,

motivations for asking those questions (Mackenzie, 1996), a key

issue is what factors will shape the part to be played by technology

in organising this response. Visitor studies are not new in museum

work, but these studies for the most part constitute attitudinal

surveys of one kind or another. Such studies assume a naive realist

conception of the visitor: visitors are <i>objectified </i>and

viewed as fixed or stereotypical entities. In contrast, we conceive

visitors as sites of contested meaning: who and what a visitor

is, or can be, is constructed <i>interactionally</i> as individual

and group come into contact with museum environments which are

structured in terms of conceptions of the visitor.</p>



<p>Thus, it is not simply that little

work has been done to examine the nuances of visitor behaviour

in the museum, and particularly distinguishing what takes place

when different categories of visitor encounter museum exhibitions.

Even less has visitor research examined the ways in which professionalised

conceptions of visitors inform the structuring of the museum as

a social environment and thus constrain what persons <i>can be

as visitors  </i> the logical corollary  to this way of thinking

is the identity of 'the virtual museum user' is constructed from

the problematic philosophies. We make no assumptions regarding

the visitors/users motives but if the virtual museum is to be

more than simply engaging and user friendly then it must provide

a 'wide number of subjects areas with an infinite number of routes' (MacKenzie, 1996)

that not only 'enable people to think for purposes they have defined

for themselves' (Sledge, 1995) but also provide guidance . Assistance

in the form of specialist  occupational work  enables skilled

practitioners to design exhibits and text in ways that are specifically

pitched qua structured to the users intellectual requirements.

Visible hierarchies is not necessarily 'the dead hand of curatorial

diktat' (MacKenzie, ibid).</p>



<h3>The Diversity of User

Constituencies: we're all users now?</h3>



<p>Furthermore, the commonsense

dichotomy of professionals v. public needs to be deconstructed.

Our early field research was focused on the work of curators,

lay workers and enthusiasts, and on the organised educational

visit. Our interest has been how these different users work with

artefacts and documents, according to the purposes to hand and

that knowledge work is situated action. These interests bear closely

on the virtual provision of text and artefact because they suggest

that the claims surrounding the flexibility of, for instance,

Hypertext media (Landow, 1994) will, if they are to be realised,

demand the same attention to practice as has been given to users

in other social and technological contexts (MacKenzie, 1996).

The logic of this philosophy is that it is the simply our commonsense

abilities that allow us to recognise typical form of activities

that allow us to make  commonsense inferences about the identity

of people wandering round the museum and therefore it is necessary

to distinguish and clearly explicate these forms of situated interactional

practices, that constitute the setting of both real and virtual

museum activity. Understood this way, the dichotomy dissolves

with the effect that we all become users. </p>



<h3>Curatorial Work</h3>



<p>Curatorial work <a href="#5">5</a> is of special

significance in relation to computer technology since collections

management relates very much to issues of recording and using

database information. It is not surprising, therefore, that the

use of database applications is more advanced in museums than

any other kind of application. It is also notable that this work

is co-operative, in the sense in which that term is understood

in the field of CSCW. The museum `collection' constitutes the

central reality and rationale of curatorial work. In their daily

activities, curators work with `the collection' in myriad, socially

shared and socially legitimated ways. The work done includes such

activities as accessioning, whereby artefacts and texts come to

be considered as candidates for inclusion in collections, and

classified as being of a 'kind' within the collection; work involved

in identifying and documenting a collection items, including the

hidden collection of artefacts and texts not on display; and the

work of display/exhibition making.



<p>Again, this work is taking place

in a changing organisational context. Our studies thus far have

revealed a tension between on the one hand an intellectual climate

in contemporary museum life which problematises 'meaning' and

on the other a 'rationalising' tendency which seeks to stabilise

or fix it for organisational purposes. As we have outlined, the

changing status of the museum, and accounts of its 'proper' purpose,

along with the pull of the commercial nexus, have substantially

affected the professional curators sense of the curatorial function

of the museum. (Kopytoff, 1986) In other words, curators perceive

a requirement to be responsive to competing views concerning the

meaning and organisation of knowledge. The characterisation of

curatorial work as interpretation involves acknowledgement of

this requirement. Such concerns open up a difficult analytic terrain

to do with how one might organise and classify artefacts and texts

in more flexible ways.</p>



<h3>Collections</h3>



<p>It is said that the single most

obvious and determining feature of the museum is the presence

of objects and artefacts (Silverstone,1995). There are, however,

similar types of objects in the Mall,  but commonsense tells us

there is a difference. Goods are provided with a particular type

of relevance, they belong in the a class of objects that are readily

saleable and  which we commonly recognise as the kinds of things

sold in kinds of stores. Recognising a class object it seems then,

is on the face of it unproblematic - kinds of objects, in kinds

places at kinds of times, doing kinds of activities . Recognising

an objects or artefacts claim to 'particular' status in 'particular' place- in our case the museum,  rests upon it  embodying characteristics

which are often deemed to include one, some, or all of the following

symbolic properties: uniqueness, significance, representativeness.

Deeming or  judging which objects or artefacts  embody these relevant

properties is a socially sanctioned act that can be carried out

only by only those publicly or officially authorised as competent

and qualified. The question is of course, how is this common understanding

accomplished? We would suggest that our commonsense knowledge

of the world relies upon our understanding the intrinsic and imposed

'domains of relevance' (Schutz,1962). Post-modernists would argue

that these domains are becoming increasingly homogenised. Doug

Makenzie, in a portentious paper presented at EVA '96 warned that

web page design and the attraction of hypertext systems together

with the more conservative curatorial procedures could reinforce

"dogmatic " he recommends that virtual

and physical museums would do well to remember Arthur Danto's

(1992) remark 'that Philip IV did not have his portrait painted

by Velazquez to have it hung with the Spanish School in the Musee

Napoleon. He quotes..."only when the form vanish in which

the King could multiply himself....did these paintings reduce

to works of art in which aesthetics could murmur about diagonals".

Danto continues with the observation that it is "as if the

museum came into existence to celebrate the secondary value of

such objects once their primary value was gone" What we find

interesting here is that Danto recognises that this  transformation

- recasting objects from one class of thing to another, is a purely

social phenomena.</p>



<h3>Technology in Context</h3>



<p>While academic attention has

begun to be focused upon the issues identified above, thus far

such attention has been overwhelmingly from within critical sociologies<i>.

</i>Our study is predicated upon the assumption that the possibilities

of the virtual museum will not be successfully realised without

a detailed and sophisticated understanding of these activities

as <i>practical and socially organised </i>activities. It is also

assumed that adequate understanding of the requirements of the

various stakeholders in the social world of the museum must begin

from an appreciation of the <i>situated</i> character of such

requirements. Sharing the phenomenologists idea of the integrity

of the situation we express it in terms of what Schutz, (1962)

called the "paramount reality of the Lebenswelt", simply put,

the concept of understanding the meaning of a situation or event

is made recognisable contextually as  social setting is constituted

in and through the form social interaction.</p></P>



<p>Across a number of social scientific

disciplines (e.g. Anthropology, Psychology, Sociology, Cognitive

Science), there is growing recognition of the situatedness of

knowledge and of the importance this has for the design and use

of technology (Suchman, 1987; Hughes et al, 1991). This awareness

is fostered by a large and growing literature which documents

the fact that technological developments are all too often associated

with disappointing gains for users (Jirotka and Goguen, 1994).

Consensus is emerging that the effective deployment of technology

relies upon the degree to which it can be thoroughly embedded

in its contexts of use, including the ordinary, practical orientations

and competencies of those who are to work with it. The problem

of understanding what computer systems are for <i>in socially

situated terms</i>, rather than simply in terms of an a-social,

technical perspective, is an enduring one, and must be addressed

if such systems are to be woven into existing social practices

and thus provide for the effective creation of new ways of working.

Virtual technologies, whether or not they represent radical innovation,

and regardless of their potential impact at a societal level,

will be usable or otherwise according to criteria of relevance

determined by situated use. Issues of relevance are at the heart

of multi-user systems, and translate into specific concerns which

have to do with the organisation and use of information. It is

apparent that in a context such as the museum, factors such as

contested meaning on the part of the professional community, differing

organisational roles, including those of educators, curators and

managers, and the particular needs of different categories of

visitor mean that information retrieval is very much a matter

of relevance. Usable technologies should enable disparate users

to interrogate information according to their needs and concerns,

and thus should furnish the user with relevant search strategies

for retrieving information according to what they require from

it. In turn, information must be organised in such a way that

varied strategies can be supported. In part, these strategies

are informed by the <i>classification</i> devices used by information

users. Artefacts and text considered as virtual information resources

do not exist in an undifferentiated mass, to be searched and sorted

more or less randomly, but as resources which are to be interrogated

according to professional and lay categories- categories which

will vary according to purpose.</p>



<h3>Orientation and Methodology</h3>





<p>Classification work, which can

be defined as the ordering of things according to some scheme

of categories, is central both to lay and professional use of

museum information. Of course, at least since Durkheim, classification

has been understood as a social phenomenon as much as a cognitive

one, suggesting that the ways in which individuals carve up reality

cannot be adequately understood without reference to their social

membership. Indeed, his remark that <i>the ideas which correspond

to the diverse elements of language are....collective representations</i>

(1976, p.434) is foundational to much work in the sociology of

knowledge. However, the sociological analysis of classification

is still an open issue. Ethnomethodological approaches, for instance,

have frequently criticised the division it assumes between the

social and the cognitive, and have argued that semiotics, Levi-Straussian

structuralism and the ethnosemantic tradition (e.g. Frake, 1980),

transpose culture from the social realm to the inside of the members

head. Furthermore, the methodology by which this cognitive order

is <i>extracted</i> could be said to leave out the interpreters

work (Eglin, 1976). The point here is that treating classification

as work done is a methodological choice which we believe provides

a useful approach for understanding how information in the virtual

society will <i>in practice</i> be used.



<p>Ethnomethodological studies 

emphasise the <i>practical and contingent</i> character of classification

under real world conditions (Garfinkel, 1967). Our own stance

on these methodological choices is ethnomethodologically informed

and is intended to develop the now substantial literature on ethnography

in the context of systems design, mainly to be found in the interdisciplinary

fields of  Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported

Co-operative Work (CSCW). Such an approach has a number of advantages

in this context.  Firstly, emphasis on the situated nature of

work interactions gives an analytic purchase on the different

ways in which actors can encounter the museum exhibit, locating

their understandings of display in their local and contextual

purposes. Secondly, such studies have a strong and distinctive

evaluative element, relocating evaluation strategies in the real

world of work and organisational context. Thirdly, they can link

with user participative methods, the ethnographer acting as a

bridge between the communities involved and assisting in the articulation

and representation of viewpoints (Twidale et al, 1994). Nevertheless,

a substantial part of this literature  is concerned with circumscribed

locations, and the study of information use in the museum context.





<h3>The Ethnography</h3>



<p>Our analysis is based on an ongoing

two year ethnographic study of the work of museum staff and visitors

in two locations in the North of England; the Museum of Science

and Industry in Manchester (MSI) and the National Railway Museum

in York (NRM), concerned in part with what might be called 'scoping' the problem of information use at the museums in question. That

is, we have been mainly concerned with an attempt to understand

what kind of work is undertaken, and by whom, and how this work

might prove to be relevant to information needs. Our study continues

and we have currently completed about a year of observation. Our

reasons for focussing on the museums in question had to do with

local accessibility and the existence of contacts who could facilitate

entry.



<p>We began to recognise early on

that some features of museum work, for us at least, had been previously

unconsidered. Firstly, each museum has its own biographical history.

By way of example, the origination of the Manchester museum was

as a small scale, almost personal enterprise prompted by the interests

of an individual in the history of engineering. The museum at

that time, therefore was seen as 'his personal project', or, 'run

like a fiefdom.' The fundamental function of the museum then was

perceived as educational, quite specifically as an 'aid to schooling'.

 It grew when offered a railway goods yard and all the artefacts

it contained. The museum then became situated historically at

the location of the world's first railway station, and this informed

the formation of a set of embedded assumptions about 'what was

important'. The original source of funding was the local council,

and this in turn influenced policy- a policy that was essentially

parochial and very much to do with what was perceived as 'locally

relevant'- especially since the 'Manchester' connection determined

things like funding support for acquisition. In a nutshell, the

museum was run by enthusiastic amateurs for whom the evolution

of policy was a question of deciding what it was that they were

enthusiastic about. Policy was, of course, progressive, and management

and curatorship increasingly professional. Nevertheless, this

brief history indicates the way in which we want to understand

policy concerning relevant acquisitions and display decisions-

as being arrived at in the 'doing' of decisions concerning 'what

do we want' and 'what don't we want?'.



<p>Folklore would have it that we

might  assume that curatorial functions were akin to detective

work; happening on clues to the whereabouts of rare and valuable

items, and tracking them down, the reality here was startlingly

different. The most surprising aspect, for us, was the fact that

both museums are confronted with an almost endless supply of artefacts

and materials. Their problem is less to do with how to find exhibits,

but with how to decide what to reject and what to keep, and the

latter greatly exceeds the former. That is, the museums are engaged

in sorting work. This is manifested above all in 'accessioning' and 'de-accessioning', or deciding what should constitute the

'collection'. That is, to an extent, an 'embarrassment de richesse' affects acquisition policy, and available space has a significant

impact on what can be kept and what cannot.<br>





<h3>The local production of order</h3>





<p>Understanding museum work, then,

means seeing it as having a historical character, as the sedimentation

of things that have happened, chronicles of events and significant

developments, and of the roles and consequences of artefacts.

It is constituted in short as the 'ordering' of history. In the

sociology of museums this has been much remarked upon, as outlined

above, generally in terms of the way the order of things, to use

Foucault's formulation is an ideological or discursive construct

(see Bennett, ibid, Macdonald and Fyfe, 1996) and how these are

spaces which have been opened up in the 'post-modern' era for

contestation, for instance by feminist scholars (see Porter, 1996).

Competing views of history, then, inform the work of curators

to a greater degree than ever before, along with the recognition

that their interpretive work is at best 'partial' and incomplete.

Regardless of this rhetoric, however, our interest here is the

way in which the coherence of classificatory schema is arrived

at and maintained, for in the work one of the most striking features

is the way in which agreements at the level of classification

need to be reached before there can be any disagreements about

significance. Even so, classification is above all the work of

making history coherent, of arriving at definitions that are suggestive

of the ways thing relate. Relevancy decisions are made precisely

with an eye to the way things 'fit'- and using those definitions

as 'working hypotheses' or resources for further coherency work.

That is, classification is used to produce order, and is produced

in turn by it. The point here is that these categorisation devices

are the rationale by which curators arrive at mutual understandings

of what it is that they are doing. It is, in short, accounting

work. Such a description may make it appear that inscribing terms

and usages in databases will be no more complex than for any other

set of terms, and so it would be if the coherence we refer to

led to a single usable hierarchy of terms. That is, if usage could

be made 'planful' such that all new objects and texts could be

made to fit an existing thesaurus unproblematically. The problem

is precisely that it cannot easily been done .</p>



<p>Our interest in the way in which

objects are specified as being 'of a certain kind' relies on uncovering

the knowledge and experience which informs the practical, day-to-day,

work  of curators and others. For example, one way in which this

work is made visible is when considering acquisitions and their

cataloguing. Unsurprisingly, museums need to do this. Institutions

of this kind after all would find it difficult to operate without

recorded knowledge of the artefacts they own or control. Nevertheless,

it is more than simply making a list. The inscriptions which are

generated, be it in the catalogues, the cards accompanying displays,

or the fields in databases they use, indicate not just the name

of the object, but its status. That is, the act of examining and

inscribing the object's status is an attribution of 'value'. They

are examples of what Berger and Luckmann term 'typifications' 

(Berger and Luckmann, 1961), but typified according to relevancy

criteria  determined by expert judgement. Deciding 'what kind

of object it is', then, is a matter of providing a brief description

which incorporates judgements concerning issues such as 'provenance',

'uniqueness', and 'relevance to the collection'.</p>



<p>In both the museums we are examining,

objects arrive and leave in a more or less continuous stream as

candidates for inclusion. To reiterate the point, artefacts come

to the museum without an 'authority'. They are merely candidates

for inclusion, and their inclusion confers an authority upon them.

In other words, an authenticity is granted them by virtue of inclusion,

and they stand as 'authentic' to the visitor as a result. Procedures

for 'theming' exhibits within the museum, for deciding what to

display and where, for cataloguing the collection and so on, are

reflexively linked to classification schema. Classification, however,

is an increasingly problematic area. In this respect, the developing

interest in the relationship between image and text (Burgin, 1986a,

1986b) is relevant. Whilst not wishing to engage with the explicitly

political rendering of meaning that Burgin and others are concerned

with, it is clear that serious issues concerning the classification

and 'meaning' of artefacts are raised. Providing 'coherent' and

'relevant' themes is a matter of organising artefacts and text,

not merely representing them.



<p>The limitations of physical spaces

mean that, often, only highly constrained choices are available.

An initial example concerns a large Goss printing machine currently

in the possession of the Manchester museum. We were present at

discussions concerning whether this machine should be de-accessioned,

which in effect means finding another institution that might be

interested in it, or otherwise scrapping it. What is interesting

here is not the machinery, but the rationale that was brought

to the discussion, which included a discussion of 'provenance',

a term covering the history of the machine, the site it came front,

the local relevance of both the site and the machine itself, the

importance of the printing industry to the local area, where it

was made and so on. Points at issue included that the machine

itself was not made in Manchester, but was a major technological

development in the development of the printing trade in Manchester,

that chronicling the history of printing necessitated the ownership

of key machines, but that printing was 'no longer that important' locally. The point here is not that these factors are the most

important in determining the fact of an artefact, but that they

were the most important governing the fate of this artefact. That

is, an account is provided which has to do with changing assumptions

about its value. This whole discussion takes place against another

background, that of available space. The fact of the matter is

that printing machines are very substantial, and retaining it

weighs against the acquisition of other things. In a nutshell,

objects have careers. Hence: database management in museums will

involve careful control over the recording of both what enters

and what leaves the museum, and the collection changes in a more

or less continuous way.



<p>Needless to say, not all artefacts

are large objects. Many are text based, and as it were, come bundled.

The result is that they have to be searched, sorted and identified

in order to establish what their value, if any, is. By examining

one such example of artefacts arriving at MSI, which consisted

of two archives from large electronics companies based locally,

we can identify some of these themes. In the first instance, a

large collection of text based materials was accepted from a company

which had been based in Oldham, a town near to, but not part of,

Manchester. Subsequently, a bigger archive, which included photographs

and detailed historical records, was offered from GEC, a company

based in Trafford Park, a region of Manchester.</p>



<p>Of course, such materials do

not arrive prepared and ordered for museum use. The curators,

in their own words, must 'do a job on it'. Watching them examine

the material, it is clear that the physical nature of the

artefacts in question provides a variety of accessing routines.

Some of the material is flat, some of it consists of photographs

of buildings, machinery and people, some of it is large format

paper, and thus can be unfolded, as with blueprints, etc. Some

of it is sequentially ordered to reflect a development. The practised

eye of the curator can see how this material could in principle

be organised- its potential as a display item or as a 'fileable' resource. 

As the material is accessioned, knowledge is applied

to it-</p>



<p>'oh, this would do for ... look,

photos of Trafford Park ... you can see the development ...'</p>



<p>'GEC is a big international company,

but its got a local history. I mean, GEC is Trafford Park, and

Trafford Park was once the world's biggest industrial centre ...'

<p>'the [other] archive is just

not so interesting ...'

<p>As they are unpacked, the materials

are 'seen' as what they might be. Drawing on the kinds of relevancy

we mention above, the archivist is able to tease out the social,

political and economic relevance of the material, and thus how

it might be ordered for the visitor or the professional interrogator

of such material, in and through the sorting that is going on.

The 'interpretation work' that is taking place is 'doing' work.

It is the physical work of separating material into piles, noting

that some parts of it have a particular relevance, some could

be incorporated into other displays, some have 'exhibition' potential,

and so on. Notably, the criteria being applied centre on the local

relevance of the material, as in 'GEC is a big international company,

but it's got a local history', and on the significance of the

material, as with, 'oh look, photos ... you can see the development

...' and 'Trafford Park was once the world's biggest industrial

centre ...'. In other words, the sorting and classifying of the

material is done with an eye to the story that can be told, and

a story which is in keeping with known-in-common criteria. Curators

evidently 'know what they mean' when they use terms like, 'is

an example of', 'is typical of', 'is a rare example of', 'is of

the school of', is  'the first' or 'last example of' or is 'a

common type of' and such terminologies are reflexively deployed

against, in this instance, background assumptions concerning the

museum's interest in 'local' matters and in 'industry', as well

as 'what we can do with it'. All of these usages, despite their

sometimes contradictory status, might at some time be used as

justifications for retaining or acquiring a particular piece.

The objects present themselves as candidates for inclusion and

are sorted on the basis of what 'is interesting' about them. What

is interesting is determined not only by assumptions about the

object itself, but by the determination of the curator's practised

eye deciding on its 'place' in the collection, a place which is

determined by the status of all the other objects in the collection

and the curator's knowledge of their relationships.



<p>For MSI in particular, the judgements

arrived at are dependent on criteria such as whether it has local

relevance, whether it has significance for the subject area of

the museum, whether it is unique, and the object's provenance. These

matters, it turns out, are important not only for accessioning

but also for de-accessioning. Museums of this kind have any endlessly

changing set of potential exhibits and frequently wish to move

objects elsewhere, or simply dump them. The point here is that

the Accessions catalogue constitutes a brief record of the rationale

for accepting objects or disposing of them. Not least, it seemed

the entering of descriptions in the catalogue gave a status to

the object, a status that is arrived at by discussion and subsequent

agreement among participants. In other words, the work of cataloguing

is the work of defining objects as being of a 'of value' for specified

reasons. What is being recorded, so to speak, are curatorial agreements

concerning the 'value' of potential exhibits. A more complete

picture of the things that decide 'object value' in this work,

we think, would tell us much about appropriate categories for

database organisation.  </p>



<p>On the back of this example,

we can make a number of points about representing the status of

objects, including that it is not a matter of imposing a rigid

classification scheme, but of using existing classifications for

deciding 'what you can do with it.' and it is in this way the

we can begin to see  knowledge work as situated action. In that

classifications deployed are not simply descriptions of the objects

themselves, but emanate from 'seeing' the material as it might

be as part of a gallery, of an existing or potential exhibition

or as a resource for scholars. That is, classifications incorporate

assumptions about the 'value' of objects. Classification schema

are contingent upon relevancy criteria which are not self-evident,

but have to do with evolved policy concerning the museum's 'interests'.

They include, in addition to those aspects we mention above, their

use when applying for budgets,  determining levels of staffing,

space to be allocated, etc. Classification is not fixed but is

contingent on the practised reading of acquisitions, and is remade

reflexively as new acquisitions take their place in the collection.

Classification work provides for matching references looking and

finding and found, in order to name. Naming then inaugurates the

object in preparation for description and measurement and measuring

allows for further comparison- treating each as resembling each

other- infinitely extendible, recording ordering in  categories

provides a method of formally documenting inscriptions.



<p>As any practitioner will know,

museum work is complex. Classifying work does not go on in any

single place, or stage of an object's career, and is not solely

the responsibility of the curator.  Museums employ staff with

various responsibilities, which typically include, for instance,

professional designers employed for exhibition purposes, educational

work of an organised kind, as well as marketing, and administration

functions. In addition, professional staff frequently rely on

networks of enthusiastic amateurs for aspects of their work, as

we shall see. On many occasions, these roles become rather fluid,

and it is difficult in practice to entirely distinguish between

what designers and educators do, and what curators do. There is

no space here to detail all aspects of the work, so we content

ourselves with referring briefly to two others. We do so because

in different ways they demonstrate the contingency of classification,

according to the purposes at hand. Analysis of artefacts and their

allocation to suitable categories takes place then when exhibitions

are put together and when responding to enquiries. The 'in house' 

work of preparing for more permanent exhibition is considerable.

Here, the work is that of selecting relevant exhibits, structuring

them in an orderly and coherent way according to the 'story' they

are trying to tell, and providing a narrative text. Again, the

work of producing the story is invisible to the outsider and is

produced out of discussion and agreement concerning the status

of objects which an exhibition might contain, and how they relate

to each other. However, these relations are contingent on the

exhibition in question. It is, one might say, deemed 'like this' for 'this purpose'

 although it might quite well be described in

other ways for other purposes. Further, it is not as if the story

to be told comes fully formed. The production of the exhibition

is as much the production of a story as it is the production of

an organised set of artefacts, and they inform each other. The

objects, the accompanying text, and the positioning of the object

vis a vis others together tell the desired story.</p>



<p>Electronic catalogues of objects,

then, may require organisation with exactly the same attention

to what stories are to be told. Classification schema sometimes

imply a concern for narrative and in our view, inadequate attention

has hitherto been paid to how various stories can be woven together,

and more importantly what we wish them to be, when electronic

media are being used.</p>



<p>Other relevant classification

work can be seen in response to enquiries, typically by telephone

or in person. Indeed, in the museums in question, this fact is

recognised and institutionalised through rota systems for dealing

with them. Although many of these enquiries were of a routine

nature, some were not. There is, for instance, the occasional

request from the media to provide information of a more in-depth

kind than one would expect from a typical member of the public.

Our point here is that answering enquiries can be far more than

merely giving an answer to a self- evident question. In such situations,

responding to an enquiry can be a process of identifying exactly

what it is the enquiry is about, and can involve identifying,

finding, and preparing, the 'local expert' to answer the enquiry

in question. The social distribution of knowledge and expertise

is a common feature of organisational life, and we have seen elsewhere

(for instance in studies we have been involved in the financial

sector) that asking and answering questions, whether it be from

customers or colleagues, is a frequent and surprisingly complex

activity. The point here is that 'answering enquiries' sometimes

involves making sense of 'what kind of enquiry it is', a task

human beings are well suited to. 'Understanding the question' and 

'Finding the person who knows the answer' relies on 'what

the respondent knows' as part of his or her professional expertise.

Embedding this expertise into systems intended to answer the questions

visitors or staff may have is anything but a simple exercise.

It relates directly to the problem of database interrogation and

certainly involves more than the 'Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)'

framework commonly found on the Internet. The point here is that

classification schema embedded in computer databases do not necessarily

pay due regard to the fact that relevant classification is contingent

upon the task in hand. Museum databases should be flexible enough

to be retrievable in such a way that other roles are supported,

not merely that of the curator.



<p>Our argument, then, is that classification

work involves the production of a 'sense of order' out of the

myriad artefacts and texts available. Despite the recognition

that historical interpretation is a contingent matter, there is

not, and has not been to our knowledge, any serious suggestion

that museums could get by without managing objects into 'orderly'

collections. The 'sense of order', in other words must precede

any subsequent disagreements about its partiality, and we need

to understand more fully how it is arrived at, if we are to successfully

evaluate the possibility of developing standardised usages. The

following example which came to our attention took place over

a period of time at the NRM, and involved the senior curator in

the engineering department of the museum and a network of enthusiasts

as they evolved a suitable classification scheme for a particular

kind of railway truck. The background to this is that for the

visitor to the NRM, steam trains are redolent of many things.

They evoke, for many, a 'romantic' past. Steam engines, it seems

are 'of interest', and the museum can trade on a number of assumptions

about the public's enthusiasm for their history, including the

apparent attraction of 'steam', science and engineering issues,

political and cultural background, etc. Not least, they have a

large and impressive physical presence. Notably, however, this

enthusiasm for the engine on the part of the public is not accompanied

by any enthusiasm for the rolling stock. 'Wagons', as aficionados

term them, have other characteristics, which seem to make them

less interesting to the public, including that they are exceedingly

common, they are not easily distinguished one from another by

the unpracticed eye, they are not 'nice to look at', and so on.

Nevertheless, for the railway expert there is a considerable interest.

A number of historical developments meant that certain wagons

were manufactured to do certain jobs in certain locations. For

instance, wagons specifically designed to transport clay from

Cornwall to centres of paper finishing in the North of England, were

built as the rail network developed to allow large scale transportation.

This, it seems, involved a number of problems, including the fact

that the existence of private regional companies meant different

sized gauges had to be contended with. Such matters, however obscure

to the rest of us, are interesting to the curator. In terms of

classification, an operational scheme existed for indexing these

wagons according to what is known as a TOPS number. Such a scheme,

however, is of no value to the curator since the index is operationally

defined, meaning that it distinguishes only by criteria such as

axle weight and payload. Operationally, TOPS allowed one to determine

whether one set of wagons could  be connected to another, and

what engine could tow it. Marshalling was dependent on this scheme.

The TOPS number is of no value for curatorial purposes, precisely

because the historical significance of the object is not equivalent

to its operational significance. The object has changed. At the

NRM, the group in question had determined that the historical

part played by the wagon in the development of the railway had

been somewhat under-researched, had if you will something of a

'Cinderella' status, and set out to catalogue and classify all

existing wagons of a particular kind. The classification issues

here turned out to be markedly different from those implicit in

their operational value, and were evolved as part and parcel of

the work of recording their existence. In brief, it was decided

that the network of enthusiasts would 'spot' these wagons in much

the same way that trains are 'spotted', but that in so doing they

would record certain relevant details, most notably where the

wagon was to be located, the condition it was in, and so on. Each

agreed that when embarking on this exercise they would photograph

the artefact in question, and record the relevant details in notebooks.

This candidate classification scheme had to do with 'provenance'

in museum usage, carried and organised in and through a small

group's discussions of what needs to be recorded so that the recording

could be done at all.  It was evolved through the 'taken for granted'

background knowledge about typical classification devices that

enthusiasts and curators share. The point is that, as with all

classifications, the terms used need to be consistent if they

are to be recorded for comparison work, so categories such as

'rotting', 'wheels on or off', 'coal', 'clay', 'manufacturer',

etc. were agreed on. That is, and in the first instance, some

'broad brush' classification enabled the work of 'collecting'

data to take place. We might refer to these, in Berger and Luckmann's

terms, as typifications, or as candidate classifications, in that

they will 'do' for the purposes in hand. They are socially organised

agreements.



<p>As information began to amass,

the problem became one of organising it into an orderly record.

The brief details were, therefore, brought back and put into an

A4 ring binder. Entries were placed in the binder chronologically

in order of. Using this binder all the time, and getting used

to 'where things are' in the binder allowed the group to do comparison

work, such that using the record as a pre-classified resource

allows members of the group to compare discoveries with existing

finds, and thereby to generate their own knowledge of the 'state

of play'. As their endeavours grew, so it became evident that

a more effective recording system was required, largely because

the work itself had produced a greater sense of its importance.

That is, in the words of the senior curator, "its important

work ... we can't keep all these wagons, and many of them are

deteriorating ... its the only record we have of a part of Britain's

industrial and transport history." It was thus decided that

the information be transferred to an electronic database, purchased

'off the shelf' for its customisability (called ACCESS). A set

of criteria were worked out, which were: TOPS; geographical location;

the owner; date of manufacturer and the who manufacturer was;

a photograph. On top of this, a scale of 1 to 5 is used to record

condition (status) and the criteria became fields inscribed in

the ACCESS system. The scale, along with the other fields, was

agreed beforehand on the grounds that it was a 'good' method.

'Good' here, consistent with Garfinkel's findings (ibid), meant

simply that members arrived at agreements with a degree of consistency.

A text box in the system also allowed the group to record biography,

special details, whether the wagon is rare or typical, is worth

buying or not etc. The data, both in the ring binder and in the

system, was then available for interrogation, and thus to interpretation.

Thus the curator was able to show us an example and say, 'this

wagon is a fine example of a particular type of clay wagon ...

it was used in 1947, and played a particularly important part

in the development of the paper finishing trade.'  One feature

of this ongoing work was that it implicated two distinct kinds

of classification work. The first is what Coulter (1991) has referred

to as taxonomic work, which involves laying down the terms by

which artefacts can be organised in the first place. The second,

however, lies in the special qualities of individual items or

their 'uniqueness'.</p>



<p>Taxonomic work and 'uniqueness' work are distinguishable, and both 

need to be supported in museum

databases. For the most part, this system of coding and incorporating

information into a small database worked well. Problems arose,

however, as the network of people involved began to expand and

we were able to observe first hand some of the consequences when

being shown the system. Here, the reliability of members' terms

came into question, as the terminology used when new 'spots' were

input into the database became increasingly variable. Particular

confusions arose over the status of one variety of motorised wagon,

termed a 'Mogo'. It seems there are a number of different kinds

of Mogo, identified by weight, for instance the  8 and 12 ton

versions. As the curator showed us how he used the system, he

said,



<p>"I'll bring up Mogo, cos

I know there are two of them. I can use search criteria like these

... oh, there are five. Hang on, I'll try again. There you are,

those two ... I can't see why I got five the first time. It's

to do with the order you search in, but I didn't know there were

five of them."</p>



<p>Of course, problems of search

ordering are well known, but that is not the point here. What

had happened was that different people had made assumptions about

the appropriate terminology and reached different conclusions.

Thus, 'spots' had been entered variously as '12 ton Mogo' or 'Mogo

12 ton'. Some entries of 'Mogo' had been capitalised, others entered

in lower case. Members had taken for granted their knowledge of

Mogos and assumed that the database was configured in that respect,

whereas it had been configured according to the senior curator's

categories alone. There followed a lengthy and animated discussion

which we will call a 'what's in a name?' discussion and which

we need not detail. Arguing about a name, however, was indicative

of the need to identify fields in such a way that they both incorporate

and exclude in ways that are in common with members' categories.

This lays out a potential problem for the enlargement of use,

in that standardisation, however desirable, may require us to

be sensitive to the changing user population, and variations in

the common-sense categories they deploy. General conclusions we

might reach from this example include:



<p>Classification schema evolve

in the course of the job of work in hand. The 'value' of artefacts

can become decided through the deployment of recorded data, but

equally determinations of value produce new versions of the classification

scheme.



<p>The effectiveness of classification

schema depends on the 'authority' of those involved in producing

it. Users have considerable difficulty in inputting and interrogating

information where any number of potential descriptions could be

appropriate, and where the user population evolves.



<p>The database might support not

only the collection but a general  history of relevant objects.

<br>





<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>'Evaluative' ethnographies (Hughes

et al, 1994) have in the main been used to demonstrate specific

ways in which technologies have failed to 'fit with' work practice,

and on occasion to reveal how 'work arounds' can obscure problems

with the technology. More generally, it has been suggested that

their task is to deal with 'uncertainty' (see Twidale et al, 1994;

Randall et al, 1995) Our task is not to be overly critical about

existing systems, for in Europe at least the history of database

applications for museum work is a history for the most part of

adapting existing software to support some fairly standard functions.

Indeed, large parts of museum work currently involve no use of

computer technology at all. That it should be so, as we have suggested,

is arguably because the naivety of museum staff has made the elicitation

of 'requirements' a difficult task, and therefore the prospective

success of computer systems in museum work deeply uncertain. 

Our purposes here lie in the evaluation of database technologies

in a rather different sense. We are not concerned with the 'failure'

of particular systems, for our impression is that systems in use

are hardly of the most advanced kind. The evaluation, if that

is what it in fact is, concerns a set of organisational and work-

related issues which provide some initial scope for understanding

the notion of a 'sense of order', and how deconstructing the term

might help us reduce the level of uncertainty contained in database

use. That sense of order, we suggest, is arrived at in a series

of contingent ways which are reliant on work done cooperatively,

sometimes in small and fairly coherent groups, sometimes across

the boundaries of responsibility, and sometimes by virtue of the

way in which general assumptions about purpose are organised.

</p>



<p>In a climate where museums are

under an ever increasing commercial pressure, and where once secure

roles are becoming challenged, the task is more to do with applying

our study of work practices to the general problem of ordering

and classifying the myriad objects which museums keep in their

collections, objects which can include artefacts, texts, images,

whole archives, and so on. What we do want to do is suggest some

of the subtlety of classification work in such a way that the

next generation of systems might support work as it is practically

accomplished, work that for the most part has remained 'seen but

unnoticed', in Garfinkel's terms (1984) to the procurers of existing

systems. Of course, Garfinkel raised the issue of classifying

in terms of 'common sense choices' in his analysis of the documentary

method (ibid), and we want to see classification in the museum

context in much the same way. Classification, when considered

as a job of work, can be seen as orienting to, and  contingent

upon, a number of factors which have to do with the way objects

and texts come to attention, by whom, what the local relevancies

of the museum are, the research interests of curators, and the

prospect and desirability of display. All of these factors may

impact on what classification is deemed appropriate, and lead

to the conclusion that artefacts may in principle be classified

in any number of ways. Indeed, as we have seen, they frequently

are. The contingent status of artefacts, the invisibility of rationale,

the 'work done', have direct corollaries in design terms. We have

suggested a range of issues that seem germane to the general problem,

including the consideration of objects and collections as 'careers' 

and thus change, how classifications emanate from 'seeing' artefacts

in terms of their value in the collection, how they are impacted

upon by a series of local relevances, how it is dependent on the

practised reading of acquisitions, relate to narrative possibilities,

depend on the 'job in hand', and on the 'authority' of the user.

The comprehensive electronic organisation of data about museum

artefacts would be greatly enhanced by the prospect of parallel

classification schema, search pathways, and sophisticated database

interrogation techniques which would allow the contingent uses

we have outlined above. Those with a more cynical view of sociological

input into system design will not be surprised to hear that we

proffer no solutions. The point here is to raise initial questions

concerning how working with database systems might allow, rather

than obstruct, contingent classification. The task here, as we

construed it, was simply to do the ethnographic work, evaluate

the work of museum staff both in their use of technology and without

it, and understand how in practice they 'managed' their collections.





<p>In this paper, we have sought

to raise some initial issues concerning the use to which potential

electronic resources for collection management may be put, based

on the observations we have undertaken. We hope, as the work unfolds,

to begin to specify how they may be dealt with through a more

detailed and thorough description of classification procedures,

visitor behaviour, and educational work. We have not raised at

all the problem of relating professional use to visitor needs,

and believe that if any of these possible benefits are to be realised,

a substantially more nuanced view of the work of museum staff

and visitors is needed.  After all, the objects and their inscriptions

are not merely examples of the past but are instructions as to

'how to tell about the past'. In a sense, a special, respected,

experienced, entrusted authority, resides in the museum, whereby

a tacit contract exists between the museum and the audience. The

issue of providing appropriate 'pathways' through complex and

changing information resources, we suggest, is central to this. 

If such technology were to incorporate visitor uses as well,

then the relationship between professional contingencies and the

degree to which they match or otherwise the assumptions and practices

of visitors will required.</p>
