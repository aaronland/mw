<h2>Building Integrated Museum Information Systems: Practical Approaches to Data Organization and Access</h2>
Date of creation: <i>February 10, 1997</i><br>
&#169; Archives &amp; Museum Informatics
<p>
<h3><a name="Abstract"><font size="3">Abstract</font></a></h3>
<p>Ever wish you could put your fingers on all of the information about a specific topic in a museum, regardless of whether it was 
drawn from the objects collection, exhibit catalogues, the library's holdings, prints and slides collection? Or your interest might 
even extend beyond a single department. With computerization and public access projects, museums are increasingly called 
upon to provide information drawn from a great deal of heterogeneous material. The advent of the World Wide Web has placed 
even more pressure on information holders. </p>
<p>Museum information has been gathered and described in disparate forms -- either because of the nature of the material or the 
nature of the data that can be gathered about museum collections. For a variety of reasons -- availability of software, variations 
in standards, the needs of collections -- heterogeneity can be expected to persist and in many cases, it should be encouraged. In 
spite of these variations of form, style, emphasis, and content, in reality museum information takes only a few forms -- text, 
imagery, and occasionally sound. Web publishing enables museums to provide access to this information through innovative 
means, ranging from exhibits created in hypermedia to samplers of collections, to searchable bodies of text that can be queried 
directly by the user, with the potential for obtaining results that closely match the searcher's information needs. Search engines 
that enable querying multiple information sources drawn from diverse formats are changing the nature and the expectations of the 
role of museum information systems. </p>
<p>This paper investigates fundamental approaches to constructing integrated museum information systems. A key element in the 
process of building these systems is the development of a thorough understanding of the data structures and formats within your 
organization. Also critical is the need to determine how data ought to be stored and shaped, and how a museum would like the 
data to be displayed, once it is retrieved. Practical examples are drawn from projects in which the authors have participated, 
including the Oregon Historical Society's Collections Access Project, sponsored by the U. S. Dept. of Education, and the 
Museum Educational Site Licensing Project, sponsored by the Getty Information Institute, and The United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum. An overview is provided of current web and database technology that supports integrated systems 
development, and consideration is given to the ways in which these technologies match existing information access systems. </p>

<h3><a name="Introduction"><font size="3">Introduction</font></a><font size="3"> </font></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">As information managers, museums differ from other kinds of organizations in the way that they accumulate in disparate forms 
and in disparate ways contextual materials that give meaning to the objects that they maintain. A history museum might have 
gathered records about individual objects with the usual descriptions and commentaries, it might at a later date have acquired the 
business papers of the company that made those objects, and a historian might have done research on an industry of which that 
company was a part for an exhibit and filed those papers in a vertical file of topics about the collections. An art museum might 
have sketches and information from sketchbooks and diaries about a painting that was no longer in public view, a file of artist's 
biographies created by students for a university art history class, and a collection of books about the artist and her circle. All of 
these resources - the objects, the research, the documents, and the records themselves - come to be part of the fabric of 
information that gives an object life in a museum. All of these resources shed light on the museum's collections - some more than 
others, some more independently than others - and while not all are of equal significance, none are discarded by the prudent 
museum information manager. This diversity makes managing museum information a more difficult proposition than keeping track 
of the stock of a stationery store or tracking overnight express deliveries or even developing a profile of a consumer's spending 
habits. The sources of material that museums draw on need not be congruent or even conceived as being related.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">In most museums, the written information that describes collections takes many forms, may rest in several departments, and may 
have been gathered at different times for purposes. It is likely that different pieces of information gathered in different ways over 
time may overlap, and it is equally likely that some parts of existing descriptive information is unique. For example, staff at the 
Oregon Historical Society discovered that the Library, the Archives, and the Collections departments all possessed some 
descriptive information about particular companies in Oregon. As the departments discussed the types of information that they 
had about these entities, they realized that it would be useful for each department to be able to use the other's information 
because in parts of the organization there were gathered facts about the history of companies and in others, information about 
the output of those companies. The photo archives had photographs taken of and by them, and oral history included 
conversations with people related to them. In fact, in some cases, one department might have a very thoroughly documented 
narrative histories that would benefit all of the departments. If the organization were creating a shared database, to which all 
departments had access, there was no need for each department to maintain duplicate narratives on particular topics. </font></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><font size="3">The </font><a name="Concept"><font size="3">Concept</font></a><font size="3"> of Integrated Information Systems</font></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several ways to facilitate the search and retrieval of information that is common to each of the internal information 
systems that an organization maintains. The first and simplest approach involves creating a high-level menu that lets users choose 
their database, format their own searches, and requires that they move sequentially from one to the next database, with no 
integration across systems. Typically, users can adapt to different database command structures. However, the question is not 
whether they can adapt, but rather whether they want to spend the time doing so. The less time a user needs to spend 
negotiating search commands, the more time that user will have to spend searching your collections. The second approach 
involves keeping the information in each of the stand-alone systems that are operating (collections database, library online 
catalog), and using a search engine to execute sequential searches across those systems, each time formulating a query using the 
search language that matches the particular system. The drawbacks of this approach include the difficulty of programming a 
search engine to perform a variety of search queries and to return the results in different formats, and the concerns over exposing 
internal production systems to potentially high volumes of public use and unwanted hacking. A third approach might involve an 
organization choosing one database and search engine to serve all of its needs, which would necessitate the translation of several 
data formats into one (using the lowest common denominator principle), thereby producing a leveling effect on all of the data 
produced by different departments. While some organizations may be at a point where they are ready to negotiate new contracts 
for each of their internal database systems, the likelihood of this occurring is rare, as is the probability that all departments might 
agree to using the same system, due to the specialized format and descriptive needs involved in working with many types of 
information (e.g., objects, manuscripts, photos). This paper advocates yet a fourth approach-that of the integrated system-a 
system that can be built to collect metadata from the various legacy systems within an organization to create a new database for 
public use. This new database is not maintained-the legacy systems still serve as production systems within the museum. Rather, 
it is a file that can be refreshed on a periodic basis, which can be searched in a variety of ways, through which a museum can 
establish links among similar types of information across departments, without having to re-structure its internal production 
systems. The ideal integrated information system would be one which retrieves directly from each production database within 
and organization, with a minimum of overhead-only the formatting and linking information between similar information across 
systems. While this ideal is not commercially available today, the realization of this goal is close, given current work on 
interoperability and semantic retrieval systems.<a href="blackaby2.htm#1"><sup><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></sup></a> The premise behind advocating this approach is that there are distinct reasons 
why the museum community shall maintain a variety of data formats and classification schemes-arguments that are deeply rooted 
in the need to preserve contextual validity and meaning, and the inability to shoulder the significant economic investment in 
large-scale conversion or re-creation of existing metadata. </p>
<blockquote>
<h3><a name="Visualizing"><font size="3"><b>Visualizing</b></font></a><font size="3"><b> Museum Information in terms of Data Structures</b></font></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>In planning to bring disparate pieces of information together through one integrated system, data should not be considered simply 
in the way it relates to one specific purpose, like a collections catalogue. Data needs to be visualized and prepared so that it is in 
a format that can be used for many purposes. Materials from such museum activities as exhibits need to be considered so as to 
be integrated with other information in an organization. Similarly, information about collections that span multiple institutions 
needs to be incorporated into the mix of resources. Data ought to be organized from the start and considered as a whole in 
order to accommodate all of these possibilities in developing an integrated system, the digital counterpart to an institution, a side 
the public may most easily access apart from the physical collections. </p>
<p>Of course, that is much easier said than done. Museums accumulate, and for all kinds of very good reasons, the materials that 
they gather are not "organized from the start" or considered as wholes. Excluding for the moment that items within the collection 
are apt to be information resources for the collection (think of vertical files full of company catalogues or collections of architect's 
papers or the notes of a 19<sup>th</sup> century horticulturist sketching mushrooms in the wild), the information resources of a museum 
have developed very distinct ways of being recorded. Several common types can be noted just to serve as reminders of what 
the task of integration involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some aspects of museum data systems have depended upon the <b>forms</b> that materials take - bound books utilize different 
systems than loose papers and both are apt to be different from "objects." Photographs and slides are apt to be specially 
treated, films, oral history materials (tapes and transcripts), drawings, maps, bound manuscript materials like diaries and 
ledgers, stamps, coins, botanical specimens, living species - all of these are apt to have developed more or less special 
methods of recordation. To an extent, the library world has enabled common ways of addressing the needs of different 
types of artifacts, but that fact does not mean that institutions have found those tools useful or even used them when they 
were. </li>
<li>Some of the data that museums have gathered depend exclusively upon <b>topic</b><b><i>.</i></b> Vertical files, scrapbooks, preambles to 
finding aids, exhibit label copy stored away, and many other information resources and cataloguing aids depend upon 
generalized topics as their organizing principle. In some cases, these resources may be randomly organized - some curator 
established a file for "Blacksmithing" in a cabinet full of folders on similar topics, and ever since then any general bit of 
information on that topic has been stuck in that folder. Some are more systematic - the books of the origins of place 
names or files of clippings, for instance. Some are intentionally abstract, such as the cataloguing tools that have been 
developed or adopted by museums to define concepts such as style or use or classification. </li>
<li>Some data that museums have gathered is intended specifically to establish <b>connections</b> between otherwise disparate 
materials. Again, some of these efforts are haphazard - scrapbooks, file folders, and ledgers are apt to be used. But, 
some of them have been more systematic - central files of names, especially for donors or figures of special historical 
significance, are the most common, but some museums have chronologies that are shared across collections, and some 
use natural grouping factors such as place names as ways of creating connections, as with post card collections and 
photograph collections and occasionally collections such as architectural materials. </li>
</ul>
<p>Not surprisingly, the formal information systems that museums have developed reflect these different approaches. Museum 
organization traditionally reflects the form that materials take - the departments of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum include 
the Archives, the Photo Archives, Oral History, the Library, Film and Video, and Collections (which means all types of objects, 
often including archival, photographic, and library materials that is perceived as being significant as "objects.") Though other 
museums may be more or less strictly divided (the splitting apart of all things thinner than a dime except paintings from all things 
thicker except books is the common structure for small historical societies), divisions along the lines of object form are common. 
The fact of that practical and political division has done much to encourage "special" ways of recording information about each 
form. Hybrids exist - library management tools have been adapted to recording data about objects and there are a variety of 
home-grown approaches to dealing with all of those materials that don't fall clearly under the purview of librarians on the one 
hand and object curators on the other - but the fact of these hybrids only helps to point towards the fact of the differences. </p>
<p>To an extent, hierarchical approaches to thinking about museum information ranging from adapting the Dewey Decimal System 
to the uniform application of the <i>Art and Architecture Thesaurus</i> in all information systems have helped to bridge the divides 
that prevent different forms of materials from being integrated into a single system. For a time, the Margaret Woodbury Strong 
Museum used the hierarchical categories described in <i>Nomenclature for Museum Cataloguing</i> to delineate its departments 
rather than the more traditional forms that materials took, and the Henry Ford Museum has a long history of creative 
organizational approaches to collections, but such extreme experiments in integration have been rare in historical museums. 
Natural history collections are often more interesting models in this regard, and art museums where there may be less difference 
in the form of collections are often organized by topic - usually geographical, chronological, or stylistic similarity. These 
institutional structures and reliance on standard topical approaches suggest some models for integration that are interesting. Of 
course, sometimes the form that they take is no more complex than the use throughout a museum of the Library of Congress 
subject headings as subjects for books, as a data element in recording information about objects, and as a standard vocabulary 
to describe the content of photographs. </p>
<p>Similarly interesting have been the electronic tools (primarily) that have developed in recent years to establish relationships within 
single parts of organizations as well across departments. The relational model now familiar in database tools begins to make itself 
felt in museums as a consideration as the example of the Oregon Historical Society's realization that when its information holdings 
were viewed as a whole - apart from departmental divisions - there was a great deal of commonality. Of course, recognizing that 
the Rose Lumber Company about which the archives has prepared a company history for the finding aid organizing the company 
papers, for which the photo collection has views, from which the objects collection has artifacts and recorded commentary 
about the provenance of those artifacts, and so <i>could</i> be related in an organization and actually realizing such integration are two 
very different things. Beginning to recognize that links could exist is an important step forward.</p>
<p>Any system that is going to integrate the data that is managed by museums must take into account that there may be as many 
good reasons for keeping data that has been gathered about collections by form separate as there are for combining it, that there 
will be hierarchical constructs that may be more or less available and of greater or lesser importance to data managers, and that 
there may be many more potential relationships within museum data than have been identified or developed. In addition, because 
administrative structure so often mirrors data structure and compatibility, the problems of integration may take on political 
overtones not warranted by the data. And finally, because data accumulates in museums, even if the one perfect system could be 
found to accommodate all users so that integration could be assured as all data entered the institutional systems, the likelihood of 
working backwards through layers of existing materials is small. On that account, an alternative approach that involves 
generating metadata from any existing data sources has been followed with considerable success by the authors.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><font size="3">Images and non-textual Media</font></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most appealing aspects of multimedia technology is that it enables museums to extend the way in which they 
represent their collections by sharing still images, video, and audio with the public. Images and non-textual media can be used in 
a very flexible manner, but it is important to accommodate their <i>richest</i> use, and render these data <i>once</i> from analog to digital 
format, using a database (preferably the same one that you are developing for other applications). So, it is important to identify 
the materials to keep track internally of what you have captured, in what format and condition you captured it, what technical 
specifications were followed to accomplish the capture, and what type (if any) of changes were made to the digital objects to 
render them easily usable in your intended applications. For instance, you may capture a digital image of a photograph once by 
scanning it at a fairly high resolution, storing a master archival file in a lossless format. In order to render the image on the web, 
you will need to downsize it considerably, and probably change its format to a lossy format. In doing so, you need to remember 
to do two things: </p>
<ul>
<li>document in a database the exact process you followed to capture the image in the archival format; </li>
<li>devise a filenaming or storing scheme so that you can establish meaningful links between the master filename and the 
derivative image; </li>
</ul>
<p>Filenaming, format, and server storage schemes are necessary, and must be planned in advance. With some formats like TIFF 
(tagged image file format) it is possible to embed text tags in the image file as searchable identifiers. For example, full or fielded 
text, images (still and moving), or audio are usually held in multiple departments within an organization-the objects collection, the 
library, the archives and manuscripts collection, the prints and photographs collection. While there are similarities in handling text 
documents and multimedia documents, there is one major distinction: whereas text documents are <i>enhanced</i> by images, video, 
and sound, media objects are usually dependent on text to identify or describe them within the context of a multimedia 
presentation to users. </p>
<p>Although storage and delivery of images and multimedia are not linked thematically to metadata, working with multimedia 
requires careful planning for the amount and types of storage, and the type of computing and networking that will support the 
effective delivery of media along with text. Images, video, and audio require significantly more storage than text, and ideally they 
need as high a network bandwidth as possible for reasonable delivery speeds. The experience of those who work with Web and 
other networked multimedia applications have had to make trade-offs between high image fidelity and the limits of network 
bandwidth to deliver large files to the user desktop. Typically, images and video may be produced at a high archival quality, then 
reduced or compressed in size in order to accommodate effective delivery across a network. The types of derivative files that 
are created out of archival master files need to be somehow linked with the master file. Somewhere in the museum's 
record-keeping systems a definitive record of these copies ought to be kept. </p>
<h3><a name="Metadata"><font size="3">Metadata</font></a><font size="3"> as a Solution for Working with Mixed Media</font></h3>
<p>The approach we find most useful for developing the integrated version of a museum's data resources has been to develop a 
very simple format for accumulating metadata - a text representation of any data component that is perceived as discrete - an 
object record, a finding aid, a book catalog card, an entry out of a catalogue, a photo caption, or a collection of specimens. By 
adding a few administrative fields beyond the text block as well as a way to identify elements from each text block that might be 
candidates for interpretation with hierarchical tools/approaches, e.g. an indication of an object's classification, and elements likely 
to be parts of formally defined links, e.g. personal names, and place names, the challenge of giving access to integrated data is 
greatly simplified. The issues become those of conversion and parsing from native data formats into the metadata container, of 
providing normalization for those elements that are hierarchical or linked, and of course implementing access to the metadata 
with a search engine capable of providing satisfactory results, allowing recursive or subsequent queries, generating links, and 
providing hierarchical access to related materials where appropriate. These are not trivial tasks, but they are greatly simplified by 
the existence of the single container.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing is quite so simple. Reducing all data to a single container assumes that there is something like equality among 
each thing that is the occasion for a record, that there are not vertical relationships between parts, and that data elements reflect 
things that are kind of comparable. For most "things" a museum keeps track of, these may not be issues. A user seeing a list of 
items like that noted in the previous paragraph - object, finding aid, book, photo - might be well satisfied with the results of a 
query against the metadata. Limiting the scope of a search to a particular media, allowing access to related items, offering links 
to other items would be matters of user's choice. But additional measures seem appropriate to reflect variance in the scale of 
what a single element of metadata represents. In the case of the Oregon Historical Society, this has taken the form of a relatively 
simple distinction of data elements that bear parent/child relationships to one another being reflected as such. This allows 
searches on an item level or on a collection level (or both) to be supported with the ability to move from items to collections and 
collections to items. In addition, it is clear that some pieces of metadata-especially those involved in hierarchic relationships or 
which reflect from hierarchic standards-serve more as encyclopedic comments on other data elements than comments on items 
in the collection. Accordingly, some elements have been designated as "encyclopedic," i.e., the description of what was meant 
by the term "chest-on-frame" or what was meant by "Pre-Raphaelite" or what constituted the "ponticum series" of 
rhododendrons - all pieces of data apt to be found in museum information systems, but rarely very accessible to a questioning 
public.</p>
<p>Below are examples of metadata from the Archives and the Photographs departments of the U. S. Holocaust Memorial 
Museum:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="IMG00001.GIF" align="bottom" width="572" height="205"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">Exhibit 1 A search of the combined Library and Archives collections,</font><font size="4"> </font><font size="3">reprinted with permission of the U. S. Holocaust 
Memorial Museum.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">Exhibit 3 Photograph record display in the Inquery system, reprinted with permission of the U. S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">There are essentially two ways to bring together different data formats and present them to the public as a cohesive 
collection-either ask everyone to conform (on some level) to one fixed data format, regardless of the type of information, or 
manipulate the data using innovative database construction techniques that are built into some software programs. The first 
approach involves normalizing existing data so that it is a consistent format. For example, a large international agency that held 
metadata in different formats for approximately twenty countries recently converted all of these data into one SGML format. The 
second, a simple approach - creating a single source for metadata - along with designating parent-child relations and an 
encyclopedic quality for some instances of that metadata lacks the sophistication of many more ambitious approaches to unifying 
data. But, considering that it is very simple to implement, it generates surprisingly satisfying results. An example of this approach 
would involve each department (photographs, objects, archives, library) first generating an output file of data in their native 
structures, although the complete and identical dataset would not need to be generated. Therefore, information in the collections 
database about acquisition and physical condition might not be included in the file of metadata that is generated for public 
searching and viewing.</font></p>
<h3><a name="Standards"><font size="3">Standards</font></a><font size="3"> Development for Descriptive Metadata</font></h3>
<p>If you want to share data, between departments, or with other institutions, standards become important. The diversity of 
approaches across several disciplines poses challenges to the cohesive development of the categories of descriptive metadata 
for the combination of visual and textual resources in the museum and archival communities. Within the museum community 
considerable diversity of descriptive work exists due to the uniqueness of collections and the approaches to catalog, organize, 
describe, and present museum collections. Although this section focuses on standards for describing museums' digital 
information, the discussion cannot be held in isolation from the considerable prior work that has been done with traditional 
approaches to creating metadata (cataloging, indexing), as well as established methods for organizing, describing, and classifying 
collections. It appears that one of the biggest challenges facing museums that already have extensive manually indexed collection 
systems is using that data effectively without having to re-create or re-format significant portions of it. Bell, in writing about the 
descriptive work of art curators, comments that while technology has made it feasible to exchange information about art 
collections, not every curator chooses the same terminology to describe works of art. <a href="blackaby2.htm#2"><sup><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></sup></a> This observation is readily extended to 
all of the disciplines which are encompassed in museum collections-not everyone speaks a common language, even in cases 
where two museums contain objects and information on the same subjects.</p>
<p>Several controlled vocabularies and classification schemes have been used or recommended as standards for categorizing the 
content of original works, such as the <i>Art and Architecture Thesaurus</i> (AAT), the Library of Congress Subject Headings 
(LCSH), the Thesaurus of Graphic Materials, ICONCLASS, Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA), and 
<i>Nomenclature for Museum Cataloguing</i>. The list of approaches to organizing and describing objects, media, and text is 
extensive, and it represents the myriad of perspectives on manual classification and description. The schemes vary depending on 
the focus of the organization and may not be adequate to serve the needs of all museums. It is understandably difficult to define 
areas of these schemes that have common meaning, given the diversity of museum collections. Work toward developing 
descriptive standards in this area, particularly in the arts, has been under way for some time. The Visual Resources Association 
(VRA) has developed a list of "core categories" for describing visual resources which covers information about the original 
object, its creator(s) and the surrogate digital image. <a href="blackaby2.htm#3"><sup><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></sup></a><sup> </sup>The VRA core categories were developed so that they reference the 
corresponding MARC cataloging fields, and so that they correspond to the Categories for the Description of Works of Art, 
developed by the VRA and a number of museum professional groups. The VRA core also takes into account the use of 
controlled vocabulary subject and name terms. The work of this group addresses an overarching framework of three general 
categories of image file description, including two categories that are used to describe the original object and who created it, and 
a category of information used to describe the surrogate or digital file for the object:</p>
<p>Object Categories </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Object Type/ Techniques/ Materials/ Dimensions/ <br>
Titles/ Larger Entity Names/ Dates/ Subjects/ <br>
Repository Name/ Repository Number/ Notes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creator Categories </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nationality/ Culture</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surrogate Categories </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Image Type/ Image Owner/ Image Owner Number/ Source </p>
</blockquote>
<p>OCLC (Online Computer Library Center), in collaboration with the CNI (Coalition for Networked Information), has sponsored 
a series of workshops over the past two years that have focused on the development of a core of elements that can be used as 
metadata to describe digital information. In 1995 a group of thirteen elements, labeled the "Dublin Core" was developed by this 
group. <a href="blackaby2.htm#4"><sup><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></sup></a></p>

<p align="center">Exhibit 4: The Dublin Core Elements <a href="blackaby2.htm#5"><sup><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></sup></a></p>
<p>The Dublin Core represented the first attempt at developing a common group of elements that could be used consistently to 
describe networked information resources. This core was expanded upon earlier this year at a second metadata workshop held 
in Warwick, England. The goal of the Warwick conference was to develop a framework for deploying electronic resource 
description. Dempsey and Weibel note that the utility of the Dublin Core lies in its simplicity and its flexibility:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dublin Core is intended to fill the niche between the terseness of the unstructured full-text 
web indexes and the structured description of more complex models such as MARC. It is 
intended to be sufficiently rich to support useful fielded retrieval but simple enough not to require 
specialist expertise or extensive manual effort to create. <a href="blackaby2.htm#6"><sup><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A significant outcome of the Warwick conference on metadata deployment was a proposed convention for embedding metadata 
in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) .<a href="blackaby2.htm#7"><sup><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></sup></a><sup><font size="1"><strong> </strong></font></sup>On September 23 and 24, OCLC and CNI hosted a workshop on metadata for 
networked images. The goal of this conference was "…to promote convergence among alternative approaches to describing 
images and image databases in networked environments." <a href="blackaby2.htm#8"><sup><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></sup></a> The outcome of the conference was a shared realization that images 
and text documents could be described in similar ways, with a recommendation for slight revision of the existing Dublin Core. <a href="blackaby2.htm#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a></p>
<h3><a name="Textual"><font size="3">Textual</font></a><font size="3"> Metadata Formats </font></h3>
<p><font size="3">Metadata can take on one of two formats-structured or unstructured. Examples of structured metadata can be found in many of 
the collections management systems that were built in the 1970's and 1980's. The MARC cataloging record consists of 
structured metadata, with specific fields, set field delimiters and other tags. The previous section reviewed standards for working 
with structured metadata. However, there is an increasing need to be able to work effectively with unstructured information. 
Examples of unstructured metadata include full-text documents like collection catalogs, journal articles, telephone directories, or 
training handbooks. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) represents one set of standards that accommodate text formatting 
for delivery and display across the Web, such as whether the title is bold or italicized, where the line and paragraph breaks 
occur, or the beginning and end of a document. HTML is limited, however in its inability to convey the content and meaning of 
the elements within a full text document. SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) represents another set of standards 
that support the identification of content elements in full text, such as the author, title, or subject of a work. Museums, libraries, 
publishers, and archives have developed SGML DTD's that can accommodate the kinds of different content of the information 
that these institutions handle. The work of the AITF (Art Information Task Force) and other groups has led to the development 
of an SGML DTD for museum information. The results of project CHIO (Cultural Heritage Information Online) will prove 
interesting since they will prove the feasibility of the use of the CIMI DTD as well as the use of a Z39.50 client to enable a 
search across the participating institutions who have provided metadata about their collections using this particular DTD. </font><a href="blackaby2.htm#10"><sup><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></sup></a><font size="3"> 
Similarly, work in the archival field has resulted in a DTD for creating SGML marked up finding aids. </font><a href="blackaby2.htm#11"><sup><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></sup></a></p>
<h3><a name="Database"><font size="3">Database</font></a><font size="3"> Models </font></h3>
<p><font size="3">Once the desired museum information is identified, the next step in creating an integrated system is to determine the structure of 
the database in which that information will be stored. The purpose of constructing a database with such great care is to ensure 
that all of the important relationships are firmly established within and between data elements and record types at the outset, so 
that these relationships can be fully exploited as the database grows. Worthington and Robinson emphasize the role of the 
database in their definition-- "The necessary feature which characterizes a database is its capacity not merely to store data items 
but also to record meaningful bindings or relationships among those items and to support multiple perspectives on both the data 
and their bindings." </font><a href="blackaby2.htm#12"><sup><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></sup></a><font size="3"> Worthington and Robinson identify essentially two fundamental types of database models that exist-the 
hierarchical or network model, and the relational model. The hierarchical model imposes a tree-like data structure, similar to a 
classified catalog, where super-categories subsume lesser or more specific categories of information. A collection arranged 
according to the Dewey Decimal system which originally presumed to organize all known information, represents a hierarchical 
model. The strength of hierarchical models is that they support a clear delineation of the relationships between the information 
elements in a collection. Geographic areas present a good example of effective use of hierarchies. For example, it is easily 
agreed that North America is the continent where one can find the United States, wherein one can locate the state of Illinois, and 
more specifically the city of Chicago. Hierarchical data models were employed in virtually all of the library online systems of the 
1970's and 1980's, and many of the museum collections databases of that same time period as well as the tools that were 
developed in support of museum information such as <i>Nomenclature</i> and <i>The Art and Architecture Thesaurus</i>. However, their 
chief weakness lies in the fact that they do not support multiple relationships between or among data elements, at different levels. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The relational data model uses tables in which attributes for a particular entity type are defined, with specific values that are 
assigned to that entity. Relationships between entities are indicated by either duplicating the attributes, or by establishing links 
between one table and the table with the shared attributes. Relational database software is the most commonly available 
commercial database product today (e.g., Microsoft Access, Foxpro). A theatre costume and set design database provides an 
interesting example of a relational database implementation at the University of Illinois. Several tables were set up within one 
Microsoft Access database, one for costumes and set descriptions, one for information from the theatrical productions such as 
reviews and cast lists, and one for technical notes on how images of the sets and costumes were produced. Relationships 
between entities that needed to share attributes were established in the database software. For instance, in an indexing record 
for a costume design for the character Portia from the Shakespeare play Merchant of Venice was linked to the entity in the 
production table that contained the information about that particular production. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Many existing software solutions for bringing together diverse formats of metadata operate on the relational database model, 
because more flexible relationships among data elements can be established once the data is moved from a hierarchical into a 
relational database structure, without corrupting the integrity of the original format of the data. Most of the search engines 
available, however, tend to favor hierarchical models because they treat a set of data as a whole without many ways to establish 
relations between database parts.</font></p>
<h3><a name="Search"><font size="3">Search</font></a><font size="3"> Engines</font><font size="1"> </font></h3>
<p><font size="3">Creating a system that enables users to retrieve information across various existing systems and data formats has benefits and 
drawbacks. The benefit is that information across departments can be brought together in a meaningful way without the user 
having to move physically (or virtually) from one collection to another. The drawback stems from the fact that the merging of 
data in different formats inherently dilutes hierarchical control and poses the challenge of working with multiple formats for 
information. For example, a search in a hierarchically organized collections database for all objects created by a particular artist 
retrieves a result that will only change if the museum adds another work created by that artist to the database. However, the 
same search across a combined file of objects, manuscripts, photographs, and library materials for materials by or about a 
particular artist might produce a very different, less predictable result, depending on the search engine, the way in which the 
merged data is structured and indexed, and the way in which the query is executed across the existing data. While this 
collocation of information is a boon for the user, one could say that it might play tricks on the minds of conscientious indexers, 
curators, and catalogers. It is important to note here that a number of studies have indicated that professional indexers, expert 
searchers, and naïve users rarely choose the same words to describe the same information. </font><a href="blackaby2.htm#13"><sup><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></sup></a><font size="3"> Some basic examples of the 
currently popular types of search engines may provide the reader with a deeper understanding of the ways in which search 
engines affect the ultimate results of a query. Numerous examples of virtually all of these systems can be found on the Web.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Turtle and Croft </font><a href="blackaby2.htm#14"><sup><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></sup></a><font size="3"> point out that there are essentially three types of information retrieval models that are currently in use: </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="3">Exact match: user input is searched against the database for matching terms or phrases. This type of system forms the 
basis of many commercial systems, including collections databases, and library online catalogs like OCLC (Online 
Computer Library Center);</font><font size="4"> </font></li>
<li><font size="3">Vector space models: user queries or documents are viewed as vectors in high-dimension vector space, with distance 
being the measure of similarity between documents. Use of this model is mainly confined to experimental systems, such as 
the VIBE (Visual Information Browsing Environment) at the University of Pittsburgh </font><a href="blackaby2.htm#15"><sup><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></sup></a><font size="3">;</font><font size="4"> </font></li>
<li><font size="3">Probabilistic retrieval models: use statistical methods to estimate the probability that a document satisfies a user's query. A 
number of Web search engines, including Lycos, and Infoseek, incorporate probabilistic retrieval models. The commercial 
software Inquery, developed at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, uses the probabilistic model. </font><a href="blackaby2.htm#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3">Exact match search systems are the most prevalent on the commercial market. They operate best with indexing or cataloging 
records (fielded and terse data), and can accommodate hierarchical control structures such as thesauri or other classification 
schemes. Search terms can be truncated and stemmed, boolean and proximity operators can be employed to increase the 
likelihood that a user's query will find matching information in the database. Since the vector space model is mainly in an 
experimental stage, it will not be discussed further in this context. Statistical methods are increasingly being employed to enhance 
the retrieval of information that is similar to that requested in a user's query, but may not otherwise be related to the search terms 
in a database. The probabilistic retrieval model is one statistical method that has been applied to the searching of full text 
documents and for databases with a combination of formats (which are essentially treated as full text). </font></p>
<h3><font size="3">The </font><a name="Museum"><font size="3">Museum</font></a><font size="3"> Educational Site Licensing Project</font></h3>
<p><font size="3">There are a number of useful examples of the development of metadata for the description of images that are currently accessible 
on the Web. The Museum Educational Site Licensing Project (MESL) is an important effort that is now serving as a testbed to 
determine how this and other descriptive metadata is presented and used. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The MESL was initiated in February, 1995 with partial sponsorship from the Getty Information Institute and MUSE Educational 
Media. The goal of the project is to test the feasibility of developing site licensing arrangements between museums and 
educational institutions in the United States. Seven U. S. universities are collaborating with six museums and the Library of 
Congress to provide networked access to over 8,000 images and their corresponding text descriptions. Faculty in Art History, 
and other arts and humanities disciplines are using the images for classroom teaching. The images and text are mounted locally 
by each of the seven universities. The project has a two-year duration. MESL participants include: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The primary goal of the project is to "define the terms and conditions under which digitized museum images and information can 
be distributed over campus networks for educational use." </font><a href="blackaby2.htm#17"><sup><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></sup></a><font size="3"> Related objectives include: </font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="3">Develop, test and evaluate procedures and mechanisms for the collection and dissemination of museum images and 
information; </font></li>
<li><font size="3">Propose a framework for a broadly-based system for the distribution of museum images and information on an on-going 
basis to the academic community; </font></li>
<li><font size="3">Document and communicate experience and discoveries of the project; </font><a href="blackaby2.htm#17"><sup><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></sup></a></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="3">Critical among these goals has been the development and testing of standards for image information and its related text. A 
practical approach was adopted from the outset to generate data from existing museum sources. The text descriptive information 
for the images supplied by museums was drawn from a combination of their exhibition catalogs and their collections maintenance 
databases. In order to provide some means of searching across structured data fields from different systems and museums, the 
participating museums and universities developed a structured data dictionary and used that as a guide for the export of 
information from their collections databases. Museums had to extract data from their existing collections systems or other 
databases and re-format it, mapping discrete elements of their data to the structured data dictionary fields. The MESL data 
dictionary contains thirty-two fields, with some of these being repeatable. The elements of the Dublin Core, where applicable, 
can be found. The goal of the data dictionary was to represent the types of elements that museum curators and art historians felt 
were critical to the identification of images. These elements include data such as artist/creator, title, date, subject, description 
accession number, material, type of art work. However, in mapping existing data structures into a new, common denominator 
data structure, not every museum provided the same depth of descriptive information, and it was difficult to discern commonly 
employed standards in museum artifact classification, due to the uniqueness of the materials that museums collect. Therefore, the 
level of subject analysis, and the method of classification employed may differ radically from one museum to another. For 
example, the Fowler Museum of Cultural History has a rich collection of Peruvian artifacts. Their descriptive information for the 
Peruvian materials will undoubtedly include more specific terms than that of another museum that does not have an in depth 
collection in this area. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The retrieval possibilities, however, are impressive. At the University of Illinois, the images are accessible through a Web site 
that is restricted to the University community, in accordance with the terms of the site license agreement. Users can either 
browse creator and title lists within a museum, or they can submit a search using a Web form, which is submitted to an SQL 
(Structured Query Language) search engine. Perhaps the most significant aspect of mounting this database is that users can 
search within one museum, or across all seven of the museums simultaneously. The search in the SQL search engine retrieves 
words or phrases that match the user's search terms, across eight of the thirty-two possible fields. The following example search 
for the terms "bridge" AND "painting" AND "monet" retrieves images which have in their text descriptions these three words, 
occurring anywhere in the eight fields which are searched by the SQL engine. The search retrieves eight matches in a thumbnail 
and brief text record list:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><img src="IMG00004.GIF" align="bottom" width="530" height="343"></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Exhibit 5 Search Results, bridge AND painting AND monet; MESL Search, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
(thumbnail image and text description of Claude Monet's Waterloo Bridge, Gray Day reprinted with permission of the National 
Gallery of Art, Washington, DC) </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The terms in the search are truncated, with an implicit boolean AND inserted between the terms, unless otherwise specified. The 
terms, adjusted for truncation and boolean operators, are then posted for keyword matches against seven of the thirty-two 
possible data dictionary fields within an SQL table. The matches that are returned are based on the occurrence of those terms 
within the fields searched. The user has several display options, including a view of a medium and a full-size version of the digital 
image, and a view of the complete indexing record for the item. While there are challenges to what the library world knows as 
consistent subject access, the example search suggests that the descriptive text that is supplied by the museums can be stored 
and manipulated to produce some very useful and interesting retrieval results for users.</font><font size="4"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The MESL group recognizes that using structured data, and the process of museums extracting specific information from their 
existing collections databases can be cumbersome. Museums are also using unstructured full text, and SGML (standard 
generalized markup language) with a DTD (document type definition) developed for either museum or archival information, such 
as those provided by the CIMI (Computer Information for Museum Interchange) group and by the library and archival 
community, which has developed the EAD (encoding for archival description) DTD.</font></p>
<h6><a name="Conclusion"><font size="3">Conclusion</font></a></h6>
<p><font size="3">The most impressive aspect of the array of possibilities before museums today - the search engines, database standards, 
reasoned approaches, digital images, and digital data - is that museums actually have developed <i>feasible approaches</i> to 
represent in meaningful ways the collections and the information that they manage. It may not be getting much easier to do, but 
there are possibilities. The success of the MESL project, the success of those few instances where search engines have been 
employed in either actual or test situations for museums, and the lively conversations that have developed in the museum 
community about providing meaningful public access to museum information indicate our progress. While the use of the web for 
these efforts has perhaps had only an indirect effect, the fact that the web has compelled museums to revisit the ways that they 
distribute information to the public and the tools that have been developed to support the kinds of things the web is used for has 
shaped the way that museums work in ways that we are only just beginning to see.</font></p>
