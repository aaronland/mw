<h2>From Pilot to Program: Organizing Content Creation as a Web Site Grows</h2>

<a name="intro">Over </a>the course of the last two and a half years, the <a
href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/">Canadian Museum of Civilization's
Web site</a> (CMCweb) has developed from a modest experiment, tasked on a
single individual, for the purpose of getting a feel for operating in
cyberspace, into a much more ambitious venture, more central to the
museum's strategic directions and harnessing the creative energies of
numerous people both inside and outside the institution.  The aim of this
paper is to convey some of the experience gained in trying to manage this
change.  We continue to grapple with the problems and so I won't pretend
to have any magic solutions or definitive answers, but can at least
address some of the issues; notably: where responsibility for a Web site
project should lie within an organization, whether content creation should
be done in-house or externally, and the need for quality control.</P>

<h2><a name="telling">Telling testimonials</a></h2>
<p>
But first, quotations from a few of the messages received from users of
CMCweb.  Netiquette requires that I not identify the senders, but I assure
you all the messages are genuine.
<p>
One man writes:
<ul>
<i>"My 12-year old daughter and I visited your site for the first time
this evening in search of information for a school project on Mayan
civilization.  Your exhibit is, in a word, incredible. Fascinating,
thorough, organized, easily-understood, beautiful pictures, drawings etc.
Congratulations!  We will be back!"</i>
</ul>
<p>
From a young male:
<ul>
<i>"I really enjoyed the exhibits and I found that they were educational
and informative and just what I needed for my project that I'm doing on
the founding of Canada."</i>
</ul>
<p>
A New York parent sent this message:
<ul>
<i>"My son, who is in the fourth grade, was assigned a report about the
Haida.  We have gotten so much information and have been able to view
artifacts, media etc. about them.  It has been fascinating for both of us.
We feel as though we've flown to Canada and visited in person.  One
day soon, we hope to!  In the meantime, thank you for sharing your
magnificent museum and services with us!"</i>
</ul>
<p>
A female surfer from the other side of the continent:
<ul>
<i>"This is a wonderful site!  Thank you for putting it on the Internet!
It is so very difficult to get visual images of eastern First Peoples
traditional clothing and products out here in California.  If possible,
I would like to see more Passamaquoddy garments, quillwork and moose
hair embroidery, etc.  I will be back."</i>
</ul>
<p>
This female writes from Texas:
<ul>
<i>"I'm a student at the Graduate School of Library and Info. Sci.... and
am doing a research paper on the role of archives in museum anthropology
research.  I was looking for examples of collections research for my paper
and was knocked out by the detail of info you offer to the public.
Perfect!"</i>
</ul>
<p>
From a Professor of History, again about our <a
href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/membrs/civiliz/maya/mminteng.html">Mayan
online exhibit</a> (a popular feature of our site):
<ul>
<i>"Congratulations on a well-conceived and enjoyable Mayan exhibit.  I
will encourage my students taking Latin American history this fall to visit
the site... Your site provides excellent cultural and historical background
to help students appreciate the triumphs and trials of Mayan culture."</i>
</ul>
<p>
From a teenager coming to the site from a cybercaf&eacute;:
<ul>
<i>"This is one of the best sites I've seen content wise.  You can
actually access stuff."</i>
</ul>
<p>
This last one another adult male (who originally contacted us with a
complaint about technical difficulty in logging in to the members'
section of our site):
<ul>
<i>"Thanks for your prompt reply to my login fubar ... all is now well.
Your team has done a great job of building this site.  I am pleased to see
that you used rule #1: content is king.  Nice graphics.  This page is
a nice reminder of our visit in June/96.  We shall be returning to this
page often."</i>
</ul>
<p>
I present these extracts not to blow my own horn &#151; "I come
to bury Caesar, not to praise him."  The point I wish to convey
is that the strength of CMCweb, and what its visitors appreciate
most, is its depth of useful, educational content.  As the last
quotation correctly surmised: the number one guiding principle
underlying CMCweb is that <em>content is king</em>.  Starting
from the perspective (or bias, if you will) that museums are
content-rich institutions with a fundamentally educational
mission, my vision of CMCweb has always been that its primary
task is to help make more widely available the museum's knowledge
resources.  This is not to deny the value of design (graphic or
educational), interactivity, or the various cool or fun elements
that adjunct applications allow to be incorporated into Web
pages.  There is no "right" model for museum Web sites, nor is it
desirable that we try to fit them into a standard mould;
diversity is the spice of life.  But, given that limited human
and financial resources make choices necessary, my main focus is
on building an extensive site covering a wide range of subjects.
Novice surfers tend to be thrilled by whatever they encounter on
the Web.  But familiarity breeds contempt: the realization that
many subject- areas, particularly in non-scientific disciplines,
are very patchily covered, if at all.  I've heard a number of
disillusioned colleagues dismiss the Web as not having any real
content (they mean, of course, in their particular area of
interest).  My philosophy is: it's no use complaining about it;
do something to rectify it.
<p>
<a href="#intro">introduction</a>&#160;&#160;&#124;&#160;&#160;

<h2><a name="genesis">Genesis of a Webmaster</a></h2>
<p>
Let me back up and provide a little historical context for the
initiation and development of CMC's Web project.  As a federal
institution, the CMC is given by Canada's <a
href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/cmc/cmceng/laweng.html">Museums
Act</a>the purpose of increasing among Canadians a knowledge of
their heritage.  The museum's <a
href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/cmc/cmceng/strateng.html">strategic
plan</a> takes this further by requiring it "To share and communicate
its knowledge to a degree unprecedented in museums".  This was one of
the key principles during the '80s, when <a
href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/cmc/cmceng/archieng.html">new
accommodations</a> were designed and built to house CMC, and services
and programmes were entirely rethought in the process.
<p>
Our CEO, <a
href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/cmc/cmceng/macdoeng.html">George
MacDonald</a>, saw that the museum needed to employ new technologies if
it expected to remain relevant to future generations, and this vision
became one cornerstone of strategic planning.  A sophisticated fibre-optic
LAN was put into the building.  We began to record electronic images of our
artifact and photo archives collections, initially on videodisc and now on
<a href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/cmc/cmceng/digiteng.html">Photo
CD</a>.  The museum entered into strategic alliances with Digital
Equipment of Canada and with Kodak Canada, in order to gain access to
expertise it couldn't afford to maintain in-house.  The Kodak alliance
will leave us with a digital imagebase approaching 300,000 items to channel
into the Web site, CD-ROMs and so on.  The <a
href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/cmc/cmceng/pr18eng.html">alliance
with Digital</a> brought us telecommunications expertise, access to
up-to-date hardware and software, and a well-connected commercial sector
organization wishing to work with a content-rich organization for the
purpose of developing and marketing multimedia services and products.  A
third collaboration, with Canada's National Research Council, which has
developed a <a
href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/cmc/cmceng/pr01eng.html">digital
3-D laser scanner system</a>, will give us an archive of three-dimensional
artifact images.
<p>
In early '94 a select number of staff were given introductory
Internet training, and later that year Digital proposed the idea
of the museum setting up a Web site, with itself as Internet
Service Provider.  Our visionary CEO had no difficulty in seeing
this as a logical extension of the direction the museum was
pursuing, and one capable of being handled through a low-risk,
low-investment pilot.  Having been duly fascinated and impressed
with first Gopher and then the Web itself, I volunteered or was
nominated (I don't recall which, and the difference is probably
moot), to plan and create the prototype Web site.  We felt it
would be a good idea, while the Web itself was still young, to
find out what was involved in creating and maintaining a Web
site, to get in at the low end of the learning curve, and to
capture an audience share as quickly as possible, while there
were relatively few online museums to compete with.  I picked up
HTML in a couple of hours, without any formal training &#151; in
those days it was less complex &#151; and found Web page
construction creatively rewarding.  I was given occasional help
from a staff designer and Digital provided CGI scripting and
server maintenance.
<p>
My vision was much the same then as it is today: to reflect the
breadth of the museum's activities and programmes, to respect the
museum metaphor and explore how it might be expressed in an
online environment, and to develop content of sufficient depth to
encourage people needing information on diverse subjects in the
field of human history to return regularly to our site.  The
basic goals established for the site were:
<ul>
<li>to promote the museum, in terms of increasing public
awareness, stimulating visitation, providing pre-visit
orientation, and generally striving to foster a closer client
relationship between the institution and its audiences;
<li>to present information of educational value, in particular
giving access to the museum's knowledge resources to those who,
for various reasons, may not be able to visit (or visit often)
the museum itself; and
<li>to explore ways of creating new revenue streams through
online services.
</ul>
My initial task was to create a foundation that could be built
upon.  As I created new pages, upgraded or updated others,
promoted the site to online audiences, championed the Web project
within the organization (spreading awareness and advocating
involvement), prepared plans for the future development of the
site, drafted guidelines for managing the Web project, dealt with
a growing number of user queries, and tried to come to terms with
the thornier issues of site visitation statistics, I gradually
settled into the role of Webmaster.  Today the Web remains by far
the most time-consuming of the various tasks for which, as
Special Projects Officer, I am responsible.
<p>
<a href="#intro">introduction</a>&#160;&#160;&#124;&#160;&#160;

<h2><a name="whose">Whose baby is it?</a></h2>
<p>
Why has the Web project remained in <em>my</em> lap, rather than
being passed on to some other area of operations?  Where within a
museum does responsibility for a Web site most naturally fall?
There are both pragmatic and philosophical aspects to the answers
to each question.
<p>
As for the particular circumstances of the CMC, it is part of the
role of a Special Projects Officer to run with new initiatives.
Since our CEO, to whose Office I am attached, was particularly
keen on the Web initiative and continues to be closely involved
in its strategic development, I was his natural choice to take
the lead.  In a large institution where staff have fairly
specialized roles, individuals can often be so focused on their
own area of activities, that they have a "can't see the forest
for the trees" outlook (hence museological debates over the
fundamental purpose of museums).  My past experiences working for
CMC had given me a broad overview of museological issues and
museum operations and therefore a good shot at representing the
various aspects of the institution in electronic form.  From my
education I had gained some ability to work with complex subject
matter and skills in organizing information. Add to this that I
had proven writing/editing skills, some computer literacy, and
above all an enthusiasm for the challenge of this project, and I
was perhaps a good choice.  Excuse my lack of modesty, and let me
add that I still keep on my PC the earliest version of the CMCweb
pages I created (now long since replaced) and look at them
occasionally to humble myself.
<p>
Discussions with colleagues have shown me that my circumstances
are not exceptional.  A number of museum Web sites have begun as
the projects of motivated individuals, in some cases with the
(sometimes hesitant) backing of an institution, or part of the
organization, in others as a purely personal venture on a private
Web page.  The pioneering individual might be some low-level
employee with surfing experience and an itch to try creating
his/her own Web page.  Or it might be a manager &#151; perhaps
one whose department or unit has handled multimedia projects in
the past &#151; who will not do the hands-on work personally but
will be an effective taskmaster and mentor of the project.  A
third scenario is for a Web project to begin as an agenda item in
the meetings of a museum's top management.  However, there is the
risk here of getting bogged down in studies, surveys,
considerations of cost and policy issues;  I know of more than
one Web project which has been long delayed or even cancelled
after an inordinate amount of management hand-wringing.
<p>
Museums shouldn't discount the value of the "pioneers", who are
likely to work above and beyond the call of duty to get a Web
site up and running.  If the human resources can be spared from
other duties, management may decide to create a working team, in
order to capture the wide range of skills needed;  but even here,
chances are there will be one particular member who is the real
champion pushing forward the project.  The key individual may not
necessarily be the most obvious, such as a computer technician;
it may instead be, for example, a librarian, an archaeologist, a
collections manager, or one of the museum's volunteers.  I
recommend museums try to identify such individuals within their
organizations, foster their enthusiasm, loosen the leash a
little, provide whatever support they can.  If managers are
themselves not familiar with the Web, they should be prepared to
allow some scope to their pioneers.  At the same time, they
should be prepared to provide guidance by defining, from the
beginning, the broad goals that the Web site should address, and
by giving constructive feedback that helps ensure the site
portrays an image with which the institution feels comfortable.
<p>
A spearheading individual may not be with an organization
indefinitely.  What happens to the Web site then?  This is one
argument for turning over the site, at least once the trial
period is over, to a particular section of the organization as a
continuing responsibility, or even for creating a new
organizational unit to take charge of the site.  In cases where a
Web project originates as an official management initiative, this
step may be considered immediately.  However, few museums are so
well-resourced they can afford to create an entirely new
department just to handle Web site development.  My own museum,
for example, has been subject to downsizing over the last couple
of years  &#151; not a favourable  environment in which to
contemplate adding a new team to the organizational structure.
<p>
If a Web project is to be assigned to an existing department
within the museum, which?  Chances are, departments are all fully
tasked, not enthusiastic about taking on another significant
responsibility, and not really able to assign the intensive
attention needed to make the site a success.  Nor, particularly
at the beginning of a Web project, may their staff be familiar
with the Internet and, as a result, undervalue the project.  On
the other hand, growth in awareness of the Web, or initial
success of a project, may engender in-fighting between
departments to control the project.  A further risk is that any
given department &#151; such as Education, Informatics,
Marketing, Exhibitions, or Publishing &#151; may impose upon the
Web project the local paradigm governing its own operations.  If
the Web site becomes only a giant brochure, an e-zine, an
electronic version of the museum exhibits, a neat computer
application, or something targeted only at school groups, its
true potential will be constrained.  At CMC, I have always tried
to promote a broader vision: that CMCweb is not a book, not a
magazine, not an exhibition, not a database, nor a media kit;  it
is all of these things, and more.  It is best understood as an
electronic analogy to the real-world museum: a tool to be applied
to diverse tasks and open to a variety of uses, many of which
have yet to be envisaged.  Inter-departmental responsibility for
a Web site might be a preferable approach to developing more
fully Web site potential.  However, as many institutions know,
inter-departmental efforts can become bogged down in politics.
<p>
On the whole, I am inclined to think that any museum wishing to
represent within its Web site the full spectrum of activities of
the institution would be wise to have the project overseen by top
management, just as the real museum is.  This may, however, be
personal bias speaking.  There is no set answer, and
generalization may be inappropriate.  Each institution has to
find a solution that works for its particular circumstances.
<p>
<a href="#intro">introduction</a>&#160;&#160;&#124;&#160;&#160;

<h2><a name="content">Content creation: who does the dirty work?</a></h2>
<p>
The foregoing discussion assumes that the work of content
creation, at least for the pilot, will be done in-house.  But of
course having it done by some external agency is another option,
and I'll return to this a little later.  An in-house pioneer can
only take a Web project so far.  Once the pilot phase has been
completed, museum management face a number of choices about where
to go from here.  If, after a reasonable trial period, visitation
statistics are disappointingly low, they may decide to drop the
Web site.  Or, if they have more foresight, they may decide that
what is needed is more aggressive efforts at promoting the site,
and/or a design revamp.  As far as content goes, they may be
satisfied with modest ambitions: little more than maintaining a
basic description of the facility, its current exhibits and
public programmes;  although resting on one's laurels cannot be
expected to attract heavy visitation.  Or they may wish to move
on to bigger and better.
<p>
Here let me return to the tale of the CMC's experience.  At the
time of the official launch of CMCweb, in front of the
corporation's Board of Trustees, I half-jokingly pointed out to
the Trustees how it had taken almost a decade to plan and build
the new Canadian Museum of Civilization, but only a few months to
build the online version.  I was younger and more foolish in
those days!  My real work was only just beginning.  A few months
down the road and I was realizing that simply keeping the
existing pages updated, as well as handling the wider range of
Webmaster duties (along with other duties not Web-related) was
obstructing progress in expanding the site.  Like Lewis Carroll's
Red Queen, I was having to run as fast as I could just to hold
position.
<p>
On the assumption that if I could learn HTML, anyone could, it
had been my hope from the beginning that other staff members
would also gain an enthusiasm and become involved in content
creation for CMCweb.  My initial idea was, once I had the
foundations of the site in place, to decentralize content
creation throughout the organization;  this was for various
reasons: to spread the workload;  to harness fresh ideas and new
creativity;  and to empower particularly the curators and
researchers to become directly involved in conveying their
knowledge.  I was encouraged in this hope by the fact that most
departments within the museum had been keen to provide me with
repurposable material when creating the pilot Web site.
<p>
In April '95 we ran two three-day training courses in Web page
creation, a large part of which involved small teams of trainees
working together to create very modest Web sites.  Two dozen
trainees were selected from staff having existing familiarity
with the Internet (a pool of roughly 90 individuals at that
point) and above-average computer literacy;  a third were drawn
from Research Branch, a third from Exhibitions and Programmes
Branch, and the remaining third from the Collections and
Information Access, Public Affairs and Administration Branches.
Although a number of the graduates of the course had ideas for
projects, and one or two actually began work on them &#151; one
in particular jumping in feet-first and embarking on what ended
up as a major component of our site  &#151; there was little
immediate consequence, in terms of content creation for CMCweb.
My naive enthusiasm had blinded me to the fact that staff
required not only training, but also the time to work on Web
projects and the approval of their managers;  this would mean a
commitment of resources from the Branches, with ramifications for
existing workplans and budgets, and (particularly in the case of
the researchers) a preparedness to recognize Web content
creation, along with more traditional forms of scholarly output,
in the peer review process.  Graduates also complained that they
did not have convenient access to PCs with the necessary tools
and power to create Web content.
<p>
To further matters, our CEO set up a Web Steering Committee whose
members are the Branch managers.  One of its roles was to
entertain proposals for major new additions to CMCweb.  Another
was to address issues relating to the furtherance of the project,
such as upgrading computer equipment.  To my duties were added
that of secretary to the Committee, coordinator between it and
the various departments and their trained content creators, and
liaison between the content creators and server administration.
A few proposals trickled in, but the problem remained that staff
were already overworked and couldn't find time to devote to
CMCweb, while managers similarly found it difficult to assign
priority to the Web given the other pressing demands on their
resources.
<p>
The lesson I was gradually learning was that it is, perhaps
inevitably, a slow process for awareness of the potential of a
Web site, and commitment to participation, to permeate through
any large institution.  This is part of the ongoing change in the
museum's organizational culture that is resulting from the
introduction of new technologies and the consequent need to change
the way we operate.
<p>
Contemporary with the creation of the Web Steering Committee,
another tack was being taken, in the form of recruiting an
assistant to help me on the Web project, under the title of
"Electronic Products Officer".  I was also assigned a larger
chunk of the time of a staff designer.  A number of other
Electronic Products Officers have now been recruited into the
organization &#151; one in the Communications Division, one in
Publishing, and one for the <a
href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/cwm/cwmeng/cwmeng.html">Canadian
War Museum</a> (an affiliate institution also represented on CMCweb);
although CMCweb is only one of their duties, their efforts in content
creation, or coordination of content creation, are helping move CMCweb
forward.
<p>
I'll interpose here a few words about the desirable qualities of
a Web content creator.  When recruiting my assistant, I
ambitiously sought candidates with the following set of
qualifications:
<ul>
<li>post-secondary education in a field related to human history
<li>experience in network-based delivery of information, electronic
publishing or computer programming
<li>computer-aided graphic design skills
<li>working knowledge of the World Wide Web and related applications,
and experience using HTML
<li>skill in written communications in both English and French
</ul>
I didn't really expect that any candidate would match the full
set. Nonetheless, the winning candidate has proven a real asset
to the Web project, not least because he brings aptitudes which I
lack and an eagerness to expand his skill-set.
<p>
I continue to believe that tomorrow's "star" content creators
will be those combining a range of computer skills, communication
skills, and the ability to deal intelligently with subject
domains they will cover in Web content.  A museum may have to
find this skill-set, along with project management abilities,
through a committee or team approach similar to that many
institutions use for exhibition development.  However, at least
one of the team should be doing the actual page creation.  My own
experiences make me feel that, because decisions often need to be
made "in the field" when a Web component is being created, that
page creation <i>per se</i> is not purely a mechanical function
and cannot safely be treated as something akin to a clerical
duty.
<p>
As for the CMCweb project today: things progress.  The
preparation and launch last summer of the <a
href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/membrs/lobby.html">Virtual
Museum</a> section of our Web site was a major undertaking which
would have been unachievable a year earlier.  With the Virtual
Museum's multiple online exhibits and other features, CMCweb now
comprises (I estimate) over 7,000 screens of information.  Our
approach to content creation has become diversified &#151; we are
trying out a range of options.  My small team still does much of
the work, but some projects have been contracted out to
commercial agencies &#151; both entire Web components or
particular elements, such as graphics or programming.  Student
work-placements or volunteer programmes have made it possible to
move forward on other content creation projects, not only because
this is relatively cheap labour, but also because they can make
available individuals with good mixes of subject-knowledge and
computer-literacy;  one student supplied us with QuickTime VR
experience, another one has taken an interest in VRML.  A few of
the HTML course graduates have contributed material.  Equally
important, a larger number of staff are more directly involved in
the Web project now, not in the actual content creation but in
planning particular components and in preparing "raw" material
that goes into the Web pages &#151; in retrospect this is
probably a more sensible use of their time and expertise than
expecting them to create Web pages themselves.
<p>
The Web project itself has diversified.  Other than a minor
advisory role, I had little to do with the
<a href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/boutique/">Cyberboutique</a>
section of our site, which was undertaken by one of the HTML
course graduates on staff, with technical aid through contracts
to private sector organizations.  Our Children's Museum used our
Web server to embark on a postcard exchange project with other Canadian
and Australian museums, and recently conducted a survey of those
visiting its part of the Web site, as a prelude to redesign and
expansion.  The Public Programmes Division is using the Web site
for an online educational programme with several schools, the
first of a series of such under the project title <a
href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/cmc/hats/sptopeng.html">"Cybermentor"</a>.
And the Publishing section has, again mainly using the services
of commercial organizations, recently launched the
<a href="http://www.mvnf.muse.digital.ca/entree.htm">Virtual
Museum of New France</a> on the museum's Web server.
<p>
Finally, beginning in the next fiscal year, CMCweb has found its
way into the Branches' workplans, so that there is concrete
commitment to specific Web projects within specific timeframes;
departments will plan and undertake those projects using their
own resources.  In sum, awareness of the Web as a multi-purpose
tool is growing throughout the organization.  The seed has
sprouted and, I believe, is about to flower.
<p>
Having said this, we still have much experience to gain in terms
of organizing and managing content creation in a cost-effective
fashion.  Should staff become more directly involved in Web page
creation?  Should we make greater use of university or college
students?  Should we contract out more projects?  There is no
easy answer for CMC, and it is even more difficult to generalize
for museum Web sites generally, since they vary greatly in
character, but I'll briefly look at some of the pros and cons.
<p>
As already indicated, I believe that staff with an inclination
and aptitude for Web content creation should be encouraged and
supported.  Self- motivation will tend to lead to skills
acquisition.  Learning HTML does not in itself make for creation
of good Web content, but  staff members will also know the
museum, have some sense of its goals, its audiences, its
information resources, and the image it wishes to cultivate, all
of which will help make a better product.  They may have had past
roles in developing exhibits, publications or educational
programmes;  if not, they will have access to advice from
colleagues with that experience.  Furthermore they will likely
work on projects related to the subject-areas in which they have
expertise.  At the very least the Web content creation experience
they acquire will be useful in helping them deal, in an informed
way, with external agents engaged to create Web pages.  If staff
time can be spared to a Web project, then this will keep the
costs down.
<p>
The downside is that content creation can require a lot of time,
particularly for a staff member going through the learning curve,
and organizations must be prepared for this to impact
significantly on other work.  It may be very difficult to find
someone who can drop other tasks to focus on a Web project;  and
if the wish is to develop a really successful site, the effort is
going to require more than one individual.  At the fast pace the
Web and its associated technologies are developing today, it is a
full-time job to keep atop of developments.  Museums must be
prepared to bear the costs not only of equipping in-house content
creators with adequate hardware and software, but also of
training and re-training, or at least for the time allocation for
self-training.  They must also accept the learning curve period,
which will vary depending on the existing skills and abilities of
the staff member &#151; it took me several months to start
producing pages at which I no longer grimace when I look at them.
This was tolerable in the "early days", but today audiences are
used to a higher standard.
<p>
On the other hand, if a museum can find no-one on its staff with
aptitude and inclination, but must rely entirely on outside
agencies to create, maintain and build its Web site, it must be
prepared to bear <em>those</em> costs.  A single staff-member
with enthusiastic dedication may be able to make progress by
bringing in students to assist with specific projects.  Many
post-secondary organizations now have multimedia technology
programmes, while museology or library science programmes are
increasingly incorporating courses  introducing students to
multimedia technologies.  We have had experience with both at
CMC.  At the risk of an unfair overgeneralization, I would say
that students specializing in multimedia technology are more
likely to create Web page designs that are appealing or cool, but
that museology students may be able to cope with organizing the
subject-content better.  In the former case, the structure and
content of each section should be well-planned in advance and
communicated clearly to students;  in the latter case, advice or
assistance with design elements may need to be provided.  In
either case, frequent consultation will be necessary and close
supervision of progress is advisable;  an attitude of "here's the
material, now go away and do it" is not likely to result in a
satisfactory product.  The time involved in this liaison will
partially offset the advantages of additional labour.
<p>
A third option is to take on the services of a company
specializing in Web page creation,  or to engage on a consultancy
basis a multimedia developer &#151; preferably one with museum
experience.  In theory, this is more likely to make available a
wider range of the necessary skills and experience, including
graphic design, application of the newer Web- related
applications, structuring a Web site, and effective presentation
of information.  The result will be a more stylish design, but
professional service will be relatively expensive.  It will
remain up to the museum to ensure that glitzy design doesn't
overwhelm the content, or that &#151; as is the case in some Web
sites &#151; prominent graphics aren't intended to disguise
shallowness of content. There is no shortage of commercial
services, which can be expected to have the necessary tools
(avoiding a cost to the museum), and competitive pricing can be
found, but skill-sets and extent of experience are likely to vary
widely, and one needs to be cautious in making a selection.
<p>
In the case of professional Web page designers, and sometimes


that of talented students, you may need to restrain them.  They
are likely to be most interested in creating the trendiest, most
state-of-the-art, site they can &#151; pushing their own skills
to the limit &#151; and unconcerned about how many Websurfers
will have the powerful PCs, good 'Net connections, or latest
browsers and plug-ins to allow them to take advantage of what has
been produced.  Museums should be prepared to make informed
decisions up-front about what they want from their Web site, what
audiences they are trying to reach, and what this means in terms
of Web page design;  then they must make sure this is properly
communicated to contractors or consultants.  Furthermore they
would be advised to prepare content material in some kind of
draft form to guide Web page development.  Again, this assumes
there is someone on staff with the necessary familiarity with the
Web to be able to communicate intelligently with private sector
Web page developers.
<p>
Without someone in-house with Web skills or experience, a museum
handing over a Web site project to an external agency risks
losing control over something which can impact on its public
image.  Museums should be very closely involved in defining the
character of their Web sites, instead of surrendering their fate
into the hands of those who know the Web, but may understand
little about museums.  A particular bugbear of mine is that we
are seeing school and university groups creating online what they
term "museums", which really only perpetuate the established
public misperception that museums are nothing more than a set of
exhibits.
<p>
The cost of a commercial service may not seem prohibitive when
compared to the cost of training one or more members of staff,
acquiring hardware and software for them, and then assigning them
time to develop a site.  However, any museum wishing to build or
change its site (and this should really include all) must face
not only the initial costs of site creation, but those for
maintenance, alteration and expansion.  The mutable nature of a
Web site means that cost comparison cannot be done on the same
basis as for, say, a CD-ROM product.  Furthermore, if for
whatever reason a museum dependent on an outside developer is
suddenly left in the lurch by that developer (and I have a
particular case in mind), it can do nothing with its Web site and
must turn the project over to a new company.  The design and
coding of Web pages is not so standard as to make this an easy
transition.

<h2><a name="quality">Quality control: how did we get into this mess?</a></h2>
<p>
The matter of site maintenance brings me to the last main topic I
want to address.  Quality control is a good idea from the very
beginning, but is likely to become more crucial as a site moves
from the pilot phase into something more permanent and probably
bigger.  "Creating content" isn't simply a case of writing a few
Web pages, loading them onto a server, and going away.
<p>
One of the earliest icons developed for use on Web pages was the
"Under Construction" logo;  and many Webmasters &#151; myself
included &#151; made use of it.  It only gradually dawned on us
how redundant this was:  that the nature of the medium was not
like a book, where publication ends the project, but that "under
construction" is the natural state of a Web site.  Any Web site
<em>not</em> under construction &#151; that is, being constantly
renewed or expanded &#151; is not liable to attract frequent
return visits.  As in the real world, museums want not only to
expand their base of first-time visitors, but also to draw
regular return visitors: their core audience.
<p>
Site creation is one thing;  site maintenance and expansion
present a whole new set of problems.  As a site ages, whether it
is through growth, changing content, or periodic renovation,
chances are that different individuals contribute to content
creation &#151; regardless of whether these are staff members,
students, outside contractors, or some combination.  You will get
different views as to what should be on the site, how best to
organize it, what it should look like, which HTML coding to use.
There may be similarly competing visions across the different
departments of a museum, introducing a political element into Web
site design.
<p>
One aspect of quality control relates to the information content
of Web pages.  The democratic character of Web publishing makes
it a vehicle in which information of dubious quality can easily
be presented.  Museums generally are very concerned about the
accuracy of information they present to the public.  In CMC's
case, that information is vetted by subject experts and then gone
through by editors, before being translated into Canada's other
official language and going through a new round of editing in the
second language.  The present development of federal government
policies regarding online services show the same concerns with
accuracy, integrity and bilingualism of information presented by
its departments and agencies, as well as concern for addressing
the special needs of the disadvantaged.  Commendable while all
this is, it adds complications and time to the development of Web
content.  In the case of CMCweb we have largely avoided some of
the issues by focusing on repurposing material produced for
exhibits or publications, that has already jumped through the
necessary hoops.  So I have no recommendations or advice here,
other than to say that the Web presents a new operating
environment &#151; in some ways a more forgiving one, in that its
content is susceptible to easy amendment &#151; and we need to
adapt our processes to that, rather than to try to teach old
tricks to a new dog.  Organizations need to find a balance that
allows valid concerns to be met but does not erect unnecessary
bureaucratic barriers to getting content up.
<p>
At CMC attention to quality control has focused more on larger
issues.  I mentioned above the project management mechanisms
established in the summer of '95, as our Web project moved beyond
the pilot phase to one in which I hoped there would be content
contributions from throughout the organization.  This situation
necessitated an approach to quality control, to ensure that
material added to CMCweb fitted in with  strategic directions,
that there was no duplication of effort occurring within the
museum, and that no undesirable material (such as hate
propaganda, politically incorrect matter, or personal viewpoints
not corresponding to those of the institution) made its way onto
the Web site.  With content for CMCweb now also being developed
by groups or individuals outside the institution, the need for
control and consistency is that much greater.
<p>
I completed the first edition of a set of guidelines in Fall '95,
and am presently drafting a revised edition.  This document has
three main components:
<ol>
<li>The first provides a common frame of reference by identifying
the vision for CMCweb, including the key goals (which I touched
on earlier).
<p>
<li>The second sets out the process of content development, in
terms of roles and responsibilities and the steps involved in
obtaining approvals and applying quality control.
<p>
<li>The third defines "house style", providing advice on various
design principles (e.g. page length, image size), indicating the
common elements that must appear on every page (notably dealing
with corporate identification, navigation, and document dating),
and indicating coding and file-naming conventions that are
important to managing the site and facilitating its maintenance.
</ol>
<p>
Essentially, the process is assumed to begin with a content
concept of some staff member who then must seek backing from
his/her Division, which will have to cover the costs of
developing the content unit;  alternatively it might be an
external proposal directed to one of the Divisions.  A brief
document is then produced by the Division to outline such things
as the nature of the content, envisaged size and lifetime of the
unit, goals and target audiences, sources of information to be
used, and an estimation of required resources and schedule for
production.  This document is reviewed by the museum's top
management, in their role as the Web Steering Committee.  If
approved, the concept proceeds to development either by one of
the trained content creators in-house, some external agency, or a
combination thereof;  quality of the information will be subject
to checking during this stage.  Once completed, the content unit
must receive Divisional review and approval before being
forwarded to the CMCweb Coordinator (myself) for technical
checking and, if necessary, minor revisions (to ensure compliance
with house style) prior to being loaded onto the server.  After
post-upload review from the perspective of operability, the Web
Steering Committee can review the finished product online to
ensure it complies broadly with the terms of the original proposal.
<p>
The aim of the process was to try to avoid creating too many
bureaucratic hoops that would slow down content creation, while
ensuring quality control at various stages.  Recently, with
awareness of and interest in CMCweb growing throughout the
institution, we decided to transfer the content proposal review
role from the Steering Committee (which meets infrequently) to
the Branches, in the hope of speeding up the process.  I cannot
claim the process is always followed to the letter, but the
safeguards are there when needed.
<p>
Nor can I emphasize enough the importance of having guidelines
when Web content is being developed in any kind of decentralized
fashion.  Content creators naturally tend  to focus on the units
they are developing, and to envisage them as self-contained Web
sites, giving little thought to those units fitting in to a
larger component.  I have learned through hard experience that
this is liable to be particularly true of external developers.
Having the guidelines is, of course, not enough.  It is important
that they be properly to communicated to all who may need to be
aware of them.
<p>
The more people who are creating content for your Web site, the
bigger the patchwork mess you risk ending up with, unless you
have someone responsible for coordination,  and have defined
standards that apply consistency where needed (this need not
inhibit creativity) and that facilitate overall management of the
site, both in terms of its development and its maintenance.  The
bigger a mess gets, the harder it is to clean up.  Written
guidelines, as well as page templates bearing common elements
that must be incorporated in all pages, are tools that museums'
Web site managers will find worth the time invested in them.
<p>
<a href="#intro">introduction</a>&#160;&#160;&#124;&#160;&#160;

<h2><a name="content">Content is king ... long live content!</a></h2>
<p>
It is dangerous to generalize about something so various and so
young as museums' Web sites.  The circumstances surrounding the
birth of a site, the extent of in-house resources available to
support that kind of project, the ambitions for and character of
each site, the size and degree of complexity of sites, are all
quite diverse &#151; "vive la diff&eacute;rence!" And it would be
presumptuous to suggest that, even after two and a half years
experience managing a Web site, I have solutions which others
should adopt.  All I have tried to do in this paper is identify
some of the issues and problems involved in managing the content
creation aspects of site development, and to describe the
experience of my own institution in striving to come to terms
with those issues and problems.
<p>
CMC remains as much in a learning situation as most other museums
developing Web sites.  When we began our Web project we had no
idea whether the Web would prove any more durable than its
predecessor, Gopher;  or, if it did, what future directions it
would take.  Our aim was simply to go with it, and grow with it,
and see where it would take us.  As our ambitions for CMCweb
&#151; notably to build a large, knowledge content-rich resource
that will expand indefinitely &#151; grew beyond the scope of a
one-person project, content creation took on new dimensions and
the need to manage the process became an institution-wide
concern.
<p>
I hope to see the day when content creation takes place more
routinely as a venture between museums, and between museums and
other cultural institutions.  I like to think of our human
heritage as a gigantic jigsaw puzzle of which parts are held by
museums, libraries, archives, historic sites, universities,
scholarly societies, media organizations, families, and so on.
Cyberspace offers the prospect of reconstituting that knowledge
of heritage to create a new entity, which might be called a
"mega-museum", or "meta-museum".  Before we can move on to that
higher stage of collaboration, we must first get our own houses
in order.  This paper has tried to suggest some of the options
available for museums to deal with content creation.  Whether
they bring this ability in-house or prefer to rely on external
production agencies is less important than them taking the lead
in planning and managing over the long-term something that may
evolve into a major service characterizing museums of the 21st
century.
