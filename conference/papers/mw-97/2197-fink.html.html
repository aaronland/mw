<h2>Sharing Cultural Entitlements in the Digital Age:<br>
Are we Building a Garden of Eden or a Patch of Weeds?</h2>


<p>I am delighted and honored to be invited to speak about how communications
technology such as the Web can help us preserve our cultural heritage and enhance
the world's access to it.  We are, after all, witnessing the convergence of
technologies that bring together text, still and moving images, and sound via
networks, and that allow people around the globe to connect with each other in
real time.  History has presented few comparable opportunities for cultural
institutions to shape their own destiny.  At the current pace of change and
opportunity, what might the future bring?  What might a conference on Museums
and the Web focus on, for example, in the year 2005?  Here is one scenario.
<p>

By 2005 successful models for integrating our cultural heritage have emerged. 
These models have led to virtual exhibitions and classrooms, and to enormous
virtual databases that unify information from databases around the globe.  Think
what such developments have meant for our cultural entitlements -- the cumulative
evidence of our cultural heritage scattered around the world in museums, libraries,
universities, and cultural centers.  The images and text of these untold numbers of
art objects, artifacts and literary works convey the passion and genius of their
creators.  When properly understood, they are signposts that help us understand 
ourselves and the global community in which we live.
<p>

In 2005, professors and students, curators and schoolchildren, you and I are able
to search the online universe seamlessly as if the images and text about culture
were available in one vast library of information.  We can enter a query by artist's
name, subject, or title of a work and retrieve images and related information no
matter where the digital data reside -- in essence, our search erases the boundaries
of time and place.  Overcoming these barriers has enabled new and broader
audiences to access cultural resources and construct their own stories for purposes
of research, education, and enjoyment.
<p>

Think of the research implications, the experience of new discoveries, the enigmas
that might be solved.  For example, in 1997 there was still tremendous mystery
surrounding the early inhabitants of Easter Island.  If you have ever visited Easter
Island, as I did some years ago by spending 10 days at sea, you would quickly
recognize why it is considered one of the loneliest places in the world.  The settlers
of this isolated island set about one of the most remarkable engineering projects of
ancient times.  They did not build fortresses and castles, or dams and wharves. 
They made gigantic stone figures in man's likeness.  They dragged these monoliths
in great numbers across country and set them up erect on huge stone terraces all
over the island.  What was the meaning of these statues, and how did their
creators manage this engineering feat?  Who were these ancient people?
<p>

Our chief hope of understanding the early Easter Islanders is the deciphering of
their unique hieroglyphic script, inscribed on wooden boards called "rongo-rongo
tablets."  Documentary evidence informed us that in 1864 there were hundreds of
rongo-rongo tablets in existence, yet a mere four years later, when the Bishop of
Tahiti set out to systematically collect and decipher the tablets, he could only
recover five of them.  As sailing ships traversing the South Pacific stopped at
Easter Island over the centuries, these tablets were scattered to the four winds.  By
1997, only twenty-one tablets had been traced to museums and private collections
around the world.  But how could you have even learned which museums had
them, and whether any offered their Easter Island materials in digital form?  Would
you have known to search under "Rapa Nui," "Ile de Pƒque," and "Osterinsel," as
well as "Easter Island"?  And how would you easily locate evidence of similar
cultures to help unravel the mystery of these ancient people?
<p>

By 2005, a number of crucial developments have allowed us to overcome these
physical and intellectual obstacles to integrating the world's cultural heritage
resources.
<p>
First, those of us in the cultural sector have come to realize that communications
technology provided a collaborative medium -- a network of networks allowing us
to join our cultural information with that of other institutions, on a variety of scales
from local to international.  Therefore, we have made our collection information --
text and images -- available on the Web.  Furthermore, we have recognized that
communications technology allows us to overcome barriers of time and place to an
extent that no other medium has ever allowed.  Understanding these aspects of
communications technology has let us integrate our cultural heritage resources far
more substantially than merely creating disparate institutional Web sites or 5000
bookmarks.
<p>

Second, we have realized the value of information architecture in the effective
integration of cultural heritage resources.  By information architecture I mean the
science of organizing information, based on the patterns inherent in data.  It
makes possible structures or maps of information that allow people to find their
personal paths to knowledge.  By 2005, research into information architecture has
identified metadata that could help establish deeper and more intelligent links
across the digital resources available on the Web, and agreement has been reached
on metadata standards for cultural heritage information.  This has enabled us both
to ask new types of questions, and to innovate in the ways we answered old ones.
<p>

Third, realizing the Web's collaborative opportunities, international consortia have
formed within the cultural sector to provide vocabularies and tools to help navigate
the online universe more effectively.  These consortia have enabled cultural
institutions to link their names, terms and concepts.  They have provided training in
the methods needed to place the terms in thesaural formats and to map name
forms so that cultural resources have become enriched cultural knowledge bases. 
Far beyond the tools available in 1997 such as AltaVista and Infoseek, in 2005 we
can use these cultural knowledge bases as filters to locate resources, overcoming
linguistic differences, spelling variations, and vernacular preferences.
<p>

Fourth, intellectual property rights issues have been largely resolved.  By 2005,
encryption standards have eased the concerns of museum directors that their
works will be misappropriated in digital form.  Rights clearance boards, site
licensing, and perhaps even micro-payments have given us all cost-effective access
to vast collections of museum images.
<p>

Fifth, universal guidelines and practices have emerged for gathering, digitizing,
storing, and distributing images and textual information.  Technical standards allow
images to be distributed via networks at better quality and higher speeds.
<p>

At the Museums and the Web conference in 2005 we find ourselves examining
models and discussing how we can integrate our cultural heritage more fully. 
We're addressing the sociological changes brought about through community
networks, which have become catalysts for expressing the creativity of cities,
regions, and nations.  They have become gateways to creating and experiencing
art and culture.  They provide a voice for cultural groups, empowering small arts
organizations as well as large, from the street artist to the grandest museum.
<p>

By 2005, the community network I envision has opened up classrooms to curricula
based on cultural resources that enhance the creativity, problem-solving, and
critical thinking skills essential to the modern workforce.
<p>

In a multicultural community, such a network can open the way to learning about
the world's many cultures and traditions.  And it can illuminate the community's
own heritage as expressed in its public buildings, monuments and neighborhoods. 
It can enable virtual exhibitions of the arts, design, literature, and science built
around community themes.
<p>

Not only would this multi-institutional community network open resources to the
people, it would encourage people to communicate with each other, enhancing the
human dimension of the cultural community.  People have in fact been weaned
away from broadcast television because they find it much more interesting to
communicate directly with and learn from people pursuing similar self-education
goals.
<p>

In short, such a network could become nothing less than a new domain of the
human spirit -- a territory of cultural discovery and innovation.
<p>

But let's be realistic.  None of this will happen unless we seize the moment and
make it happen.  Technology is not the chief barrier to this vision; the Internet is,
after all, a functioning network of networks.  Even money, in this era of dwindling
resources, is not the primary barrier.
<p>

Rather, the main obstacle to this vision is our reluctance to take risks, to overcome
our lack of resources by identifying strategic partners and developing collaborations
that can move us forward toward our mutual goals.  Achieving our vision will
require cultural organizations to become willing to collaborate and form new
partnerships.  Working alone, we can produce a lot of impoverished weed patches
that, given the competition from the business and entertainment sectors, no one
will want to visit.  Working together, we can create a magnificent garden with
something for everyone.
<p>

Over the next few days you will be presenting and sharing ideas and innovations
about ways in which we can more effectively harness the Web for the benefit of
our culture:  past, present, and future.  The future I've been describing in the year
2005 does not have to remain a dream.  In fact, during this conference you will
experience and hear about some of the efforts currently underway to make that
vision a reality.  Among them are the 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lacn.org/">Los Angeles Culture Net</a>; 
<li><a href="http://www.amn.org/AMICO">AMICO, the Art Museum Image Consortium</a>; <li>the <a href="http://www.ispo.cec.be/g7/projects/theme5.html">G-7 pilot project on multimedia access to the world's cultural heritage</a>; 
<li>the interoperability working group
of the European Union's Memorandum of Understanding consortium; and 
<li>the 
<a href="http://aqua.inria.fr/">Aquarelle</a> project.  
</ul>All of these projects are moving
us toward the vision of a global virtual database.  The 
<a href="http://www.rlg.org/strat/projahip.html">Distributed Database Initiative</a> of
the Getty Information Institute, in partnership with The Research Libraries Group, is
pioneering ways for consortia to enrich and maintain lexicons that will help us search the
on-line universe, and to navigate that virtual database.
<p>

For the moment, however, let me end with another scenario from our conference in
the year 2005.
<p>

Gathering to celebrate eight years of collaboration, the participants in the Museums
and the Web conference look back at the achievements they accomplished by
working together.  The rich array of cultural networks, innovative curricula, and on-
line exhibitions demonstrated at the conference leads us to recognize how
successfully we have capitalized on the unique opportunity to shape our own
digital future that we recognized at the inaugural Museums and the Web
conference in 1997.
<p>

We are the architects of the future; we can make this happen.  The future begins now.
