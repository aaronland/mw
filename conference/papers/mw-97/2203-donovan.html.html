<h1>The Best of Intentions: Public Access, the Web &amp; the Evolution
of Museum Automation</h1>

New Media Applications<br>
Intermuse, a division of Willoughby Associates, Limited<br>
Northwestern University Research Park, Evanston, IL<br>
<a href="http://www.willo.com/">http://www.willo.com</a><br>
<a href="mailto:kdonovan@willo.com">kdonovan@willo.com</a>
<p>
The World Wide Web has cast a powerful spell on museums and museum
professionals as a medium for reaching new audiences and fulfilling
their educational missions. The stunning response to this conference
supports this statement, as does the fact that museums are making
significant new rounds of investment in automation.</p>
<p>
That museums are making this investment is all the more surprising
given the unsatisfactory rates of return (ROI) that the past twenty
years of pouring money and staff into museum automation projects
has yielded with the exception of gains in two areas: office automation
and audit responsibility of collections. Twenty plus years into
the task, we have better looking documents and spreadsheets and
more accurate lists.</p>
<p>
A key justification cited for investing in WWW technologies is
on-line Public Access, i.e., using this extraordinary new distribution
medium to reach out beyond the confines of the physical building
to deliver the riches of the institution to school children, scholars
and the monolithically described &quot;general public&quot;. This
ambition is motivated, as in most things cultural heritage institutions
do, by the best of intentions. However, I would like to spend
my time today describing what I see as three issues that subvert
the best of intentions when it comes to providing substantive
educational experiences on-line. These three issues are:</p>
<ol>
<li>current notions about on-line Public Access;
<li>the content we have available and the way we organize it;
<li>the information sources used to feed on-line Public Access.
</li></ol>

<p>
I will close by proposing a new metaphor for organizing on-line
content that I believe is more likely to meet public needs, and
a museum information system model that can support this new metaphor.</p>
<p>
<h2>Access Is Not Enough</h2>
<p>
Let me begin by discussing the term Public Access, a widely used
term I find infuriatingly vague and meaningless. Why do I tilt
at this windmill? Because I dislike what I believe the term implies
and what in turn passes for meeting the needs of the public. Allow
me to share an anecdote with you. A formative experience in my
militancy about the educational mission of museums occurred when
a director I worked for complained about mounting community pressure
to make the museum more accessible and community oriented. His
defensive retort to the community's pressure, said straight-faced,
was &quot;The doors are always open.&quot; The pointed implication
of this statement was that, to him, providing physical access
to objects was the sum total of what museums are required to do
to meet their educational mission.</p>
<p>
Now not many museums display such egregiously pompous and effete
attitudes. However, there is a sense in the community that our
audiences <i><b>should</b></i> value us more than they do, and
that what we do to collect, preserve and display our cultural
and scientific heritage is so significant that its value <i><b>should</b></i>
be self-evident. (Vendors succumb to this type of thinking too
at times, but our clients, bless their hearts, disabuse us of
this delusion.) But as any paleontologist who has walked into
a gallery of Trecento Italian paintings can tell you, or any art
historian who has been confronted with a display case filled with
geological samples knows, objects do not give up the richness
of their history, context, and meaning easily. Museums need to
wrap layers of interpretation around the bare fact of an object
before the public can begin to grasp its significance. The same
holds true for the information we offer on-line to our publics.</p>
<p>
So what is my complaint about on-line Public Access? A look at
the definition of the word access is illustrates my concern. A
definition of access from the Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary
is: &quot;permission, liberty, or ability to enter, approach,
communicate with, or pass to and from.&quot; The problem with
the term Public Access is that the word access does not imply
any responsibility on the part of the museum <i>providing</i>
access to deliver any benefit to the person <i>given</i> access
(or to use the wording of the definition, given &quot;permission
to approach&quot;). The problem with the term Public Access is
that it contains no value statement. We let them in -- the door
is always open -- but in and of itself access to much of our on-line
sources is of little value because museums add so little value
to the data they provide. <!--What are we intending for broad public
audiences to get out of giving them permission to see this:[insert
example]--></p>
<p>
In comparison to a naked object record, the much derided practice
of museums turning their brochure information into Web pages is
surprisingly useful.</p>
<p>
The nominal utility to the broader public of information without
added value is better illustrated if we step briefly away from
the cultural heritage sector. Let's say you want to invest in
a stock mutual fund. Do you want to find a Web site that gives
historical perspective on the performance of different funds,
advice on how to start investing, and information that helps you
evaluate your investing options, or do you want a Web site that
provides today's stock quotes from the New York Stock Exchange?
Clearly you want the former. The latter, the stock quotes, do
not have much value added to them. You may find them useful later
on, when you are a more sophisticated investor, but they are worthless
to you now. Object data with no value added is of use only to
those who have sufficient knowledge to interpret and analyze it.
To posit that such information is somehow providing intellectual
access to the rich cultural and natural history represented by
works of art, artifacts and specimens is untenable. This is true
only if our &quot;public&quot; is confined to those who have endured
the catechism of an academic discipline.</p>
<p>
So I believe providing access alone is, at its heart, a cribbed
objective without higher aspirations-- an effort leaning back
on its heels rather than leaning in to the task -- and does not
prescribe any value to the access. In short, I believe the term
Public Access sets the bar too low. So I keep proposing terms
like on-line Public Education, on-line Public Learning, on-line
Public Programming, or a phrase like on-line Public Broadcasting
in an attempt to leverage the exemplary efforts of PBS. These
alternative terms imply a worthwhile outcome for the investment
made; that the end-user will learn or be entertained rather than
simply given access.</p>
<p>
<h2>How It Is Done Now: Leading With the Object</h2>
<p>
If one looks at how on-line Public Access is typically manifested
on museum Web sites -- particularly by art museums although less
so with history and science museums -- you find two common approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>static HTML pages
<li>search interfaces linked to databases
</li></ol>

<p>
The static HTML approach usually employs traditional museum organizing
metaphors based on the object. The standard navigational path
is to move from the museum as a whole to the gallery or collection,
then to a thumbnail representation of the object with cursory
label copy, then finally to a larger image of the object. The
site is often heavy on text up front and light on interactivity
and hyperlinks, despite interactivity being integral to a WWW
environment. In format and substance museum Web sites resemble
object labels and didactic text panels. This approach reproduces
the physical museum presentation method: object-centric, jargon-filled,
and segregated into galleries and wings, all of which are unnecessary
limitations within the grammar of the World Wide Web.<!--[example]--></p>

<p>
The search interface approach employs the frightful blank search
field method of providing access to data. <!--[example] -->This
method reproduces the most inscrutable characteristics of database
technology, a technology so daunting that even within museums
only those deliberate souls whose jobs depend on it, collections
managers and registrars, will use it. Nevertheless, a frequent
ambition of institutions developing a Web presence or considering
on-line Public Access is to &quot;put the collection on-line.&quot;
Most institutions have some sort of database management system
of collections information, and it seems natural to plug the database
into the Internet for all to see. However, I will submit that
apart from graduate students, scholars and aficionados, this information
is both a.) of little interest to the broader public and b.) difficult
to locate without a firm understanding of the information in the
database.</p>
<p>
To take the first point (i.e., who cares?) let me simply ask,
in the greater scheme of things, who is interested in the kind
of terse, fielded data found in a typical collections management
database? If the question is, Do you have? you will get an answer...if
you ask the question just right. But is this the question your
broader audience is asking? If you quantify the audience that
finds searching your database valuable, does that number justify
the effort and expense of mounting thousands or tens of thousands
of records and images on-line?</p>
<p>
As for the second point, I can hardly imagine a more insider concept
of Public Access than plopping someone in front of a blank field
and inviting them to, &quot;search.&quot; Search for what? Search
engines are powerful in the hands of those already armed with
sufficient information to make them work. If you know enough about
prints to look for Felix Buhot, fine, but if do not know George
Bellows from Saul Bellows, or chiaroscuro from caricature, a search
engine is of little use. Why didn't your query return results?
Did your query miss producing a substantive response by a millimeter
or by a mile? It is a frustrating mystery.</p>
<p>
Some herald assisted searching mechanisms like the Getty's impressive
<i>a.k.a</i> interface, CHIN's on-line authorities, or the straightforward
pick lists provided on the National Gallery of Art, Washington,
D.C. Web site, but since the information at the end of even the
successful search has so little added value, I consider this just
a better way to get to the wrong place. In many respects the older
hierarchical structures of the early Web and Gopher sites, that
parsed vast amounts of information into what the CIMI folks affectionately
refer to as &quot;chunks&quot;, are preferable to search engines
because there is a sense of navigating through the information,
knowing where you started and where you are, and gaining contextual
clues along the way to your ultimate destination.</p>
<p>
<h2>Consider The Source:</h2>
<p>
Collections management systems are good at making lists, but they
were never designed to provide the kind of on-line Public Learning
that I am championing. Likewise, the textual information that
comprises static HTML pages is drawn from all sorts of existing
printed materials: brochures, exhibit labels, catalogues, accession
cards, etc. Much of this information is object-centric as well
because it was produced to accompany the physical experience of
the objects on display. Small wonder that the information drawn
from these sources is list-like, object-centric and insufficient
to the task of creating compelling on-line experiences. Brochures
and collections databases are what is available, not necessarily
what is appropriate.</p>
<p>
So what am I proposing instead? I am proposing two changes that
are directly related to one another:</p>
<ol>
<li>Moving the operative metaphor for organizing and displaying
on-line Public Access away from list making to storytelling.
<li>Moving the museum information system paradigm away from just
collections management systems to content management systems capable
of dynamically delivering enriched, value-added content to Internet
and intranet-based on-line Public Learning interfaces.</li>
</ol>


<h2>The Question Isn't What?, It's So What?</h2>
<p>
In museums, the primacy of the authentic object is paramount.
In cyberspace, it's moot. The object is not available except in
surrogate form, so why organize content in an object-centric manner?
People do not care so much if you have a certain painting, artifact
or specimen as they are fascinated by all the context, the history,
associated with it. In other words, what people want to know is
not the What as much as the Who, Where, When, How and Why. Object
oriented information is at too fine a level of granularity to
be of use to most end-users. On-line Public Learning applications
would be better off serving higher level contextual information
through which end-users could drill, at their option, to reach
object specific information. Instead of leading with the object,
lead with the story of the culture, historical context, important
people and places, and their importance. Tell engaging stories
with objects woven through them. Do so via entertaining, prescribed
paths that both lead the user lightly by the hand and encourage
curiosity, exploration and serendipity.</p>
<p>
There are already museum sites that demonstrate these principles.
Among my favorites are Monticello and Odyssey. Even the august
National Gallery of Art Web site is showing sparks of imagination.</p>
<p>
The Monticello (<a
href="http://www.monticello.org/index.html">http://www.monticello.org/index.
html</a>) Web site
is exemplary for the light touch of its graphics, and hyperlinks
that encourage serendipity while avoiding disorganization. But
the most important thing about the site is the story-telling metaphors
used to organize information. Instead of offering a database for
obtaining terse artifact information about Jefferson's writing
desk, the staff at Monticello has wrapped value-added contextual
information around facts and figures in a crisply compelling narrative.
<!--[example]--></p>
<p>
Odyssey is a joint-venture between the University of Rochester,
Memorial Art Gallery (<a
href="http://www.rochester.edu/MAG/family.htm">http://www.rochester.edu/MAG/
family.htm</a>)
and Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University (<a
href="http://www.emory.edu/CARLOS/ODYSSEY/">http://www.emory.edu/CARLOS/ODYS
SEY/</a>)
that offers children an opportunity to learn about ancient cultures.
While important for several reasons, I like it for its smartly
written story-telling style. I found it similar to the popular
series of children's educational books from Dorling Kindersley.
<!--[example]--></p>
<p>
The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. has recently unveiled
a redesigned site that largely embraces the object-centric approaches
described earlier (but done in the National Gallery's customary
high style). Despite itself there are glimmers of imagination,
especially in the experimental section on John Singleton Copley's
painting, <i>Watson and the Shark</i>. What looks like the obligatory
.gif thumbnail is animated to alternate between details of the
painting and words like Boy, Danger!, Shark, Heroes, Suspense
that hook the viewer into the emotional and dramatic subject of
the painting. (How vulgar, how low-brow, how marvelously affective!)
<!--[example]-->There is even a link to a section labeled &quot;The
Story.&quot; Unfortunately, this section is not nearly as deep
as another link to a numbing formalist discussion of the painting
accompanied by an image whose ALT tag reads &quot;Compositional
Structure Mapped.&quot; Oh well, you have to take the good with
the pedantic.</p>
<p>
It is important to emphasize that all of the textual, graphic
and template components that make up these storytelling sites
can now be committed to, indexed, managed and delivered by database
tools. What looks and reads as a narrative to the end-user can,
in fact, be composed of fielded and full-text information elements
managed by a database. Building Web sites of any kind using static
HTML, rather than dynamically assembled HTML generated from database
sources, quickly becomes unwieldy to manage and difficult to keep
current. Also, static HTML simply cannot scale upwards as Web
sites grow in size and complexity. Dynamically generated Web content
delivered from information stored in databases is increasingly
the choice of Webmasters responsible for major content sites like
the C|Net, The Wall Street Journal and Pathfinder. And SGML encoding
standards described by the CIMI and EAD DTDs will create more
handles in our enriched information that our object-relational
database and indexing tools can use. This leads me to my final
point.</p>
<p>
<h2>Contribute Content To The Management System</h2>
<p>
You may well ask where all of the content elements that will make
up engaging on-line Public Learning offerings will come from.
My response is that museums generate much of this content all
the time. They just are not saving and managing it.</p>
<p>
Museum create all kinds of what I like to call enriched content
-- historical narratives, chronologies, biographical profiles,
images, video, audio, graphics -- for use in exhibits, publications,
marketing materials, and instructional curricula, etc., but little
if any of this content finds its way into a management system.
This is a major problem because, if you think about it, except
for the cost of developing and maintaining collections, museums
expend more time and effort creating content than anything else,
but that huge investment in content creation is largely lost to
the organization.</p>
<p>
Consider for a moment the development of an exhibition and accompanying
publication. Labels are written, texts are prepared, all sorts
of graphic elements are created, transparencies shot and scanned,
essays written, and on and on. At the end of the day -- after
tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent -- where
is all that content? Well, the curator has a copy of an essay
stored on a diskette somewhere; the registrar has basic object
information in the collections management database; the graphic
designer has page layouts on a Syquest drive and graphics and
scanned images stored in a separate database system; the educator
has a hard drive full of audience-specific curriculum and interpretive
materials. The exhibition is now gone, the accompanying publication
is not being distributed due to lack of demand after the exhibition,
and the content elements created are scattered throughout the
organization. Enormous financial and human resources are invested
in creating this content, but the result are &quot;one-off&quot;,
an unmanaged asset that is largely unavailable for reuse. Imagine
the value of accumulating this content over several years and
being able to repurpose it on-line.</p>
<p>
In order for on-line Public Learning to be as rich, compelling
and valuable as I envision, museum information systems need to
evolve from collections management systems to content management
systems. Content management systems will capture and manage all
of the enriched content elements museums create, and then deliver
them to Web-based interfaces in the public areas of the museum
and on the Internet. The kind of systems I am describing will
have all of the power and speed of relational databases along
with the ability to accommodate other information such as the
full range of multimedia sources as well as full text indexing
of HTML, SGML, and word processing documents. Flexible HTML templates
and scripts will format and parse data held by the content management
system; a repository that grows in richness and depth of information
over time because all of the content creators in the organization
contribute intellectual capital to the system.</p>
<p>
A change from collections management to content management will
require changes to the internal structure of the underlying database
as well. Instead of being object-centric and keyed to object numbers,
the database structure must confer equal status to information
about people, places and events, and allow relationships to be
defined between who, what, where, when, why and how.</p>
<p>
In order to capture information generated by content creators,
content management systems must be distributed throughout the
organization instead of sequestered in the collections area. Browser-based
interfaces can be customized for each department within the museum
in order to make contributing content efficient, while shielding
the end-user from the complexities of the underlying database
structure.<!--[diagram here, coll vs. content mgmt. systems]-->
</p>
<p>
Once museum automation is moved out of the back office and implemented
enterprise-wide, museums need to motivate those staff members
who create enriched content -- curators, conservators, and a group
whose voice is largely absent on museum Internet sites, educators
-- to contribute to the content management system. In addition
to their role as keepers, I also believe museums would be well
served to think of themselves as publishers. This would emphasize
the institutional value of creating content and managing this
valuable intellectual asset, just like a Time-Warner, Simon and
Schuster, or Disney does.</p>
<p>
Creating deep reservoirs of enriched content is very labor intensive
and cannot be achieved for entire collections. In terms of on-line
Public Learning it is better to spend a finite amount of time
developing rich story lines about a few <b>subjects</b> than a
thin layer of data for every <b>object</b>. A strategy of producing
&quot;small bites&quot; sets obtainable goals and assumes each
subsequent &quot;small bite&quot; leads to a more valuable whole.
Think of an on-line Public Learning story or program as an episode
to which the museum adds new episodes over time to produce a library
of stories and a source of versatile content that can be repurposed
for different audiences.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Simply providing the public with access to data is insufficient
to satisfy the goal of public education. To achieve on-line Public
Learning as I have described it museums need to offer enriched,
value-added content that supplements label copy and object records
with well-told stories that captivate and enlighten. If it is
more efficient to deliver browser-based on-line Public Learning
via database-driven sources, museum information systems must evolve
from object-centric collection management systems to context capable
content management systems. These content management systems will
require enterprise-wide, browser-based implementations so that
content creators can contribute their content to the management
system. By committing this value-added information to content
management systems museums will be able to publish compelling
on-line Public Learning programming via distribution systems like
the Internet, and preserve the valuable intellectual assets of
the institution. </p>
