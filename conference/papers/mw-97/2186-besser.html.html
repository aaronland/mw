<h2>Integrating Collections Management Information into Online Exhibits:
The Worldwide Web as a Facilitator for Linking 2 Separate Processes</h2>




<p>Historically, automation for exhibition and for collection management
have developed along very distinct and independent paths, with different
sets of vendors, software, tools, and platforms as well as no possibility
of integration.  The Worldwide Web offers the possibility of linking
collection management information to interactive exhibitions, overlaying
the narrative structure of exhibitions onto the item-based rich collection
of information found in collection management systems.  This paper
describes the concepts behind such an integrated system, explains what
activities will be needed to get there, and reviews some existing Web
activities that begin to approach such a future integration.</p>

<h3>Museum Automation through the mid-1990s:  Separate Paths for Collection
Management vs Exhibition</h3>
<p>Historically, most museum automation efforts have been driven by the
need for record-keeping and inventory control, and have resulted in
collection management systems.  A smaller set of automation efforts has
centered in museum education departments, and has focused on interactive
exhibits.  The vendors, software, tools, and platforms for computers used
in collection management have been very different from those in interactive
exhibitions.  (For a summary of the differing characteristics between the
two, see figure #1.)  This split was due to technological limitations, but
recent technological changes are likely to increasingly cause a convergence
between these two camps.</p>
<p>Collection management systems have historically handled very complex
information but have had poor user interfaces and been extremely difficult
to learn to use.  User interfaces for these systems were very slow to even
incorporate underlining or font changes, and not until the mid-1990s did
these systems make widespread use of a mouse and a graphic user interface.
Multimedia exhibitions, on the other hand, have used graphic,
point-and-click interfaces since the mid-1980s.  Because there is no chance
to give even a short "how-to-use" lesson to a museum visitor, these user
interfaces had to be intuitive and easy to use.</p>
<p>Collection management systems are object-based, and most data within
them refers to a particular object.  Though they can reflect  complex
relationships between objects, this is usually limited to situating an
object within a set (a group or a collection).  The relationship between an
object and other objects, people, or theories, (usually a key element of an
exhibition catalog) is seldom reflected in a collection management
system.</p>
<p>Multimedia exhibition packages, on the other hand, primarily offer a
narrative structure; they essentially tell a story and situate the objects
in some relationship with other objects, people, and theories.  They also
offer a coherent view of some domain, unlike collection management systems
which focus on individual objects.  In this sense they are much closer to
an exhibit or exhibition catalog than to a collection management
system.</p>

<b><i>figure #1:  The split between 2 types of Museum automation thru the
mid-1990s</i></b>

<p>Collection management systems attempt to create and store records for
every object in the museum.  Interactive exhibits, on the other hand,
usually store only a selected group of records and images -- just enough to
tell a story.  And while the records in the exhibition system may be
derived from records in the collection management system, they are often
enhanced and have always been stored in a separate location.</p>
<p>Collection management systems usually incorporate a powerful database,
and give users the opportunity to pose just about any possible query to
that database.  Interactive exhibit systems seldom contain a database.
Though on the surface these exhibit systems appear to give users a variety
of choices, usually the choice consists of multiple-choice branching, and
the user can only follow branches anticipated by the system designers.</p>
<p>Collection management systems have tended to be relatively open; for the
most part vendors have recognized the need to import records into these
systems and export them to other systems, and in recent years have provided
tools so that even naive users can perform these functions.  Interactive
exhibit systems, on the other hand, have almost always been "closed-box"
systems. They see themselves as stand-alone systems that have no need to
share information with other applications (except perhaps during the early
stage of a project when developers might take text or images from other
sources).</p>
<p>While collection management systems have always been dynamic (with
system tools oriented towards handling data that is constantly growing and
being updated), interactive exhibits have tended to have static contents.
Like a publishing media, interactive exhibits have mostly captured growing
and changing information and frozen it at a particular point in time, and
systems have seldom provided tools for updating that information.</p>
<h3>Technological Limitations Influenced this Split</h3>
<p>A number of technological limitations have led interactive exhibit
systems to evolve in this particular way.  Until recently, the vast storage
needs for digital multimedia had led most developers to favor analog
videodisc systems for exhibits incorporating images or multimedia.  Because
in the mid-to-late 1980s good toolkits for developing graphic user
interfaces were only available on single-user systems (like the Macintosh
at that point in time), most interactive exhibit developers conceptualized
their projects as single-user systems.  Developers chose to store their
text and images in whatever format would help them achieve the highest
performance, ignoring standard formats (which frequently diminished
multimedia performance).  They also discovered that they could simplify
their work if they chose to limit the total amount of information, and
control the types of questions that could be asked.  And because most
developers saw their work as ending with the installation of the
interactive exhibit, few considered implementation of a function to export
images or text.</p>
<p>Collection management systems were first implemented on mainframe
computers, then on early PCs -- both platforms that were slow to adopt
graphic user interfaces or incorporate images or multimedia.  System
vendors have seen their role as handling complex information about and
relationships between objects (in groups), and until recently ignored
technological developments bringing graphic interfaces and multimedia to
their platforms.</p>
<h3>Those Technological Limitations are Evaporating</h3>
Technological developments are creating a situation where collection
management systems and interactive exhibits begin to share more common
characteristics.  The advent of fasterprocessors, higher capacity digital
storage, and more efficient compression algorithms will soon eliminate some
of the major performance concerns that have led the interactive developers
to avoid standards and keep their text and images in formats that are
inaccessible from other applications.  This coupled with the development of
platform-independent multimedia authoring systems will likely lead
developers away from single-station, closed-box systems.</P>
<p>The advent of robust graphic user interface toolkits and software for
handling multimedia are making it easy for collection management systems to
develop better user interfaces and incorporate forms of multimedia.  As
they do this, on some levels they will begin to resemble the interactive
multimedia systems.</p>
<h3>The Promise of the Web</h3>
<p>But the recent development which holds the greatest promise for the
convergence between interactive exhibition systems and collection
management systems is the WorldWide Web (WWW).  The widespread deployment
of WWW browsing tools essentially creates tens of thousands of
multimedia-capable "clients".  This large "market" will provide incentive
for interactive developers to abandon closed-box, single-station systems in
favor of producing "servers" designed to deliver to multiple clients --
something that just wasn't possible before the number of clients had
reached a critical mass.</p>
<p>The WWW holds the promise of combining an overall narrative view of some
domain with a database of individual items.  A museum could create WWW
documents out of narrative essays from an exhibition catalog and link these
directly to object-level text and images from a collection management
system which is constantly being updated.  Thus, instead of the "frozen
snapshot" that characterizes most catalogs and interactive exhibits, the
WWW exhibit would be dynamically updated as collection management records
changed.  Furthermore, designers of a WWW interactive exhibit could allow
users to view any non-protected text or image within the collection
management system and to ask almost unlimited questions -- a radical
departure from the limited questioning available within current interactive
exhibits.</p>

<p>Most Web-based exhibits today follow the paradigm established a decade
ago by interactive multimedia exhibition packages: any images or text to be
used (within a Web exhibit) is copied from its normal storage spot and
inserted into a Web-based narrative.  But recently we have begun to see
applications that are likely to eventually lead to the break-up of this
paradigm.</p>
<p>The 2 critical features that museums and similar institutions are
beginning to use are database queries and collection-level views over
individual items.  The ability to link a Web page with a database is a
powerful tool that allows the user to change the focus of the interaction
and to request more detailed information about a particular object.  Though
few (if any) museums have yet used their collection management information
as a database linked to the Web pages of an online exhibit, a number
museums and similar collections have taken the first step in that direction
by putting item-level detailed object information into a database and
linking that into a Web-based query (see for example the Perseus Project
[<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">www.perseus.tufts.edu</a>], the US
Holocaust Museum [www.ushmm.org], and the Jepson Herbarium [<a
href="http://ucjeps.herb.berkeley.edu/smasch.html">http://ucjeps.herb.berkel
ey.edu/smasch.html</a>]).  Today we are at the stage of stand-alone queries
to an independent database, sometimes linked to narrative exhibits.  In the
future we are likely to see queries integrated into narrative text (where
instead of a hot-link to a pre-computed site, the hot-link is created on
the fly in response to a user query).  We can also expect to eventually see
these queries directed towards some more permanent storage of object-level
information (like a collection management system) rather than a database
that is excerpted from the permanent storage area.</p>
<p>The second critical factor moving in the direction of this convergence
is the recent movement in some domains to connect an overall view of a
collection with detailed item-level descriptions.  The archival community,
particularly the Encoded Archival Description Project (Finding Aids 1996),
has been the most active in building this type of system.  Like an online
museum exhibition, these projects have created online text (finding aids)
that describes groups of items and their contextual relationship to one
another.  But these systems then link this to the full description of
individual items so that the user can ask for item-level detail.
Interestingly, in most of these systems the item-level information is not
excerpted from another storage area, but is itself the definitive
item-level description that is updated whenever new information is noted.
These Finding Aids are encoded in SGML rather than a collection management
or database management system, but some employ software that effectively
turns SGML marked-up text into a database.</p>
<p>One potential new application area is to allow users to create their own
narratives over the source material.  An example of this can be found in
the Valley of the Shadow Project at the University of Virginia (Ayers
1993-).  Edward Ayers has created a narrative over a wide range of source
material in the form of personal papers, government documents, images, and
newspapers.  But he has also opened this up to other narratives that access
the same digital versions of primary source materials.  Teachers and
students at a number of other institutions have used the Web to create
their own narratives over this same set of source material.</p>
<p>A number of technical impediments still need to be overcome before we
see widespread adoption of this convergence.  Among these are database
interfaces from HTML documents which thusfar have required specialized
knowledge (such as familiarity with cgi-bin).  Utilities to link static Web
pages to dynamic databases are beginning to become available, and will
allow museums to more easily produce exhibits linked to object-level
records.</p>
<p>Another area that has not yet been adequately explored is security: how
to make available object-level records without providing access to
information that the museum may not want to make public.  This is a serious
issue even for museums that excerpt records from their collection
management systems and put them into some publicly-accessible space.
Certain fields are obvious candidates for exclusion (including donor
information, insurance and valuation).  But other areas are more
problematic.  For example, at least one museum contributing records to the
Museum Educational Site Licensing Project had to revisit several fields in
most records where curators had added information that was "true" enough
for themselves to look at, but might mislead the public which expects that
online museum information carries the authoritative weight of the museum
behind it.</p>
<p>In the future we are going to see the worlds of collection management
and online exhibition increasingly converge.  The WorldWide Web holds great
promise for making detailed object-level records available to users from
within a narrative or contextual description of a particular domain.</p>
