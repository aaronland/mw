<h2>The End of the Mausoleum: Museums in the Age of Electronic
Communication</h2>


<p>The German word museal (museumlike) has unpleasant overtones. It
describes objects to which the observer no longer has a vital relationship
and which are in the process of dying. They owe their preservation more to
historical respect than the needs of the present. Museum and mausoleum are
connected by more than phonetic association. Museums are the family
sepulchres of works of art (Adorno 1967:175). </p>
<p>In this short quotation from Theodor Adorno's article, "Valéry Proust
Museum", is embedded a set of ideas which until recently provided one
definition of the museum, in an intellectual tradition which reaches back
to Quatremere de Quincy and forward to Theodor Adorno and more recently
Douglas Crimp (Sherman 1994). It is a tradition which links the museum with
the more stultifying aspects of modernity. As Andreas Huyssen describes it,
the battle against the museum by those on the left and in the avant garde
movement has been a long one. For them, museums have "stood in the dead eye
of the storm of progress serving as a catalyst for the articulations of
tradition and nation, heritage and canon, and has provided the master maps
for the construction of cultural legitimacy in both a national and a
universalist sense" (Huyssen 1995:13). </p>
<p>While this intellectual tradition has a more popular face in the image
of the museum as a temple or treasure house - an image which reinforces the
idea of museums as having no connection to the present - it is also an
image which points to the central importance of objects, to the material
world, in constructing narratives of legitimacy. The materiality of objects
seemed to provide an empirical basis for nineteenth century ideas of
civilization as material progress at the same time as supporting ideas of
authenticity and originality. By studying the fabric of objects, museum
curators could classify them and order them into taxonomies in what
appeared to be an objective manner. These classifications and taxonomies
were themselves supported by a historical framework which used the
exhibition space of the museum to popularise a narrative of western society
as the pinnacle of civilisation. As Tony Bennett argues, the "emergence of
a historical frame for the display of museum exhibits was concurrent with
the development of an array of disciplines and other practices which aimed
at the life-like reproduction of an authenticated past and its
representation as a series of stages leading to the present" (Bennett
1988c: 88-89). As Bennett goes on to explain, this led to "universal
histories being annexed to national histories as, within the rhetorics of
each national museum complex, collections of national materials were
represented as the outcome and culmination of the universal story of
civilisation's development" (Bennett 1988: 89). Order was imposed on
heterogeneity. </p>
<p>As a consequence of this focus on the material qualities of the object,
museums laid themselves open to critiques which accused them of commodity
fetishisation, elitism, or reflecting bourgeois values. The New Museology,
for example, represents the most recent development of this line of
critique. It criticises the notion of the object as possessing inherent
moral, aesthetic characteristics or as reflecting an objectivist, empirical
representation of the social world ( Jordanova 1991, Kirschenblatt-Gimblett
1991, Sumarez-Smith 1991, Tawadros 1990) in order to politicise museum
representations. Notions of hegemony, domination and erasure of the 'other'
are used to point out that such a perspective is irrevocably part of a
hegemonic discourse in which claims about knowledge are presented in
absolute terms. </p>
<p>While these critiques have been important in opening up new perspectives
on museums, the focus of this paper will be not so much on criticising the
focus of museums on objects but on arguing that the status of objects
within museums, and hence their authority to 'speak' within this hegemonic
system of representation, is also being questioned by the inclusion in
exhibitions of non-objects - particularly mock-ups, audio-visual
technologies and interactive computer information points. Museums are now
continuous with the media. They use film, television footage, magazines and
newspapers in their exhibitions as sources of information and as part of
their displays. As Roger Miles (1993:27) suggests, "modern multimedia
exhibitions reflect not the international world of museums as repositories,
but the external world in which museums now find themselves. This is the
world of our post-industrial society - dominated by technology, with
pervasive media and advertising industries, and instantaneous electronic
communications; a society with a pluralistic culture in which the
boundaries between high art and mass culture have broken down".</p>
<p>Such inclusions, I want to argue, are breaking apart the centralising
impetus of the museum, forcing a questioning of its authoritative voice, a
questioning which is separate from, but adds to the impact of, the
political critiques I just mentioned. In particular, I want to suggest that
the association between electronic mediums of communication and the notion
of information can serve as a useful conceptual base for currently emerging
forms of museum practices. It is a conceptual tool which enables us to get
away from the reified concepts of authenticity, aura and originality which
have been, until recently, the basis for the museum's claim to knowledge.
This, I want to argue, opens up a space for museums which frees them of
their necessary association with the nation-state and with hierarchical
forms of power. It does this because the notion of information and its
association with electronic technology sets up a space which cannot be
understood as hierarchical, as setting up a distance between a centre of
power and its periphery. </p>
<h2>From treasure houses to touch screens </h2>
<p>One way of exploring how electronic technology can set up a
non-hierarchical space, is to make use of the Canadian tradition of
communication studies in which technologies are understood as having
cultural effects through their form as well as through their content.
Television, for example, is a cultural artefact through being a particular
kind of technological medium as much as through the programs which are
shown. This way of viewing technology has its origins in the work of Harold
Innis and Marshall McLuhan. Both Innis and McLuhan argued that
communication technologies have cultural effects as a result of the very
medium which they used. For Innis, any given civilisation would be prone to
a particular 'bias of communication' depending on whether its dominant
communication technology led to the control of space or of time (Innis
1973). </p>
<p>The uniqueness of electronic technology, as McLuhan pointed out, is that
it overcomes both biases. It erases time and space through speed (McLuhan
in his Introduction to Innis 1973). In Understanding Media , McLuhan
suggests that the "obsession with the older patterns of mechanical, one way
expansion from centres to margins is no longer relevant to our electric
world. Electricity does not centralise, but decentralises. It is like the
difference between a railway system and an electric grid system: the one
requires railheads and big urban centres. Electric power, equally available
in the farmhouse and the Executive Suite, permits any place to be a centre,
and does not require large aggregations" (McLuhan 1967:45). Politically the
implications are enormous. For McLuhan, electric speed is "bringing all
social and political functions together in a sudden implosion which has
highlighted human awareness of responsibility to an intense degree. It is
this implosive factor that alters the position of the Negro, the teenager,
and some other groups. They can no longer be contained, in the political
sense of limited association. They are now involved in our lives, as we in
theirs, thanks to the electric media" (McLuhan 1967:12-13). Electronic
technologies then, force interaction. </p>
<p>Taken to the museum, this means that the move from objects towards
information, a movement which is associated with electronic technologies,
should lead critical analysis away from a focus on questions of
representation towards a concern with articulation - with how the museum is
connected into and operates through other channels of communication such as
television, the internet, and film. </p>
<p>Looked at in this way, it is possible to reinterpret what sometimes
appears as a rather naive and utopian narrative around electronic
technologies and their social effects. While the discourse which
accompanies changes in museum practices makes it appear as if the links
being established between the museum and information technologies are part
of a democratising revolution in which the museum is being more responsible
to the public, ensuring 'access' to its communities, (for example MacDonald
1987, 1989, 1992) this is a discourse which has a much wider context, a
context which places the museum well within contemporary cultural change.
For the push to use technology and to become part of the information
society is not just ideological. It has a context in the changing nature of
tourism which is becoming transnational and an economic context which
demands that museums be assessed by the numbers which come through the
doors and not on the civilising effect of the museum, as well as in a
political climate which demands ever greater representation of and access
to different social groups. </p>
<h2>"A museum for the global village"</h2>
<p>I now want to look at how some of these issues are dealt with by museums
themselves by focusing on the Canadian National Museum of Civilisation and
the Australian National Maritime Museum. The Canadian Museum has been
described by its director, George MacDonald, as a museum of the
"information society", and as a "museum for the global village".
MacDonald's views are explicitly linked to the work of McLuhan and form
perhaps, the most strongly articulated arguments from within the museum
world for an engagement by the museum institution with  the new social
structures and values emerging out of the shift from an industrial to an
information society. </p>
<p>For  George MacDonald, "all museums are, at the most fundamental level,
concerned with information: its generation, its perpetuation, its
organisation, and its dissemination" (1992:161).  This means that objects
and other documentary material are important not for any intrinsic value
but for their information value. It is thus that he can claim that museums
are about information rather than objects. From an information perspective,
for MacDonald, there is no difference between an object and a photograph or
an oral history tape. All three represent information. </p>
<p>For MacDonald, this shift in valuing the object for its information
rather than its material value is symptomatic of the re-organisation of the
museum's social function, in line with the shift from an industrial to an
information society. For the "values, attitudes and perceptions that
accompany the technological transition from industrial to information
society can make it possible for museums to achieve their full potential as
places for learning in and about a world in which the globetrotting mass
media, international tourism, migration, and instant satellite links
between cultures are sculpting a new global awareness and helping give
shape to what Marshall McLuhan characterised as the global village"
(MacDonald 1992:161). </p>
<p>It is in this respect that the concept of information becomes important.
For MacDonald, the concept leads to a more dynamic conception of the
museum, beyond that of a repository, towards that of a resource which can
be tapped by users all over the world. Technology is crucial in turning the
museum from a repository to an information resource. In this light it is
interesting to take note of an article entitled "The intelligent museum",
by Eiji Mizushima, a Japanese systems engineer involved in the construction
of new museums. Mizushima defined the contemporary museum in terms of
information, a concept which he places in opposition to old fashioned
museums which he saw as static receptacles: </p>
<p><i>In speaking of modern museum architecture, I believe that the museums
should no longer be seen passively as a receptacle for collections and
visitors but, actively, as a device that receives and transmits information
and supports various museum activities dynamically</i> (Mizushima
1989:242).
For Mizushima, an 'intelligent museum' is "in essence one that highlights
information, and therefore makes structural provision for information
circulation and management" (Mizushima 1989:241). An intelligent museum is
one that
<i>(a) can control automatically museum operation  and management and
exhibit management; (b) can control the museum environment (exhibit
environment and conservation environment); (c) is structurally equipped,
both within and without, with information/communication capabilities; and
(d) can control with computers and 'new media' equipment a visitor
information service</i> (Mizushima 1989:242). </p>
<p>For Mizushima, a museum which is premised on a notion of information is
dynamic and interactive rather than static and authoritative. Such a museum
is, for Mizushima, contemporary in orientation. The technology needed to
establish the information flows is one which breaks the association of the
museum with a mausoleum, with the dead past. </p>
<p>Another example of such a re-orientation can be found in the
Australia-USA Gallery at the Australian National Maritime Museum.<i>1  This
gallery is interesting for it combines an indifference to the status of
objects with the way it uses electronic technology as well as reproductions
in its displays. The loss of the sanctity of the object, and its ability to
provide a direct link between past and present is apparent in the way in
which the opening exhibition for the USA-Australia gallery was developed.
One of the most pressing problems the gallery faced was the difficulty in
finding appropriate objects with which to tell the story of the maritime
links between the USA and Australia. Many of the interesting objects were
already in major collections in the USA and were not always available for
long term loan. Furthermore, the nature of the narrative was not always
compatible with the use of objects. A 'televisual' documentary approach
could deal with the issues the curators wanted to explore more effectively.
This was the case, for example with the display on Australia's involvement
in the Vietnam War for which a data base with a computer touch screen was
developed. This database used material broadcast on television during the
Vietnam war - a comment on the mediatised nature of the war itself and one
which was also used to great effect in the display dealing with the Gulf
war which was experienced in the West as a non-stop televisual spectacle -
as well as interviews with navy personnel and their experiences during the
war.</i></p>
<p>These display techniques highlight the way in which objects have lost
their central position within museum activity. Not only was collecting
display driven, but the need to develop the exhibition meant that
collecting objects was not the gallery's only task. To begin with,
photography became extremely important to the gallery's activities as did
film. For example, if objects were not available for loan, particularly
those located in America, a photograph was requested instead. These
eventually became graphics with accompanying labels, having a similar
status as objects in their narrative role. The value of both was defined in
terms of  information. The juxtaposition of graphics and objects is one of
the means by which the opposition between an original and its copy is
currently being confused. The focus on information has meant that messages
previously communicated by the object alone can now be communicated as
effectively by a photographic image. Graphics became important not only as
background material, providing context for the objects, but as artefacts in
their own right. A reproduction is just as valuable as the original for
this purpose, despite a residual sense of loss amongst the curators that
the original was unavailable for display. The mystique of authenticity had
all but disappeared. </p>
<p>This process of the disappearance or displacement of the object was
taken one step further in the creation of an exhibition in video and in
computer data bases, accessed by touch screens. There was in fact a
curatorial position within the staff of the gallery assigned entirely  to
the research and development of these electronic exhibitions. In the
Australia-USA gallery, videos were used to expand the interpretation of
objects and to cover stories which could not be told through objects.
Videos became an exhibition in themselves achieved through the visual
reproduction of the real event or object. So, for example, the themes of
the gallery are introduced by a video wall which uses a pastiche of images,
superimposed on one another and constantly changing to communicate the
subject of the gallery. The only interpretative aid is a musical/special
effects sound track. There is no label and no spoken narrative. This
exhibit is in fact an example of the way in which museum spaces are
becoming virtual  spaces - where images of museums, collections and
displays precede or become superimposed on actual museums, objects and
displays. </p>
<p>At another level, the idea of the virtual museum is also being taken up
in representations of cyberspace. For example, in the film Disclosure,
cyberspace holds the information which will provide the evidence needed by
the protagonist, played by Michael Douglas, to prove his innocence of the
charge of sexual harassment. Entry to this space of information is through
a traditional museum like atrium, entered through a classical doorway. In
this space are many doors which lead to different files. The space is a
maze as well as an archive of information.</p>
<p>The use of the traditional museum as an architectural symbol for virtual
reality or cyberspace illustrates the complex nature of the changes
involved in the way we conceptualize museums in the age of electronic
communication. In the popular imagination, as well as in established
academic discourses about museums, museums represent centralised power and
the material world, while virtual reality represents a more democratic and
immaterial space. If this is the case, why are museums becoming a popular
way of representing cyberspace? Why is it that, as the museum moves away
from a referent in a reality constructed through objects, as they change
their architectural design towards more open and less imposing
architectural forms, virtual reality takes up on the museum, in its
nineteenth century form, as a symbol for itself?</p>
One possible answer is indicated by the tone of the literature on virtual
technology and the internet - both emphasise questions of access and
democracy. Irrespective of the argument surrounding the issue of whether
the information highway is indeed more democratic than other media, taking
up the museum as a symbol for a virtual space makes such a claim more
concrete. As I have argued so far, museums have been associated with
privileged access to knowledge. They have been 'sacred spaces' open to
those who know how to read its rituals and texts (Duncan 1995). They were
socially and culturally exclusive. Putting museums on the net or into
virtual reality immediately undermines such claims to exclusiveness -
anyone can visit the Louvre or the Tate without physically having to go
there. They can behave and comment as they want while doing so. They can
even download or print copies of the artworks they see. Making 'forbidden'
spaces open is a recurring practice of virtual reality technologies - in
video games where military activities such as flying fighter jets are
available to children in simulation, and of course through simulated
pornography. The availability of museums alongside these forms of
entertainment only adds to the ways in which the museum, as a cultural
icon, is increasingly implicated in contemporary media flows. Virtually
reality is one of the ways in which traditional discourses of museums are
being re-troped so that new associations for old institutions can emerge.
</P>
<p>At the same time however, it is the popular association of the museum
with materiality and presence which also gives the museum its difference
from the world of simulation. For some commentators, the increasing
'museumfication' of the world through such things as historical recreations
in film and television documentaries means that the museum is now
inseparable from other media (Baudrillard 1983). But, as Andreas Huyssen
(1995) argues, because of the museum's continued claim to materiality,
museum and television gazes are not the same. For Huyssen, the suggestion
that the mass media, especially television, have created an unquenchable
desire for experiences and events, for authenticity and identity which
television is unable to satisfy, puts the museum in a unique situation. The
idea is particularly suggestive if one notes that the current museum boom
emerged at precisely the same point at which electronic technologies became
the basis for discussions about the 'information society'.
The increasing virtuality of the world seems to demand its own counterpoint
in the materiality of the object that has withstood time. Existence in time
creates its own aura, as Walter Benjamin (1973) pointed out, but this only
becomes significant if it can be counterpointed by its opposite.  As
Huyssen argues, "the need for auratic objects, for permanent embodiments,
for the experience of the out-of the ordinary, seems indisputably a key
factor of our museumphilia. Objects that have lasted through the ages are
by that very virtue located outside of the destructive circulation of
commodities destined for the garbage heap. ... The materiality of the
objects themselves seems to function like a guarantee against simulations"
(1995:33). </p>
<p>It would seem then, that the same objects' existence in virtual space or
in reproduction enhances its auratic presence in the material world. The
increasing museumfication of the world and the parallel mediatisation of
the museum have meant an uneasy tension in which the world of simulations
guarantees the continued relevance of the material world. While electronic
media have, I argued, enabled a questioning of the status of objects in
museums, with a consequent freeing up of the kinds of narratives museums
use in the interpretation of their collections, this electronic, virtual
world has at the same time, ensured the continued relevance of the material
world. The challenge for museums is that they now have an opportunity to
negotiate these tensions and, in the process, re-invent what we might mean
by a museum. </p>
