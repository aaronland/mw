<H2>The Digital Darwins Project:<BR>
3-D Resources for Interactive Natural Science via the Internet</H2>


<P>

<P>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
The Digital Darwins project <A HREF="#*">*</A> began last winter in a laboratory
at the National Zoological Park in Washington D.C.  There, Dr.
Alfie Rosenberger showed me work he was doing with a Laser Design
scanner, fondly referred to as Huxley.  Dr. Rosenberger, a leading
expert on New World monkeys, was using Huxley to scan specimens
ranging from individual teeth a few cubic millimeters in volume,
to entire primate skulls and, with the aid of a Silicon Graphics
Workstation, was creating extraordinarily accurate 3-D models.
 On screen he was able to take the models, rotate them any way
he desired, take measurements no one had taken before, cut sections
that would have destroyed the original specimen, and enlarge tiny,
all but invisible, details.  Such capabilities were transforming
his work in morphology, and almost daily producing new insights.
 The two of us had been brought together by Cissy Anklam, Director
of the Natural Partners Initiative of the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of Natural History to explore ways in which visualization
technologies could aid the Initiative in its mission to use telecommunications
technologies to make the collections of the Institution available
to schools and classrooms around the country. Dr. Rosenberger
and I talked about the potential of these digital specimens for
both research and education as they were made available via the
Internet.  By the end of the afternoon, the Digital  Darwins concept
had emerged.<BR>

<P>
Imagine, we asked ourselves: A child in the seventh grade in Tishomingo
County Mississippi finds a small animal skull in her school yard.
 What is it? The encyclopedia requires that she perform a preliminary
identification in order to read about it.  Where can she take
it to find out?  The local Natural History Museum?--The nearest
one is hundreds of miles away.  The scientists at the university?--They
would love to help but simply don't have the time to answer
every question from every young person (and what common "skull
language" would they share in order to converse anyway?).
 She takes it to her teacher who thinks it is a rodent skull but
is not sure.  So teacher and student take it into their science
classroom, use a small probe digitizer and digital camera to trace
and photograph the surface of the skull, and create their own
3-D model on the classroom's desktop computer.  They then
use the same computer to access the Smithsonian's web site
where they navigate to Digital Darwins.  A few mouse clicks get
them to a section on mammals where they find a bat skull that
seems similar to their specimen.  With a few more mouse clicks
they superimpose their model on the Smithsonian's and identify
some important anomalies.  They e-mail the Digital Darwins webmaster
and attach a file representing their model.  A few days later
they get an e-mail back, this time from a mammology curator, saying
that they appear to have found a new species of bat.  Can they
send the entire skull to the museum for a taxonomic study?<BR>

<P>
Our next stop was the Office of Imaging and Photographic Services
at the National Museum of National History.  There, Carl Hansen,
Branch Chief, was experimenting with digital photography and Web-based
research archives, and was anxious to apply QuickTimeVR technology
to his work.  Carl had photographed a cast of an Australopithecus
skull and asked if we could create a QTVR movie.  With this work
we understood that 3-D modeling, together with QTVR and similar
digital imaging, represented a powerful medium for research and
education.<BR>

<P>
Digital Darwins is a collaborative effort to develop an artifact
based learning and knowledge exchange environment which may be
accessed and navigated electronically.  It is a set of Web resources
built around three-dimensional computer representations of museum
artifacts relating to natural history, and specifically to the
origins of humanity and human culture.  The project's principal
investigators are: Dr. Alfie Rosenberger, Director of the BioVisualization
Lab at the Smithsonian Institution, Carl Hansen, Branch Chief,
Office of Imaging and Photographic Services, National Museum of
Natural History, and myself,  Charles Calvo, Director of Research,
School of Architecture, Mississippi State University.  Together,
this collaboration represents expertise in Anthropology, archival
photography and digital documentation, and three-dimensional computer
visualization. The <A HREF="http://digitaldarwins.sarc.msstate.edu/">Digital Darwins Web site</A> (http://digitaldarwins.sarc.msstate.edu)
was a pilot project, which debuted to coincide with the Smithsonian's
150th anniversary in August 1996, to demonstrate 1) the application
of 3-D modeling and visualization to the study of museum objects,
and 2) the viability of the Internet as a delivery medium for
virtual museum material.<BR>

<P>
<H3>Digital Darwins Goals</H3>
<P>
The appeal of three-dimensional libraries to students, and their
potential impact, is represented by a simple analogy: the museum.
 While it is often difficult to engage students in the study of
history or archaeology when material is presented in the abstract
as text, or dates or as unknown, unseen locations, the museum,
which presents the same subject matter, remains a popular and
powerful informal education resource.  Students (and parents)
are engaged by the ability to view actual objects presented in
a context which provides connections to other objects, images
and supporting material.  As these same museums provide opportunities
for visitors to interact directly with material they expand the
capacity to learn through object-based experiences.  Three-dimensional
computer models of museum artifacts, delivered with tools which
allow for their manipulation and comparison, have that same power,
and are truly capable of turning the classroom experience into
a museum experience.  Through creating such an experience the
Digital Darwins project and its spin-offs seek to:
<UL>
<LI>apply new understandings about the potential of electronic
archives of museum artifacts, and especially 3D artifacts, to
engage students in a quest for knowledge;
<LI>use technology as a means of opening doors to knowledge by
inspiring students to ask questions, make comparisons and connections;
<LI>develop the Internet as a resource for the exploration of
natural science, including archaeological, historical and cultural
material;
<LI>create an environment where students and teachers can contribute
to the Internet resources available and interact with the researchers
and scientists generating the material; and
<LI>provide a means by which students and teachers may communicate
with their counterparts in other parts of their region, country
and the world regarding the material they are exploring and generating.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The overall goal of Digital Darwins is to leverage visualization
technology together with the Internet to increase interest in
and learning of science, technology and natural history among
students, in both formal and informal learning environments. 
Digital Darwins is accomplishing this goal through the creation
of a science, technology and natural history education environment
that is graphically-based: able to engage students immediately
without language hurdles; asynchronous: allowing the student to
proceed through material at his/her own pace; project and discovery
oriented: providing the means for students to make their own connections
and develop their own insights; collaborative: enabling students
to communicate their finds with others and to share in common
discovery based activities, and open ended: able to be continuously
expanded and updated, both by the project developers and by the
students themselves.<BR>

<P>
Skulls, bones and other remains; archaeological material like
pottery, arrowheads, and jewelry; historical material like patent
models, cultural artifacts or icons; and ultimately archival material
like drawings of unbuilt or ruined engineering works, all serve
as resources from which visualizations are created and for which
background information is being prepared.  Thus a student will
be able, for example, to:
<UL>
<LI>view a QTVR movie of Martha, the last American passenger pigeon,
which may be rotated so she may be viewed from any position, or
enlarged to show the feathers in more detail, and learn about
her life and death, the extinction of passenger pigeons, and the
problems of species loss world-wide;
<LI>view a simulation of the process of flint knapping to produce
stone tools recreated with actual flint nodules, each stage of
which may be viewed from any position around the nodule, and learn
about the people, on this continent and others, who used such
tools, what they hunted, how they lived and died;
<LI>view a wolf head, which may be rotated or enlarged, and from
which the fur can dissolve away to reveal the musculature and
finally the skull; compare the wolf skull with a dog's
or fox's, and learn about the reintroduction of Canadian
wolves into formerly native habitats, and the accompanying debate
about species affiliation;
<LI>view and interact with a reverse engineered model of the original
Morse telegraph, and learn about other forms of long distance
communication which preceed the Internet, like the semaphore towers
of France, or hear a message transmitted in Morse code; or
<LI> see and move through a bridge design by a 19th century railway
engineer and learn about the role of the railroads in the opening
of the American West; and  
<LI>draw such connections as how the Morse telegraph aided the
rail-based expansion, the impact of that expansion on Native American
populations, the results of settlement and ranching on local wolf
population, and ultimately on the extinction of such species as
the passenger pigeon;
</UL>

<P>
and in each case these students may communicate with their peers
around the country about their common discoveries through e-mail,
or through the construction of their own Web sites describing
their own local correlates to what they have seen and learned.
<BR>

<P>
<H3>Digital Darwins Technology</H3>
<P>
Current technology for three-dimensional computer representation
provides a powerful tool for researchers concerned with the specimens
of natural science and history, and provides an equally powerful
means to engage students in the study of human history, culture
and diversity.  The development of three-dimensional libraries
of the artifacts of natural history and human culture, and the
development of software tools with which those artifacts may be
compared and manipulated will provide researchers and students
with opportunities for knowledge development and exchange not
heretofore possible.  Because of their tangibility, and because
of the potential for students to experience manipulating the simulated
object directly, these representations offer students the opportunity
to engage in a hands-on study of the processes and products of
natural science barely one step removed from fieldwork itself.
 In the study of the natural history there can be little doubt
that a continuous, intuitive, multi-sensory, interactive experience
is more appropriate and empowering than the abstraction of information
and rote memorization. <BR>

<P>
The world of three-dimensional computer imagery is no longer limited
to the movie screen or to high-performance workstations.  Effective
development of three-dimensional models and animations is possible
on desktop computers through such technologies as VRML (Virtual
Reality Markup Language), QuickDraw3D, and QuickTimeVR.  Similarly,
networked communication is no longer limited to universities and
research institutions.  The Internet has become a popular and
effective means of transmitting text, graphics, video, voice and
other data, albeit at varying rates of speed.  However, the combination
of 3-D visualization and the Internet, while possible, presents
some challenges.<BR>

<P>
Three-dimensional computer representations of common objects may
be presented in one of two ways.  First, actual 3-D geometry may
be described, often as a series of triangular surfaces, which
may be processed by the computer in order to create a shaded image
of the object.  The appearance of the surfaces may be enhanced
through the description of textures or through the application
of texture maps--in effect decals of photographs of material wrapped
onto the computer model.  Second, an array of photographs may
be created, representing the object from all sides in high levels
of detail. Moving a mouse or pointing device instructs the computer
to display images in sequence, creating a simulation of rotating
or moving the actual object. Apple's QuickTimeVR is the
most common version of this approach. <BR>

<P>
3-D geometry has the advantage of simulating the actual object,
creating in effect a virtual specimen or artifact that can be
measured, sliced through, or viewed from any point, inside or
out.  It has the disadvantage of requiring processing power to
generate each and every image.  File sizes for geometry may be
relatively small or large depending on how finely the geometry
is described.  Arrays of photographs do not require processing
power, only display, but require large amounts of storage. Indeed
storage requirements increase--often dramatically--with the level
of detail or resolution required, and as one photograph must be
stored for each simulated viewing position.  Both forms of data
may be transmitted via the Internet; geometry usually results
in smaller file sizes but requires software and processing power
to visualize; arrays of photographs may be visualized very easily
but are often measured in megabytes of file size and are therefore
slow to deliver.<BR>

<P>
A variety of means are be used to generate the data for 3-D visualizations.
A 3-D laser scanner, capable of sampling up to 150 points per
square millimeter, records geometry, form and volume.  High resolution
digital photographs record surface textures, colors and fine detail.
 These, and similar technologies are available providing lower
levels of resolution and correspondingly lower prices.  Digitizers
include electromagnetic, acoustic stylus, and rigid and servo-mechanical
devices, which start at under $3,000; laser light stylus, single
and multiple point devices, costing up to $80,000.  Digital cameras
also range in price, from a few hundred dollars to close to $20,000
for museum quality.  A classroom may be reasonably equipped with
a probe digitizer and digital camera for under $3,500. <BR>

<P>
Once data has been collected, visualizations may be created in
several ways.  The scanning software which accompanies Huxley,
Dr. Rosenberger's laser digitizer, like that for most digitization
devices, was developed for industry rather than natural science.
 While it is able to locate points on the surface of an object
with remarkable accuracy, recreating the full object requires
intimate knowledge of the relations between points. It is these
relations which define the surfaces and which also require significant
human intervention in the interpretation of the scanned data.
 Skulls, with their complex convolutions, demand careful editing
by persons with some familiarity with anatomy.  While a probe
digitizer would not require the same level of editing, it would
also not deliver anywhere near the level of accuracy of the laser
instrument.  Once an accurate model is created, textures may be
assigned to simulate surface qualities, and the geometry rendered.
 By creating views and storing images from around the object,
QuickTimeVR movies may be produced.  By converting the geometry
into other formats, the file may be transferred to other software
to create, for instance, a VRML or QuickDraw3D model.<BR>

<P>
QuickTimeVR movies are also created through digital photography.
 The object is carefully mounted and placed against a color background,
and recorded with a digital camera which stores images electronically
and allows those files to be downloaded to a computer.  The images
are edited, removing the mounting mechanism, cleaning up the background,
and increasing contrast or brightness and adjusting color balance
as appropriate.  The images may then be scaled down, or compressed
if required for the transfer medium, and combined to create a
QTVR object movie.<BR>

<P>
The Digital Darwins project has been experimenting with the capabilities
of Apple's QuickTimeVR format in order to expand the potential
of this medium to create interactive experiences.  The QuickTimeVR
object format is essentially a two dimensional array of images,
where a conventional movie is one dimensional.  Work done at MSU's
Digital Research and Imaging Lab in the School of Architecture
exploited this two-dimensional structure to look at buildings.
 We found that we could, for example, use one dimension--the horizontal
movement of the mouse--to navigate around a building, while we
could use the other--vertical movement--to zoom in for a closer
look.  Similarly we created QTVRs where we could move around a
university campus and change the time of day to see the pattern
of shadows created from any position, or could move through a
model of the restored galleries of the National Museum of National
History with the ability to look left or right at any point in
our journey.  These experiments convinced us that we could apply
these two dimensions of freedom to significant benefit with the
Digital Darwins material.  While these applications have just
begun, they include the ability to morph between two specimens,
as well as the ability to pass a plane through a specimen to reveal
its cross section at various points.  Work in development includes
showing the sequence of flint flaking used to produce Neolithic
tools, dissolving the fur and musculature away from a mammal head
to reveal the skull or, similarly, building up the musculature
and skin on a hominid skull to recreate the face of an early ancestor.
<BR>

<P>
In addition, we have been experimenting with stereo imaging. 
Various strategies exist for simulating the appearance of depth
by projecting slightly different images to each eye.  Like the
creation of 3-D simulations themselves, these methods may use
processing power, or may rely on pre-processed imagery.  In either
case, images are developed--or recorded--representing the view
seen from each eye, in effect with cameras separated by an average
interoccular distance.  In order to develop the means to deliver
stereo imagery over the Internet we have looked at two forms of
image delivery to the eyes: alternating left and right eye images,
and red/blue anaglyph stereo pairs.  As alternating left and right
eye images require synchronizing the computer monitor with a pair
of goggles--the monitor projects alternating images up to sixty
times a second and the goggles alternately occlude each eye--and
therefore still demand somewhat sophisticated software, we have,
for the moment chosen to develop red/blue pairs.  This form of
stereo projection recalls the B-movie genre of the 1950s, but
is extremely economical: glasses cost less than $.50 each in small
lots.  <BR>

<P>
As Digital Darwins embraces both research and education, various
strategies for transmission of  3-D visualizations are being actively
explored.  Research quality files can be quite large.  Digital
photographs recorded at 600 dots per inch and 24 bit color resolution
requires a megabyte or more of storage depending upon format.
 Compression schemes can reduce file size, but can also result
in some data loss.  Geometry files, especially when recording
data at densities of 150 points per square millimeter, can result
in file sizes which rapidly bring all but the most powerful workstations
to their knees.  Because of the demand placed on networks when
exchanging such extremely large data sets, we are experimenting
with alternative network solutions.  Currently we have an ATM
(asynchronous transfer mode) network testbed up and running between
the Smithsonian and several sites around the country.  This network
is capable of carrying 145 mega-bits per second, three times greater
than current technology.  Plans for Internet 2, and the vision
articulated by the President in his State of the Union address,
suggest that our present work with research quality material will
be well supported by next generation networks.  At the moment
however, the Internet still serves a valuable role beyond 3-D
file transmission.<BR>

<P>
The value of the Internet as a communication and information delivery
medium is that it is constantly changing.  Participants in chat
rooms may sign on and leave at any time, e-mail may be accessed
from various sites, Web pages can be updated, added to or modified
at will.  This medium is well suited to the delivery of background,
context, and related information to support the three-dimensional
objects and specimens.  This material can undergo expansion and
refinement as students, teachers, researchers and scientists add
new links, references, curricular material and data.  More importantly
for Digital Darwins, the Internet may be used to deliver software
tools--through JAVA for example--or to provide access to processing
power - as demonstrated by the Fusion 3-D component of the Digital
Darwins project which allowed users to request customized visualizations
created on the site's server.  <BR>

<P>
The Internet may also serve as an effective medium for evaluation
of certain aspects of project effectiveness.  Web sites may contain
simple devices such as counters to indicate the number of &euml;hits'
the site receives, or may contain questionnaire sections, allowing
a user to sign on by answering a series of questions designed
to gather pertinent information.  Users may be tracked and surveyed
at different points to assess changes in knowledge, perception
and attitude as the result of interaction with the material. Students
and teachers will be able to communicate with their peers through
e-mail, chat-rooms and, as the project grows, through desktop
video conferencing, as well as being able to communicate with
science experts.  At the Smithsonian Institution, for example,
web delivery of objects will be integrated with "scientists
in the classroom" discussions via the Natural Partners Initiative
Electronic Classroom.<BR>

<P>
<H3>BENEFITS</H3>
<P>
Digital Darwins will provide access to museum collections, knowledge
and discovery-based learning to students in districts which traditionally
struggle to encourage learning in the sciences, technology and
natural history.  Classrooms in Digital Darwins schools will be
able to become museums, and Digital Darwins students will operate
as researchers and scientists.<BR>

<P>
The need for stimulating students about science in the early years
of their education is clear.  The 1983 report <I>Educating Americans
for the 21st Century</I> identified as a goal that:

<BLOCKQUOTE>By 1995, the Nation must provide, for all its youth, a level of
mathematics, science, and technology education that is the finest
in the world, without sacrificing the American birthright of equity
and opportunity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Fourteen years later the evidence suggests that this goal has
not been achieved.  In a comparison of mathematics and science
achievement scores internationally it has been found that U.S.
students rank below those of most other industrialized nations.
In science in particular, average 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>achievement of U.S. 9-year-olds is not significantly lower than
that of any other nation, and is significantly higher than the
achievement of Slovenia and Ireland.  Among the 13-year-olds,
however, the average science achievement of U.S. students is not
significantly higher than any country and is significantly lower
than the achievement of Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland and Hungary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<I> U.S. Science and Engineering in a Changing World, NSF 1996</I>
<P>
These findings are supported by data from the National Assessment
of Educational Progress (NAEP) which indicates that
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a)verage proficiency scores in science fell in the 1970s, then
began to rise after 1977 for students at ages 9 and 13.  By 1990,
the average scores of students in both of these age groups had
returned to their 1970 levels.  Scores for students at age 17
continued to drop until 1982 - a 22-point drop over the period
- then regained some ground.  Their scores in 1990 remained still
significantly below the 1970 level.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Education reform efforts have identified a number of elements
leading to increased learning--especially of advanced or higher-level
skills, enhanced student motivation and self-concept.  These include
student exploration, interactive modes of instruction, extended
blocks of authentic and multi-disciplinary work, collaborative
work and performance-based assessment.  Studies of the use of
instructional technologies have shown that, when used in ways
that are compatible with these elements, "technology supports
exactly the kinds of changes in content, roles, organizational
climate, and affect that are at the heart of the reform movement."
(<I>Using Technology to Support Education Reform - Sept. 1993</I>)
<BR>

<P>
When used for exploratory learning, technology allows students
to direct their own assimilation of facts, concepts and procedures
through a process of discovery.  Exploratory learning technologies
have included electronic databases, computer-based exploratory
applications and video exploratory applications.  Three problems
in particular have been identified in the development of exploratory
applications: 1) Scarcity: they have been expensive to develop,
so few are available; 2) Low return: they are difficult to match
to the curriculum of enough schools to establish a broad market
base; and 3) Time limited value: they tend to have a short shelf-life
as students learn the lessons of the material and desire to move
on.  Digital Darwins is applying exploratory technology to develop
students' learning, motivation and interest in science,
technology and natural history with particular attention to the
three problems identified above.<BR>

<P>
Digital Darwins is a pilot program intended, in part, to demonstrate
how the resources of the nation's museums may be made available
electronically, in cost effective ways.  Several numeric indicators
are worth noting.  The National Museum of Natural History contains
some 120,000,000 objects, of which only about 1% are on display
at any time.  Costs to dismantle an exhibit and reconstruct a
new one in order to display new material run up to $500 per square
foot.  Traditional museum display, as the sole means of access
to museum collections, is extremely expensive. Two-dimensional
digitization projects have demonstrated the economy of this method
of preservation and information exchange.  Harvard University,
for instance, has converted some 80,000 posters from its Judaica
holdings at a cost of about $2.00 each.  It is estimated, based
upon actual work such as Digital Darwins, that the time involved
in preparing a 3-D visualization file of a moderately sized object
can be reduced to as little as an hour and no more than one person-day,
and that the costs of preparing background material for Web publication
are equivalent to any other publication form, while the actual
costs of publication, revision and distribution are much lower.
 <BR>

<P>
Value (cost) may be better calculated by examining impact.  In
this case, the cost of the program might be reasonably compared
with the cost of transporting a rural student to a science, technology
or natural history museum.  Though not intended as a substitute
for such a trip, Digital Darwins provides a powerful supplement
as its materials are available to the student, in his/her classroom
(or home), at any time.<BR>

<P>
The problem of curriculum match and market base results in part
from the elaborate and specific nature of many simulation based
exploratory technologies.  In its full development, Digital Darwins
will not be one large simulation, but a collection of small simulations
each with multiple links allowing it to be tied to existing curricula
in various ways.  In addition, it is intended to be effective
enough in cost and delivery to allow market development in manners
not dependent on curriculum, for instance through the school library
or home markets.  Finally, Digital Darwins value will not be time
limited.  Two means exist inherent in the structure of the project
to allow constant re-energizing of the material.  First, the project
envisions the addition of 3-D visualizations to the collection
at regular intervals. Second, the Web-based support system provides
a means by which new tools, background, context and related material
can be made available to enrich and enliven existing 3-D collections.
<BR>

<P>
<H3>Conclusions</H3>
<P>
The Digital Darwins project is unique in that it applies technology
with clear value to basic research to develop a body of materials
and resources for use in K-12 classrooms and informal education
settings around the nation. The teaming of researchers with students,
through a common database of archival material and a common set
of tools for investigating and adding to the archive, is a model
for collaborative work which engages young people in real research
and in real problems.  There is no question that our youth are
fully capable of making significant contributions to research
and knowledge if only given the opportunities and tools.  Projects
involving Digital Darwins partners, such as EarthVision and work
at the Bergen County Academy for the Advancement of Science and
Technology--a New Jersey magnet school, are powerful demonstrations
of their capacity. The model of using 3D computer technology for
the representation, investigation and distribution of important
material may be applied to subject matter ranging from archaeological
artifacts, to biological specimens, to manufactured objects, as
well as to the history of art.  The Web interface being developed
is a model for utilizing the Internet as a significant tool for
education and the exchange of knowledge which supplements traditional
curricula and publication.<BR>

<P>
Publication of museum material, archaeological material for example,
is constrained by the cost of publication. Researchers working
with original material are not able to publish full collections,
and researchers or students seeking information about collections
are not able to find full visual documentation.  Research and
learning is further constrained by problems of access to specimens.
 Important materials are often fragile and precious, and cannot
easily be lent.  Traditional publication processes mean it is
often years between the time of the discovery of important information
and its publication, and therefore its general availability.<BR>

<P>
Limited availability of images and information about artifacts
not only compromises the advancement of knowledge directly, indirect
compromise results as well.  One cannot imagine the number of
artifacts, pottery shards, stone tools, figurines, etc. which
have been lost to the study of the evolution of human culture
because those who found them had neither context nor means by
which to identify them as something of scholarly or other value.
 The production of libraries of three-dimensional computer models
of archaeological and museum artifacts, especially when those
libraries represent current work in the field, offers researchers
a means to generating and exchanging new knowledge which may reasonably
compared wit
