<h2>At Home in the Heartland Online:<br> forming a
museum/school resource via the World Wide Web</h2>




<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In February of 1996 I was employed by the Illinois State Museum (ISM) to
help create the online exhibit <i>At Home in the Heartland Online</i>. I am
a museum educator with experience in designing computer-aided instructional
programs. Today I'll talk about what I have learned about creating a
successful collaboration among three very different learning
environments--the World Wide Web, the museum exhibit, and the
classroom--and the people who work in these environments. I hope to
contribute two things to this conference on museums and the web: an
understanding of the complexities involved in bringing these three learning
environments together; inspiration for other museum professionals to
consider the Web as a dynamic vehicle for educational outreach into the
classroom.
</p>


<h3>Background History</h3>


<p>
In the fall of 1995 the Illinois State Museum applied to Ameritech's
&quot;Distance Learning Application Program for Arts and Cultural
Organizations.&quot; Ameritech was looking for programs that would utilize
telecommunications technology for any number of outreach efforts to the
public:
</p>


<ul>
	<li>Planning and training for virtual field trips led by museum
curators
	<li>Real-time interaction between teachers, students and the
performing arts
	<li>Accessing and exploring collections and archives via the Internet
	<li>Integrating school-based curricula with distance learning
visits to museums
</ul>



<p>
The ISM proposed to create an online exhibit based on the museum's popular
history exhibit At Home in the Heartland.  The online exhibit would
establish links and educational partnerships among Ameritech, the museum,
and Illinois public schools by integrating museum resources with school
curricula in grades 3 - 12. Students would have the opportunity to access
and study museum collections and archives through the online exhibit.
Primary source materials specific to Illinois are not readily available to
Illinois school children as they begin their study of American history.
</p>


<p>
The scope and breadth of this &quot;pioneering effort at cultural inquiry
and interpretation&quot; was accepted and the museum received over
$100,000. Ameritech's support meant that the ISM had 12 months to hire
needed staff and create an online exhibit which would represent 300 years
of Illinois history through six separate modules, contain hundreds of
objects and images associated with family life in Illinois and domestic
material culture, and include narratives of men and women who had lived in
Illinois.
</p>


<h4>Realizing the Project</h4>



The &quot; core team&quot; consisted of the curator of decorative arts, a
museum educator, and a website developer. In 10 months this team, assisted
by a graphic artist, dozens of public school teachers, tech coordinators,
and a five-person teacher advisory board created <i>At Home in the
Heartland Online</i>.  What are the particulars of this complex resource
for Illinois students? At 30 megabytes large the website contains:


<ul>
	<li>over a hundred images

	<li>a dozen sound files

	<li>narratives covering 300 years of history

	<li>inquiry questions and suggested classroom activities based on
the narratives

	<li>three different levels of complexity to address the
developmental needs of students grades 3 - 12

	<li>&quot;The Convoy&quot;--a role-playing game involving the
convoy of bateaux which journeyed between New Orleans and the upper
Illinois colonies in the 1700s

	<li>&quot;Livre's Worth&quot;--an interactive math game based on
the barter economy of French Illinois

	<li>&quot;Behind the Scenes&quot;--an interactive object-based
activity to introduce students to the process of scientific inquiry used by
archaeologists and material culture historians
</ul>





<p>
<i>At Home in the Heartland Online</i> went public December 31, 1996 and
has been a success. How has success been measured?
</p>


<ul>
	<li>by the results of a formative evaluation conducted by outside
evaluators

	<li>in continued financial support by Ameritech to help fund the
creation of an educational poster about the online exhibit, a written
teacher guide, and teacher training sessions on using the website with
students in the classroom

	<li>through anecdotal feedback from website users from both the
museum community and the education community
</ul>

<p>
The following comments are from the guestbook:
</p>


<pre>
This is really the first interactive web site I have found for a social studies
unit. Our third grades are doing a pioneer days unit and this is perfect. I
hope
more sites like this will become available in the future. This is an excellent
site and deserves and A+.
Eldorado, IL USA - Tuesday, March 04, 1997


I'm really impressed! I have just started &quot;playing&quot; on the Internet.
This is wonderful for the Illinois unit which is done in fourth grade. My
students will love it if we ever get linked. Thanks for a great job!
Western Springs, IL USA - Saturday, February 08, 1997


This is a terrific resource for teachers! I've added a link to my own
Educator's
Resource page.
Pittsburgh, PA USA - Tuesday, January 28, 1997


This is a wonderful resource for those of us who teach Illinois History. I have
been doing so for nearly a quarter of a century, so I appreciate the work that
brought this to fruition. Congratulations on your achievement!
Coal City, IL USA - Thursday, January 09, 1997


What a great combination of activities for a wide range of student age groups!
This will certainly be part of the future in educational home pages. The format
was not only easily understood but also easy to follow for students as well.
Thanks for the contribution to our classrooms!
Lansing, IL USA - Monday, January 06, 1997

<h3>Collaboration is Key</h3>


<p>
<i>At Home in the Heartland Online</i> represents the successful
collaboration among three very different and unique learning
environments--the Web, the museum exhibit, and the classroom. Each of these
environments has its own limitations vis a vis the other two; each has its
own distinct features as a learning environment; each has played a unique
role in the project; and each has its own content expert.
</p>


<p>
The content experts brought their special set of skills and knowledge to
the project:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The web developer knew how to write and design web pages. He
was familiar with basic design tenets that are considered standard within
the online community.

	<li>The museum curator had created the physical exhibit. She had
contacts within the community of Illinois historians and could draw on
their historical expertise when creating new content for the website.

	<li>The classroom teachers understood their students' needs and
could best envision how <i>At Home in the Heartland Online</i> could be
integrated into their curriculum.
</ul>


<p>
With the help of liaisons--the graphic artist, the museum educator, and
technology coordinators from several public school districts--the content
experts were able to express their needs and opinions with regard to the
development of the online exhibit in a non-threatening and collaborative
way.
</p>

<p>
To understand the alchemy that took place in the creation of <i>At Home in
the Heartland Online</i>, consider the following analysis of the three
different learning environments which came together in creating the
website; followed by an identification of the different skills, needs, and
perspectives brought by the content experts and liaisons from the
brainstorming stage to theend result.
</p>


<h3>The Three Learning Environments</h3>


<h4>The Web is the medium</h4>



<p>
The World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypermedia information retrieval system which
runs on the Internet and supports images, sound and video. It is part of
the Internet, a network that has evolved over the last two decades to
connect millions of computers around the world. It is accessed through a
computer and a modem or a dedicated high band-width phone line ( T1 line).
</p>

<p>
As a learning environment the Web is defined by the following characteristics:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>two-dimensional
	<li>multi-layered
	<li>interconnected
	<li>global
	<li>self-directed
</ul>

<b>Two-dimensional</b>


<p>
Confined to being viewed on a computer screen the Web is a two-dimensional
learning environment. The greatest conceptual challenge the core
team--curator, web developer, and museum educator--faced was how to distill
a three-dimensional learning experience (the physical museum exhibit) into
a two-dimensional space (the computer screen)--without losing complexity or
meaning.
</p>



<b>Multi-layered</b>


<p>
Hypermedia allows one to develop interlinking layers of information. A
website can be organized to have a certain flow from the general to the
more detailed or from one topic to other topics. The user is able to
structure a website in much the same way one would organize a museum
exhibit. A museum exhibit presents information to the visitor in visual
layers which move from the general and visually prominent--objects, exhibit
titles, and wall didactives--to the more detailed and less visually
obvious--object labels.  In a website users direct their path by clicking
on icons, images, or &quot;hot&quot; text to take them from layer to layer.
</p>


<p>
Designing the exhibit content to make the best use of the Web's flexibility
and hypermedia capability was a great challenge. The team felt that it was
important to allow learners to choose their own path through the content.
At the same time it was clear that there would need to be different paths
for teachers, lower school students, middle school students, and high
school students.
</p>


<b>Interconnected and Global</b>



<p>
A website has the ability to be interconnected.  <i>At Home in the
Heartland Online</i> is designed to allow for links between the different
areas of content within each time period. Each area of information has its
own icon. These icons are used to provide paths through the material. For
example, a visitor in the maps section can visit objects by clicking on the
objects icon at the bottom of the screen (see: <a
href="http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/athome/1950/maps/index.html">athome
/1950/maps/index.html</a> and <a
href="http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/athome/1950/maps/index.html">athome
/1950/maps/hownavig.htm</a>). Appropriate links to other websites are
provided where they will complement this online resource, making it a
global resource. From <i>At Home in the Heartland Online</i>, a visitor can
go to many other websites in the country and the world.
</p>


<b>Self Directed</b>


<p>
Like a museum exhibit, a website is a self-directed learning environment.
Visitor have the ability to choose a path through the material.
</p>


<h4>The exhibit provides the content</h4>


<p>
The physical exhibit, <i>At Home in the Heartland</i>, utilizes the
domestic material culture collections of the ISM, documentary collections
gleaned from over 140 historical collections in the state, and oral
histories gathered for the project. It is an innovative effort to involve
people with the objects of home and family life through simulated
situations involving choice. In the gallery, these stories are represented
by multi-media, touch-screen presentations. The visitor listens to the
narrative of a person facing a life choice and participates in their
decision-making. The narratives are based on historical records, oral
histories, diaries, and letters reworked into a mini-drama by a playwright
and read by actors and actresses. Other aspects of the physical exhibit
include: timelines, maps, &quot;side by side&quot; which are cultural
comparisons, and &quot;clues to the past&quot; which examine how historians
recreate the past through primary source materials such as estate
inventories, newspapers, family account books, catalogs, magazines,
photographs, and oral interviews.
</p>


<p>
In order to be a useful classroom resource the content of the online
exhibit had to complement the different curriculum needs of both elementary
and high school aged students.
</p>


<h4>Teachers and students are the classroom</h4>


<p>
A classroom is a physical space animated by the interaction of students and
teachers. Depending on the age group, a classroom may be a
multidisciplinary learning space as in the case of the lower school; or in
the case of the upper school, a classroom may be specialized to provide
resources in one academic discipline alone. A classroom may be organized to
support group learning and/or individual learning. Some classrooms have
many resources around the edges of the room--reference books, reading
materials, maps, insects, animals, plants, and computers. Other classrooms
are organized according to the resources needed to pursue a particular
study, i.e., a biology lab. In all classrooms it is the quality of the
relationship that exists between the teacher and students that has the
greatest implications for learning.
</p>



<p>
A successful classroom resource must enhance the relationship between
teachers and students by being flexible enough to be used in a variety of
ways, yet specific enough to address the curriculum needs of the different
age groups.
</p>



<p>
The challenge was to create an online exhibit that could be used in a
number of ways:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>as a whole group activity with all the students participating
and the teacher leading the activity

	<li>as a station activity, part of a series of activities with a
central theme

	<li>by individual students as a resource similar to a reference
book with primary source documents
</ul>

<p>
This type of multiple use in the classroom depends on the design of the
website, the presentation of the content, and the flexibility of the
teacher. Equally important is the addition of curriculum-based lesson
plans, activities, and inquiry that address student and teacher needs,
testing standards, and basic skills development for the students.
</p>


<h3>Content Experts and Liaisons</h3>


Designing an educational website destined for elementary and secondary
school classrooms is an exercise in communication. An online exhibit like
<i>At Home in the Heartland Online</i> is as much a partnership among the
curator of the exhibit, the museum educator, and classroom teachers as it
is between the web developer and the schools. Illinois public school
teachers, administrators, and technology coordinators were involved from
the outset in helping the core team--curator, web developer, and museum
educator--design <i>At Home in the Heartland Online</i>. The team knew that
if the online exhibit were to become a successful classroom resource it
would have to address the needs and interests of teachers and students. The
only way to find out what these needs were was by involving the intended
audience in the design of the website.


<h4>The different roles of the design team</h4>


<p>
The <b>curator</b> had supervised the process of creating the physical
exhibit and now supervised the development of the online exhibit. She
edited the modules as they were created by the web developer and museum
educator, using her knowledge of Illinois history and the exhibit content
to correct errors or suggest changes. She was also the primary liaison with
the granting agency.
</p>


<p>
The <b>web developer</b> created the structure and organization of the
website. He was the exhibits department. Instead of paint, wood and nails,
he used BBedit, Photoshop, scanners, and a computer.
</p>


<p>
The <b>museum educator</b> brainstormed how to make <i>At Home in the
Heartland Online</i> an educational resource for the classroom. She enlisted the help of teachers throughout Illinois in this process and acted as a liais
on among the curator, web developer, and these teachers. Her discoveries
about teacher needs and use of technology in the classroom affected the
overall design of the website. She developed suggested activities and
inquiry questions to take the website out into the classroom and give
teachers a structure for using the resource.
</p>


<p>
The <b>graphic artist</b> worked with the core team to create the main
image for the homepage (a homepage is similar to a book-cover and table of
contents) and the icons for the different content areas. He helped to
create a &quot;look&quot; for the website.
</p>


<p>
The <b>tech coordinators</b> from several of the most progressive school
districts in Illinois got involved in the project by invitation from the
museum educator. They created opportunities for the team to introduce <i>At
Home in the Heartland Online</i> to teachers during summer technology
workshops. They saw the project as a partnership between their schools and
the ISM. Three of these districts named the museum as part of a learning
consortium of institutions involved in helping to raise the quality of
education for students in their districts.
</p>



<p>
The <b>Teacher Advisory Board</b> was selected by the museum educator and
paid a small stipend from the grant. The board consisted of two lower
school teachers--a resource teacher for gifted 4th &amp; 5th graders and a
4th grade teacher, two middle school teachers--a 6th grade social studies
and language arts teacher and a 7th &amp; 8th grade social studies and
geography teacher, and a high school teacher--11th grade American Studies.
</p>


<p>
A <b>formative evaluation</b> of the website was designed by the same
company that had evaluated the physical exhibit--People, Places and Design.
The purpose of the evaluation was to record how the website was being used
by students and teachers in the classroom and to measure if learning was
occurring. Based on their findings the evaluation team suggested ways to
improve the website.
</p>


<h4>The process of collaboration</h4>



<p>
The process of working together took place over three distinct phases. Each
phase correlated with a deadline that had been set by the grant. By
reviewing these phases it will become clear how the liaisons facilitated
interaction among the content experts.
</p>


<h3>Phase I</h3>


<h4>Arriving at a visual look</h4>



<p>
In Phase I, the graphic artist worked with the rest of the team to give
verbal ideas a visual look. It was decided that the homepage for the site
would be a colorful gameboard, borrowing from the colors of the exhibit but
using images of transportation to symbolize the different time periods
(see: <a
href="http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/athome/index.html">athome/index.htm
l</a>). The graphic artist developed this main image for the site, as well
as individual icons to represent secondary areas of information--maps,
timelines, &quot;side by side,&quot; objects, and &quot;clues to the
past.&quot; Additional icons were added for the website--&quot;teacher
resources&quot; and &quot;how to navigate&quot;  (see: <a
href="http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/athome/1950/index.html">athome/1950
/index.html</a> and <a
href="http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/athome/1950/hownavig.htm">athome/19
50/hownavig.htm</a>). Based on this organizational framework, the web
developer began to build the first module from the images and text that had
been used to create the physical exhibit.
</p>


<h4>Establishing a network of teacher contacts</h4>


<p>
The museum educator worked to establish contact with a wide-range of people
involved in the field of secondary education in Illinois. She worked to
raise interest in the project and find answers to questions concerning
curriculum and the use of technology in the Illinois public schools,
through:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>general phone interviews

	<li>visits with teachers and administrators in the Springfield
school district

	<li>e-mail contact with the Technology Hub directors for the Illinois
State Board of Ed.

	<li>joining the Springfield chapter of the Illinois Computing
Educators (spICE)
</ul>


<p>
The museum educator's findings resulted in the following decisions:
</p>


<ul>
	<li>to follow the chronology of the exhibit but focus the website
on the narratives (Voices &amp; Choices)

	<li>to create three levels of complexity as a way of organizing the
content and activities by grades--level one grades 3 - 5, level two grades
6 - 8, and level three grades 9 -12

	<li>to make the website as teacher friendly as possible by creating
a &quot;teacher resources&quot; icon where teachers could go for lesson
plans and other teacher specific materials
</ul>





<h3>Phase II</h3>


<h4>Summer workshops</h4>


<p>
The summer workshops were organized by the technology coordinators in
school districts with connections to the Internet. Most technology
coordinators see themselves as a part of the restructuring of public
education from the traditional classroom to a constructivist model. These
school districts had planned hands-on summer workshops to teach faculty
computer skills, including Internet skills. <i>At Home in the Heartland
Online</i>  served as an introduction to the World Wide Web and as an
example of the types of resources available through the Internet.
</p>


<p>
The &quot;At Home&quot; workshops were designed to:
</p>


<ul>
	<li>familiarize teachers with <i>At Home in the Heartland Online</i>

	<li>introduce teachers to the icons for navigating the website

	<li>model a 15 minute lesson using the website as the focus of the
lesson

	<li>encourage collaboration by having teachers work in small groups

	<li>exercise critical thinking and problem-solving skills

	<li>elicit teacher feedback on what they liked and disliked about
the website
</ul>





<h3>Phase III</h3>


<h4>Closure</h4>


<p>
The core team created the final five modules. These were based on the first
module which had been shown to teachers during the summer workshops and
modified to reflect their suggestions. The museum educator worked closely
with the Teacher Advisory Board to develop age-appropriate activities and
discussion questions for the website.
</p>


<p>
The advisory board felt that the learning goals and objectives for the
website must complement the Illinois State Board of Education's curriculum
mandates for social studies and language arts. Activities were designed to
help students develop critical thinking skills by involving students in
historical research and dramatic writing. The teacher advisors felt that it
was important for students to learn how to deal with primary sources,
create their own raw data, and analyze this data to reach a conclusion.
Many in-class activities use <i>At Home in the Heartland Online</i> as a
model for student products (see: <a
href="http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/athome/1950/TeachR/level3.htm">atho
me/1950/TeachR/level3.htm</a>).
</p>


<h4>Evaluation</h4>


<p>
It was apparent from the beginning that the evaluators were novice users of
the World Wide Web and the Internet. No effort was made to capitalize on
the Web medium and, for example, create an online questionnaire  to provide
additional data to that obtained through observation. The evaluation was
limited to classroom observation and the field tester relied on anecdotal
information to provide evidence of the online exhibit's educational value.
The question arises, when a museum designs a computer aided instructional
resource, such as an online exhibit, should it hire evaluators from the
museum field or from the field of instructional technology?
</p>


<p>
The  field tester observed one class of students at each of the three
levels-- a 4th grade class (level one), a 6th grade class (level two), and
a 10th grade class (level three)--over a six week period. Despite the
limited range of her study the field tester's findings did point to
problems that could be addressed, for example the need for a glossary of
vocabulary words. Moreover, she witnessed the realities and difficulties of
working with a resource that relies on emerging technologies. Based on her
findings she reported the following:
</p>


<ul>
	<li>The organization of the website, individual screens, and
navigation icons work for the students and teachers.

	<li>The 4th graders and some of the 6th graders are reading the
narratives at &quot;frustration level&quot; but enjoy the images and are
excited about using an Internet resource.

	<li>The 4th &amp; 6th grade teachers feel that the exhibit
addresses their curriculum needs by providing Illinois specific resources
tailored for the classroom.

	<li>The 10th graders feel that the narratives are too simplistic
but find the maps, timelines, &quot;side by side,&quot; &quot;clues to the
past,&quot; and objects useful as a social studies resource.

	<li>The 10th grade teacher is turned off to the website by repeated
problems getting online.

	<li>There is an overall frustration with connecting to the online
exhibit--sometimes the Internet is running and other times the Internet is
&quot;down&quot; and classes cannot connect.

	<li>Teachers feel reluctant to use a resource which is unreliable.
</ul>






<h3>In Conclusion</h3>



<p>
The time is ripe for museums to harness the power of the Web as a medium
for educational outreach. The technology exists to make the process of web
development fairly inexpensive and straightforward.  As tellecommunications
improve for the general population the Internet and WWW are becoming faster
and more reliable. Regional governments are pushing to connect public
schools to the Internet. The President has stated his commitment to provide
all students especially those in geographically isolated and  economically
depressed school districts with access to the &quot;information
superhighway.&quot; Two relatively new professions exist--the museum
educator and the technology coordinator--to facilitate the creation of
online educational resources by museums for schools.  Internet connectivity
has the potential to give students access to the types of resources museums
offer--authentic cultural and historical collections, scholarship and
primary source materials. Educational websites created by museums will find
favor with the education community, because they fill a need at no charge
to the visitor. Through its website <i>At Home in the Heartland Online</i>,
the Illinois State Museum fills such a need by providing classrooms and
households throughout the state of Illinois, America and the world with an
exciting and authentic resource on 300 years of family life in the
&quot;heartland&quot; of America.
