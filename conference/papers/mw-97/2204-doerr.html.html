<h2>The specialist seeks expert views: 
Managing digital folders in the AQUARELLE project</h2>
September, 1996<br>
Institute of Computer Science<br>
Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas<br>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The AQUARELLE project will connect researchers and museum specialists in
order to enable access to information describing and documenting the
European cultural heritage such as painting, sculptures, historical sites
and monuments, musical instruments and furniture. One of the main
objectives of AQUARELLE is to facilitate the creation and dissemination of
information folders and detailed catalogues. The management of cultural
information, related to a given theme or activity, in structured
collections, so-called folders, play a central role in the AQUARELLE
project.</p>

<p>In this paper we present the folder server and editing environment which
will support scholars, administrators and conservators to maintain
secondary SGML documents, that describe, comment and refer the primary
material (image or text bases etc.) across the European borders. The
technical challenge of this undertaking is to cater for the diversity in
specialization, organizational and cultural context, the data integrity and
the adequate high precision in reference and retrieval through the
Internet. On the other side, the organization of agreement on shared
contents and resources at all levels raises also interesting questions. The
project so far provides first solutions and serves moreover as a forum to
obtain valid requirements for future extensions.</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>The WWW attracts more and more the interest of museums and cultural
organizations as a means to project cultural contents, but as well as to
exchange information on an international level, addressing not only the
typical museum visitor but also the professional curator, documentalist or
scientist of any related discipline. The fact, that cultural spaces of the
past cross our modern borders, but even more the scattering of cultural
material objects all over the world, makes the possibility of
cost-efficient international data-exchange very attractive to the
professional community. See for instance the various locations of
"haystacks" by Monet or of the medieval bronze from Benin, Africa (e.g. <a
href="http://africa.itim.mi.cnr.it/"> http://africa.itim.mi.cnr.it</a>).</p>

<p>Current WWW technology provides the necessary standardization and global
communication structure, but existing tools are somehow limited to manage
documents in a professional framework (poor data structures, dangling
links, ad-hoc search engines, etc.). The AQUARELLE project (TELEMATICS
Application Program of the European Commission, Project IE-2005 1996),
relies on the fundamental concept of the Web and intends to provide a
reliable and precise access to heterogeneous cultural data sources within
an open federation of organizations for mutual benefit. According to the
AQUARELLE vision each author of a given information component should be
able to link directly a part of his own creation to another information
asset created and updated by another author in the Web. The organization of
cultural data into structured collections of primary material, called
"folders" (a translation of the French term "dossiers"), will bring much
more than a simple access to the existing information: linking and
commenting relevant pieces of information belonging to different owners
will add value to the information content itself. The overall AQUARELLE
architecture is designed to guarantee referential integrity as well as to
support the adequate high precision in reference and retrieval.</p>



<p>The AQUARELLE project has identified in an initial feasibility study
several examples of such folders: sets of pictures collected by a publisher
to edit a city guide; supporting documentation for exhibition preparation
by museum curators; collections of information elements on monuments and
sites at the "Inventaire General" of the French Ministry of Culture (<a
href="http://aquarelle.inria.fr/Inventaire">
http://AQUARELLE.inria.fr/Inventaire</a>). Depending on the purpose, these
collections may need considerable structuring in order to be useful.
Relations between collected or referred data and opinions, meanings, domain
knowledge, intended or actual use can be rather complex and will be
supported by the tools developed in the project. Folders themselves will be
a subject of data exchange, giving raise to a cooperative environment the
potential of which yet has to be explored.</p>

<p>The strong involvement of user groups in the project helped to identify
in a very early stage a series of important requirements specific to the
professional aspect of the systems to be developed. It was required to
provide high precision semantic indexing in fine granularity under the
control of high quality terminology, preferably multilingual, whereas
access by uncontrolled terms and data-mining aspects were regarded to be of
secondary importance. Rather than using a fixed data structure, specific
user groups need the possibility to customize their own data structures in
the running system on demand. Finally, it was ranked high to have reliable
metadata, especially on database contents.</p>

<p>AQUARELLE has finished the first design phase and it expects to present
the first prototype implementation in early spring this year. Being a
Technical Integration Project, it is going to solve with first priority the
questions of interoperability and reliability of service, based on SGML (<a
href="http://www.sil.org/sgml/sgml.html">
http://www.sil.org/sgml/sgml.html</a>) and Z39.50 (<a
href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency">
http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency</a>) as key standards. This is a major
subject of the close cooperation with the Consortium for Interchange of
Museum Information (CIMI <a
href="http://www.cni.org/pub/CIMI/www/framework.html">
http://www.cni.org/pub/CIMI/www/framework.html</a>), which has so far
concentrated its implementation efforts (the CHIO project) more on the
support of the non-professional user. There is also a cooperation with the
Getty Information Institute (<a href="http://www.gii.getty.edu/">http://www.gii.getty.edu/</a>) on thesaurus use and multilinguality. </p>

<p>Isolated components of the first prototype exist, and the overall
component integration  begins in March 1997. Very good progress has been
made, which allows us to present here a realistic view of the system to be,
but moreover to discuss aspects of its use.</p>

<p>The current paper concentrates on the folder management and indexing,
which comes right now into its first prototype stage. Besides the
description of the technical choices, we address consequences and open
questions of user procedures and organization, which emerged so far or are
expected to be outcome of the practical experiences with the system. </p>

<h2>2. The Notion of Folders</h2>

<p>A folder in the sense of AQUARELLE is a container gathering a structured
collection of specific information (text, image, etc.) and links to other
documents which relates to a certain theme or an activity. This is
typically the first step for most scientific work or planning of cultural
programs. </p>

<p>Obvious themes could be cultural objects or monuments, seen under the
aspect of construction, material and state, style and artistic expression,
function and social or political context. More complex themes could be
historical persons, artist schools or any other organization, places at
certain periods,  or any kind of performance as theater, music, crafts and
social events. As folders are seen close to the primary material (called
archives), wide-spreading themes as "Impressionism" or "Ming Dynasty" are
rather out of scope. The focus is clearly on setting archive material in a
context and on the visual aspects of items of the present and the past,
i.e. we talk about multimedia documents. Opposite to multimedia authoring,
aesthetic aspects of representation will only be regarded to the degree
they serve the comprehensiveness of the display. The folders are seen as an
auxiliary means for the research, documentation, didactic presentation etc,
and not as the presentation itself. </p>

<p>Folders may also be created or used to support characteristic activities
of the cultural professional. It may be a documentary service for general
use, but more typically the preparation of any kind of documentation and
publication, as exhibitions, traditional books, guides etc. or the planning
of conservation or restoration activities at a political or technical
level. Characteristic is the multitude of reasons, why data are referred
and for which purpose they may be regarded as useful (e.g. as in Principia
Cybernetica, <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Default.html">
http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Default.html</a>). They may support or contradict
an opinion, show various stages of a process, sides or phases of a
building, be unique or of high quality, prototypical or unusual. Such
hypermedia networks of semantically typed links will provide a real added
value to data collections, and relieve the user from the cumbersome manual
maintaining of cross references. We need for this purpose flexible
structures with an extensible  variety of link types, enriched by free-text
comments. </p>

<p>Besides that,  rigid data structures are needed for documentation of
cultural material for  statistical purposes. Statistical analysis needs
complete data on few data fields from many objects. Metadata about handling
of cultural material and the folders themselves such as authors, working
groups, tasks, subtasks, phases and versions require fixed structures as
well. We see, that neither a pure hypertext approach, nor a conventional
database schema is appropriate, but a combination of fixed schema for the
necessary information and extensible structures of explanatory character
for the optional information. </p>

<p>A question that arises is, who will create all these data structures and
at which cost. Fortunately, there are some prototypes or examples in the
field, beginning from the CIDOC Relational Data Model (<a
href="http://www.cidoc.icom.org/model/relational.model/">http://www.cidoc.icom.org/model/relational.model/</a>)
and other CIDOC documents, work of the CIMI Consortium, the MDA (<a
href="http://www.open.gov.uk/mdocassn"
>http://www.open.gov.uk/mdocassn</a>), until data forms internally in use
at various organizations. It can be expected, that there will be
similarities and common "cores" between the needed structures, allowing
experts or service providers to rapidly customize new ones from suitable
prototypes. Such procedures are explicitly foreseen by the TEI
(Text Encoding Initiative), as detailed below. Prototypes also help to
maintain semantic consistency between the products. Nevertheless, a more
formal agreement between the users on "core structures", fixed or
"official" schemata, as well as guidelines for variable structures, will be
helpful to support interoperability at retrieval and data interchange.
Obviously such structures will be more purpose-specific than even domain
specific. </p>

<p>"Core" data structures are not easily or never found, if the domain is
initially taken too wide, as e.g. with the CIDOC efforts to create a
minimal data model. The CIDOC Relational Data Model work shows clearly on
the other side, that a set of relevant  interrelated data and a convention
on their formal representation can be achieved for a multitude of more
separate purposes. </p>

<p>Primary and secondary data are in general not public, and quite often
represent a considerable capital of their owners. Besides data, that will
be published in the proper sense, we expect that an important part of
folders and primary data will be shared exclusively between smaller or
larger working groups and consortia. In particular, folders can refer to
folders allowing collaborating teams to create composite documents, where
each partner is owner of his part only. We must note that the target of
authors' interest may be not a whole folder, but a detail within it.
AQUARELLE currently discusses to allow for interdocument links directly to
document parts. </p>

<p>This mutual interlinkage provides the data layer for cooperative work.
Questions to be clarified in practice are the conditions under which folder
parts are regarded to be suitable to be referred by others, and which
changes should be possible, once a reference was made. There may be stages
of proposals for discussion, drafts, personal official opinions and
opinions of an organization. References may be to a document only as it was
at the time the reference was made. They may be tolerant to minor (e.g.
spelling) corrections or to changes of references therein. Or just the
opposite, they may refer to a document with the explicit wish that it
should always be updated to the latest state of knowledge. </p>

<p>Besides the widely discussed and open questions of intellectual rights,
economic models
of data sharing would be useful, which allow to make the mutual benefit of
those putting
much effort in providing data to those exploiting data more explicit. Many
good IT solutions may not find their way from research prototypes to real
use just because of
that, which is clearly a question out of the scope of  technology providers
and technology
funding. </p>

<p>In an interlinked network of documents, there is no clear semantic
boundary between the interior and exterior of a document. We adopted a
definition of the unit "folder" motivated by the creatorship - the unit
someone signs responsible for, an administrative view. Hence ownership and
access rights are at folder level, as well as spiritual rights. </p>

<p>The state-of-the-art standard to implement the appropriate data
structures for the above requirements is SGML. Rather than one Document
Type Definition (DTD), the system is designed to support an open number of
DTDs. In order to bootstrap the first evaluation phase, and for reasons of
interoperability from the very beginning, the project starts with the CIMIs
CHIO (Cultural Heritage Information On-Line) DTD and that of the French
Ministry of Culture CI ("Classer d'Inventaire"). We briefly comment the two
different approaches with respect to information structuring and handling.
</p>

<p>The CHIO DTD takes Text Encoding Initiative (TEI <a
href="http://etext.virginia.edu/TEI.html">
http://etext.virginia.edu/TEI.html</a>) as its starting point. One of the
most important aspect of TEI is that it provides a core of well-established
SGML techniques for representing hypermedia documents for humanities, in a
system-independent manner. People can then modify and extent the set of
basic element definitions (e.g., sections, subsections, lists, footnotes,
illustrations, bibliographies, etc.) so a specific version of the TEI DTD
can be designed for a specific domain such as Art descriptions (e.g.,
personal names, dates, places, etc.). In order to indicate the "museum"
interest to specific parts of documents, two mechanisms are identified in
the CHIO DTD: primary or secondary access points used for the description
of documents profiles to give a scope for (Z39.50) queries. </p>

<p>Primary access points indicating that a given part of the work is
"about" a particular concept (i.e., a <topic> element) or a particular
"museum point of view" (i.e., a <context> element). The corresponding tags
gain their expressive power from SGML attributes, indicating the type of
information they hold as well as their values. The <topic> element is a
general way to qualify a part of text as for instance "his is about that
person ... event, etc" The <context> element gives  more precise museum
context to elements as for instance "this is bout that  creator ...
historical context". </p>

 <p>Secondary access points dealing with mentioning of people, places, etc
which are of interest, but do not form the main topic of discourse. They
are represented by "ordinary" SGML elements either inherited directly by
the TEI DTD or invented specially for the CIMI DTD. </p>

<p>The French Ministry of Culture CI DTD is dedicated to territory
inventory making. It consists of folders that are classified in Content and
Filling folders. Content folders are used to describe single objects (i.e.,
artifacts like paintings), individuals (i.e. monuments like churches), sets
(i.e, cities like Cognac) and collections of objects (i.e.,
places-hotels-farms).  Filling folders are used to classify the content
folders and they are organized on a geographical area (e.g., a specific
commune) or a thematic topic. The approach used in the CI DTD is very
structural: filling folders can contain each other based on their
topological relationships and content folders are constructed recursively.
We must note that opposite to the CIMI DTD quite all elements are caring a
part of the cultural information described in the documents. </p>

<p>There is on-going work to compare these projects with the AQUARELLE
specifications. First, it remains open how to map the proposed structures
to the existing Cultural Databases i.e. the archive servers of the
AQUARELLE partners. Second, the mapping between information encoded
according to these DTDs, and Access Points in the AQUARELLE (Z39.50) query
profile will also be defined. Clearly, the two DTDs have a different
approach in marking cultural interest of information: a) using a pair of
specific tag to mark all Access Points (CIMI); b) using an SGML element for
each Access Point (CI). Finally, SGML folders' modularity and internal and
external links are subjects that needs further formalization and
experimentation. </p>

<h3>3. Folder Management Functionality</h3>

<p>Contract to the primary archive servers, folder servers are rare or do
not exist at all. They are however central to the objectives and
exploitation of AQUARELLE since they provide indirectly a sophisticated
user interface tool for discovering and digesting archive information. In
order to encourage users to switch from classic to digital authoring, the
folder environment will be provide flexible tools for creating and managing
folders as well as for searching information and browsing within the
network of inter-connected folder servers. More precisely the AQUARELLE
folder server supports the basic functions of: folders authoring and
publishing to the intended audience, "republishing" updates, withdrawing a
folder in an "unpublishing" action, classification, indexing and retrieval.
</p>

<p>We can imagine a typical scenario of folder creation as follows. </p>

<p>he user starts to retrieve via the reader user interface (not described
in more detail here) data, texts, images, folders, or other objects related
to her study or research. She may browse through folders and identify other
objects of interest within them. </p>

<p>She denotes the objects found in a list like the Netscape bookmarks. </p>

<p>She opens the AQUARELLE folder editor. It is a full SGML structured
editor, working as WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) relieving the
user from the obstacle to learn unintelligible codes spread out over the
text she writes. She may start with an empty screen, a special template
containing her usual header information, or a former folder as template.
The SGML structure guides the user to provide necessary and useful
information in a defined way. </p>

<p>The user inserts references of the data objects she has marked before in
the folder. Copies of these data objects will be hold locally as
appropriate during the editing process to reduce network traffic and the
dependency from an open connection.  When the folder is stored, references
and not the copies are saved for reasons of space economy, copyrights and
to allow for updates in the referred object. If permitted, the user may
request a copy to be inserted instead. </p>

<p>The folder can be saved at any time and brought back to the editor,
being accessible only by the author. Saving the folder implies its
registration on the server. </p>

<p>AQUARELLE will use SGML attributes to denote the wish, that the
respective tag has to contain words of a controlled vocabulary. For that
sake, a thesaurus browser is available to assist the user. Terms will be
"cut and paste" to the folder editor to avoid spelling errors. In case the
appropriate term cannot be found on the system, the user has the
possibility to define its own local term. It will be mandatory however to
link the new term with the next controlled broader term. This link allows
the query processors to access all information through controlled terms.
Thesaurus maintainers can use these links to embed local terms into the
authorities at an appropriate later stage. </p>

<p>The possibility to use controlled and local terms was an important
requirement of the AQUARELLE user community, expressed as well by other
working groups (MDA Workshop on Terminology, 11-14 Sept. '96,
http://www.open.gov.uk/mdocassn). Only the linkage to controlled terms  we
implement here provides the means to handle consistently controlled and
local terms. It furthermore facilitates a more efficient gathering of term
proposals for the authorities in use (see M. Doerr: "Authority Services in
Global Information Spaces", <a
href="http://www.ics.forth.gr/proj/isst/Publications/TechnicalReports.html"> http://www.ics.forth.gr/proj/isst/Publications/
TechnicalReports.html</a>). Current systems do not foresee such a
functionality. </p>

<p>The user will "cycle" between editing and retrieval until she achieves a
satisfactory form. In general, more than one editor is foreseen, however
only one instance can be downloaded for editing at a time, synchronizing
cooperative editing that way. </p>

<p>Finally, the keyword indexing facility is invoked and the folder is
submitted for publishing. The keyword indexing proposes to the user words
in the text as indices for retrieval. The user can accept, reject or alter
the proposed words. She may further classify the whole folder or parts of
it by more controlled indexing terms. For publishing, she defines the user
group, for which the folder will be accessible, and a narrower group, which
has editing permission - per default the author herself. The precise
permission scheme is still under discussion. </p>

<p>Once published, the system regards any changes to the folder as a new
version. A new version can be edited as above, and finally it will be
exchanged with the previous version. This "republishing" act may eventually
invalidate references, that other people have already made to this folder.
Necessarily in this case, a communication will be initiated by the system
which requests the other user to withdraw her reference. Only after the
situation is settled, the new version can be installed. This dependency
from external conditions is also the reason, why after the publishing a new
version must be introduced in any case. The same happens if the folder is
withdrawn as a whole in an "unpublishing" act. The precise communication
procedure on links going to be invalid will be subject to experimentation.
In any case, it will be a combination of human interaction and system
enforcement - in case the previous fails. </p>

<p>Besides the folder environment, a separate environment will be setup to
develop and maintain multilingual thesauri. It will be based on a
monolingual prototype developed by ICS-FORTH in cooperation with the Getty
Information Institute. It became absolutely clear in extensive discussions
with the AQUARELLE users, that
multiple thesauri will be in use,
that they need to be semantically interlinked in order to simultaneously
process queries sent to servers indexed in different languages or thesauri,
and
that user groups without thesauri in their native language will start with
translating foreign thesauri. </p>

<p>This system is capable to maintain simultaneously several thesauri,
links between them and term translations in various languages. Within
AQUARELLE it will be further developed to support specific AQUARELLE user
needs for editing, a simple versioning mechanism, and display and access to
all subthesauri and versions separately and in combination. Even though
these are novel features, the users need definitely more. The ideal
functionality will furthermore comprise distant communication between users
on the concepts and linkage to be done, utilities for term matching,
translations, quality control, reconfigurations and data exchange. This
exceeds the framework of AQUARELLE, and partners of the consortium wish to
use the experience in AQUARELLE for further focused projects on this issue.
</p>

<p>Another important aspect, that may be partially clarified in AQUARELLE,
are the organization and human procedures to achieve thousands of small
agreements on bunches of terms and links in a reasonable time in
international teams. It seems, that enabling techniques of electronic
communication and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) will play a
key role, as well as tools to assess logical consistency of the inner
structure of thesauri and proposed changes them. </p>

<h3>4. Technical Choices</h3>

<p>One of the basic choices is to follow standard technology at the data
and communication level, in order to facilitate open access by existing
systems and future service providers, to guarantee a long life-time of the
data created in the AQUARELLE environment, and to cater for use by low and
high-end systems and services. These standards are the WWW (e.g. HTML) for
access by low-cost systems, SGML for high-quality structuring of
information and Z39.50 for reliable access among heterogeneous data
sources. This motivates the architecture chosen as a modular system, with a
set of inner interfaces, that are standard and open to non-AQUARELLE data
and systems. </p>

<p><b>figure 1 :1 block diagram of the AQUARELLE architecture</b></p>


<p>A block diagram of the AQUARELLE architecture is shown in figure 1. Its
central module is the access server, which mediates between archive
databases, folder servers, thesaurus servers and user clients. It is
responsible for resource discovery, query handling, result management,
folder publication and one-to-one connection with servers. It also supports
handling of metadata of documents and guarantees the referential integrity
of  links between folders. </p>

<p>The user client module of the AQUARELLE user interface, consists of the
reader system and the authoring editor system.  The reader system allows
the AQUARELLE end user to access any published folder or folder part. It
supports folder retrieval through queries as well as browsing through the
folder hyperlinks. The reader system is implemented with a WWW client
solution. Either usual HTML clients can be used , or full SGML clients
(GRIF symposia, etc). Thus, the retrieved SGML folders are presented to the
user either in units of SGML subdocuments, if the client has the respective
capability, or as simple HTML pages by transcoding display behavior from
the original DTD format. </p>

<p>The authoring editor system is an environment suitable for creating and
modifying structured folders. The GRIF SGML editor (<a
href="http://www.grif.fr/"> http://www.grif.fr/</a>  was selected as tool
for folder editing according to the selected specific DTDs (CIMI, CI see
section 2). During folder editing, the user can add content descriptors
(semantic information) to folders under the discipline of the DTD. This is
supported by on-line queries on the thesaurus (Authority Service). </p>

<p>The main components of the folder server are the Local Folder
Catalogue,and the FTR (Full Text Retrieval System). A dedicated front-end
coordinates the cooperation of the Local Folder Catalogue and the Full Text
Retrieval System with the rest of the AQUARELLE architecture. More
precisely, it maintains communication with the Access Server, accepts the
queries, interprets them and routes them to Local Folder Catalogue and the
FTR. It manages storage and retrieval of folder instances. </p>

<p>The Local Folder Catalogue is based on the Semantic Index System
developed by ICS-FORTH (<a href="http://www.csi.forth.gr/proj/isst/"
>http://www.csi.forth.gr/proj/isst/</a>), a tool for describing and
documenting large evolving varieties of highly interrelated data, concepts
and complex relationships. It consists of a persistent storage mechanism
based on an object oriented semantic network model. The Local Folder
Catalogue also provides a navigation interface and a stateful Z39.50
compatible query protocol. </p>

<p>In the Local Folder Catalogue a local copy (of a part) of the thesaurus
subject hierarchy, the SGML DTDs and the folder instances are maintained.
The thesaurus servers in the access server as well as the Local Folder
Catalogue are based on the SIS and share identical structures but
eventually different data. The thesaurus servers are designed to support
query formulation and mediation. As such, they may provide for query
purposes other thesauri and links between them than those installed on a
local folder server. The Local Folder Catalogue can be accessed however as
thesaurus server by itself. The backbone of the Local Folder Catalogue is a
conceptual model (see figure 2) which describes the basic SGML constructs
(document logical elements), the basic notions of a thesaurus (Subject
Hierarchy) as well as the different categories of annotation links
associating SGML elements with thesaurus terms. </p>

<p>The left part of figure 2 illustrates the SGML metamodel, instances of
which can be any SGML DTD (such as CIMI or CI). The right part of the
figure illustrates the thesaurus model which has been developed following
the standards ISO 2788 (for monolingual thesauri) and the standard ISO 5964
(for multilingual thesauri). This model can support any thesaurus which
have been developed according to the above standards (such as AAT or
MERIMEE). The relations defined in this model are
``inter-thesaurus-relations'' and ``intra-thesaurus-relations''. The former
denote all the relations among terms existing in a specific thesaurus (i.e.
broader term relation BT) while the latter denote the relations between
terms residing in different thesauri (i.e. equals relation EQ). </p>



<p><b>figure 2 : Logical Structure of the Local Folder Catalogue</b></p>

<p>In the middle of figure 2 the link talks_about represents the
association of SGML elements with the thesaurus Subject Hierarchy notions.
Thus, it is possible to index (at fine granularity) any DTD element using
related thesaurus terms. For example, the folder_1 and folder_2 in figure 2
are respectively instances of the CI and CIMI DTD. As we can see, a
component of folder_1 is indexed by the ``Terme`ABBAYE'' existing in the
MERIMEE thesaurus.  Components of the folder_2 are indexed by
``Term`factory sites'' and ``Term`abbeys'' from the AAT thesaurus. The
representation of the inter thesaurus relations (i.e. EQ relation) allows
the association of terms (i.e. the english term ``Term`abbeys'' is equal to
the french one (``Terme`ABBAYE''). In this way, the Local Folder Catalogue
can offer automatic indexing facilities on folders (i.e. under the subject
hierarchy) by using the semantic information that the folder contains. The
folder creator can also index the folder using non-controlled terms which
must be associated to a broader controlled term of the thesaurus. </p>

<p>The FTR provided by INRIA (<a
href="http://www.loria.fr/CRIN/equipe/dialogue/">
http://www.loria.fr/CRIN/equipe/dialogue/</a> ), offers mechanisms for
automatic indexing of folders based on textual analysis. It provides
indexing and searching interfaces to the Authoring Environment and the
folder server front-end respectively. FTR indices can be keyword extraction
or relevance weighted. In addition, keywords can be associated to thesaurus
terms (i.e. controlled vocabulary) or not. The FTR system will use the same
contents identifications as the Local Folder Catalogue uses for analyzing
folders. It will not store any contents by itself, but will refer to the
Local Folder Catalogue contents in its results. The AQUARELLE user
community
made clear, that it sees a priority in extracting names and use of controlled or local terms
over typical FTR access by weighted occurrences of accidental words in a
text. Actually, the non-weighted indexing by names of persons, places,
objects and events was ranked very high.</p>

<p>A still open question is, to which degree the rich information structure
of the folders should be only exploited by Z39.50 queries and browsing. The
current AQUARELLE architecture focus on queries only to Z39.50 access
points. Then the retrieved folder identifiers are used for browsing to
locate specific parts of interest. It may be more useful to provide a query
interface to retrieve folders by combined conditions on content and
structure and this at any granularity of SGML tags according to the user
needs. To which degree such features could be "encoded" in "abstract"
Z39.50 access points needs further study. Finally to which degree DTDs and
Z39.50 profiles have to be harmonized for AQUARELLE purposes, and what may
be the consequences of working with multiple profiles has to be
investigated in the later phases of the project. </p>

<p><h3>5. Summary and Conclusions</h3></P>

<p>The AQUARELLE folders provide appropriate structures rich enough for the
demands of a support system for professional work in the cultural domain.
The elaboration of these structures and questions of how and to which
degree domain knowledge (as authorities or semantic SGML tags) can or has
to be embedded will be an interesting task from now on for users and system
providers. </p>

<p>The classification system and the resulting retrieval capabilities
deliver the technical means for the precision required by the expert. The
population of the thesauri to fully exploit this potential is however a
long term task for the cultural community, which will require considerable
organization. </p>

<p>The access services as directory service, metadata management,
referential integrity and access permission control are expected to provide
the mandatory reliability and transparency for the professional environment
so far not available on the Web. </p>

<p>AQUARELLE is going to provide kinds of services the user community
typically has no experience with. For that reason, many details for an
ideal implementation can only be worked out with hands-on experience on
prototypes. The project foresees therefore a redesign phase in the middle
of the project. </p>

<p>In order to become an efficient groupware however, the user community
must develop and clarify certain practices. Those will be modes of sharing
information under respect of intellectual rights, liability for contents,
and economic or other means to balance mutual benefit. They will in turn
give raise to modifications and enhancements of the system. </p>

<p>We hope, that the activities of AQUARELLE, CIMI and all others in the
field will give raise to a long and efficient cooperation of information
science and arts.</p>
