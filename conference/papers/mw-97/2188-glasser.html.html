<h2>MUSEUM APPLICATIONS OF THE WEB: EXPERIENCES</h2>

<h2>NEW IDEAS/NEW AUDIENCES</h2>
<p>Web technology brings with it new ideas and these new ideas, in turn,
can help museum's generate new audiences.  Currently, most museum Web pages
have been designed to address a finite audience pool, primarily museum
aficionados, tourists and travel agents, journalists, teachers, and
students.  As we move into the next generation of site development, what
other audiences can or should we attempt to reach?  And what changes in
content need to occur to attract these audiences?</p>
	<p>Statistics reveal that the average Web browser in the United States is
a 35 year old, married, college graduate with a professional occupation,
and a median income of $60,800 ($US).   In terms of education, marital
status, and income, this profile is a close match to that of our Museum
members.   The most notable difference falls within the age category; 61.6%
of our members are 55 and up-significantly older than the average Web user.
This suggests that the Web is a potential vehicle for attracting a new,
younger audience that shares other demographic characteristics with our
average museum member.  In other words, Web technology gives museums a
unique opportunity to reach an audience who might potentially enjoy a
museum experience if only we could coax them through our doors.  The intent
of this paper is to describe on a new kind of site content designed to
engage people who do not typically visit a museum, but might if they
understood us better, and conversely, if we became more familiar with
them.</p>
	<p>In an attempt to learn something about the interests and needs of this
audience, we developed a section of the new Virginia Museum of Fine Art's
Web site called, "You're the Expert."  When you enter this part of the Web
site you arrive at the first page which reads
Have you ever wanted to work in a museum?  What kinds of decisions would
you need to make as a curator, an exhibition designer, a conservator, or
other museum expert?  "You're the Expert" presents you with real-case
scenarios and lets you play the role of the expert.  Then compare your
solution to those of our staff:.  Who knows, you might even learn a little
about art along the way.</p>

<p>	The first installment dealt with a curatorial issue concerning the
authenticity of an object in our Ancient Art collection.  We own one of two
extant life-size statues of the Roman emperor Caligula and there has been a
great deal of speculation as to whether the head on this statue was carved
from the same block of marble as the body.  The museum has undertaken a
variety of studies to determine the answer to this controversy and we used
our findings to introduce visitors to this type of curatorial research.</p>
	<p>After receiving the "problem" in the form of a memo from the Director,
the visitor is given several options for proceeding: learning about the
object (which links the visitor to the collections section of the site);
reading about historical precedents that explain why it is not uncommon for
full-length Roman sculptures to have a break at the neck; discovering the
results of a visual examination, and also a laboratory analysis of the
work.  After the visitor decides they have collected enough data, they are
given the option of making their own decision as to whether or not the head
and body were carved from the same block of marble.  They are also invited
to read the curator's decision based on the same information, and to record
their opinions and comments.  The topic was selected to appeal to visitors
with interests beyond art including history and science.  The exercise
reflects, in a microcosm, the catholic knowledge encompassed by museum
work.<p>
	<p>The second installment deals with a marketing issue.  We have a
(moderately) esoteric exhibition coming to the museum this summer on
Chinese objects of personal adornment from the Shang Period to the Ming
Dynasty.  The museum has been struggling to develop a marketing strategy
for this exhibition, wondering how to make this material interesting and
relevant to our community.  We decided to go to our Web visitors and ask
them what advertising approach would pique their curiosity enough to visit
the exhibition.  We provide several of our own ideas and ask them to select
the one they find most appealing.  We also invite them to suggest their own
marketing strategies.  Once the museum has developed its own plans, the
results will be included on the site.  This installment in particular, has
been developed in the hopes of capturing suggestions for attracting a
broader general audience than would be typical for this type of
exhibition.</p>
	<p>We are a new site and these are the first two scenarios we have put up
to date.  Several others are in the planning stages: we're one of the few
art museums in the country with a multi-person lighting department with a
full-time lighting specialist.  The knowledge that the lighting department
staff brings to exhibition development is impressive.  To highlight this
component of exhibition development, our lighting specialist will
illuminate a particular object three radically different ways based on a
curator's specifications; then visitors will get to select which lighting
option they think is most effective and hear what our specialist has to say
about each option.  As many of us are aware, label writing is a
controversial issue in many museums: what type of information to include,
what information to exclude, how long it should be, how much 'art speak' to
include, etc.  We will be posting a very detailed Indian miniature painting
that depicts a multi-episode story; the story, as well as biographical
information about the artist, information on the cultural context, and data
on the materials used by the artist will be included; visitors will then be
asked to pick the information they would find most interesting for
inclusion in an object label.  Another scenario has to do with the
reframing of our American painting collection.  The curator has been
working in recent years to reframe the collection using authentic period
frames.  Working with a single painting from the collection, the visitors
will get to 'try on' several frames to see how radically a frame can effect
our perception of a painting.  After picking the frame of their choice, the
curator's comments for each can then be reviewed.  These are just a few of
the scenarios that we will be putting up over the next year.</p>
	<p>Visitors to the site love this "game."  Virtually every note to the
Webmaster has sighted this part of our Web page as their favorite section.
But our reasons for developing "You're the Expert" go far beyond that of
creating an entertaining diversion for our electronic visitors.  In
choosing to develop this concept, the Museum had three important objectives
in mind-exploiting the technology, furthering our educational mission, and
increasing the impact of our marketing plans.</p>
<h2>EXPLOITING THE TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>Contrary to much of the popular advice currently circulating, it is
perfectly logical to start by putting your museum's brochure-type
information on a Web site.  However, it is a gross under-utilization of the
technology if that is the only information the site provides.
Interactivity is the single greatest contribution that Web technology has
to offer the museum field-and the least exploited.  I can think of no other
forum available to museums that allows us two-way communication with such a
large, eclectic audience at such a nominal expense.  This two-way
communication has numerous applications for museums two of which-education
and marketing-I will be discussing shortly.</p>
	<p>The second unique contribution that Web technology brings to museums is
ease of production and modification.  I doubt that the Virginia Museum of
Fine Arts is different than others in its bureaucratic structure.  This
structure brings with it long-established work habits, including elaborate
production schedules for museum publications.  Production timelines at our
museum include:</p>
<ul><li>press kit packages	4 months</li>
<li>invitations		4 months</li>
<li>gallery guides		6 months</li>
<li>small catalogues		6 months</li>
<li>medium catalogues	9 months</li>
<li>large catalogues		12 months</li>
<li>scholarly books		3-6 years</li></ul>

	<p>These timelines are essential for accommodating writing, editing,
design, production bids, printing, labeling, and distribution.  If we were
to print in a traditional medium, an educational brochure, pre-visit guide,
or teacher resource similar to the information currently appearing in
"You're the Expert" segments, each one would take us  4-6 months to
produce.  Using the Web site on the other hand, we can omit the most time
consuming (and expensive) components of this process: bids, printing,
labeling, and distribution.  Information can be written, edited, and
uploaded within weeks.  And corrections, if needed, can be done almost
instantaneously.  This flexibility is particularly helpful with educational
materials since it allows us to respond quickly to visitor feedback and
amend the information making it as educationally effective as possible.
The speed of production and adaptability of Web site content is
unparalleled by any traditional platform used by museums.</p>
	<p>From a technological standpoint then, "You're the Expert" was developed
to include something on our site that would more effectively exploit the
interactive nature of the technology as well as its ease of production and
modification.</p>
<h2>FURTHERING OUR EDUCATIONAL MISSION</h2>
<p>Just because this is a new technology does not mean that we should
dismiss what we already do well; rather, we can build on our knowledge when
developing our sites.  The educational philosophy at the Virginia Museum
focuses on a participatory approach to learning that is beautifully
complemented by the interactive possibilities of the Internet.  I'm sure
many of you have heard the educational maxim, "people retain 10% of what
they read, 20% of what they hear, 30% of what they see, and 90% of what
they do."  At the Virginia Museum, we attempt to make our educational
programs as experiential as possible.  We believe the most effective
educational experience allows visitors to apply the information they
receive during their visit to interests and experiences they already
possess; it is through this self-selecting process that people expand their
knowledge in a personally meaning way.  "You're the Expert" allows visitors
to pursue the types of information they are interested in in an order they
determine for themselves (self-selection) and then provides them with an
opportunity to apply that information immediately to a specific, concrete
problem (experiential learning).  While a visitor might find it moderately
interesting to read that Caligula was a despised Roman emperor, they are
much more likely to appreciate the importance of this knowledge when they
see how it is used by a museum curator to learn more about the art on view
in the galleries.</p>
<p>	In addition to designing educational elements of the Web site to
complement our existing pedagogical philosophy, we also tried to build on
another of our successful experiences.  We have learned over the years that
one of the first things new members, interns, volunteers, and museum
studies students are interested in doing is discovering what the museum is
like behind-the-scenes.  "You're the Expert" lets visitors 'sneak a peek'
behind the scenes while it exposes them to the myriad skills and expertise
that go into operating a museum.</p>
	<p>As an instructive tool, "You're the Expert" complements our existing
educational philosophy and builds on our past pedagogical experiences.  The
final factor that helped to shape the "You're the Expert" section has to do
with marketing issues.</p>
<h2>INCREASING MARKETING IMPACT</h2>
<p>The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts recently completed a three-year project
funded by the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Museum Collections Accessibility
Initiative.  As part of this grant, we conducted community focus groups to
learn ways to expand our audience into new segments of the community.  From
this enlightening experience, we discovered how effective it was to ask
people what they wanted rather than to sit in our conference rooms and
guess-a common-sensical but elusive concept for art museums.  For example,
while trying to select a signature image for the accompanying exhibition,
we selected a group of non-museum visitors from the surrounding community,
and showed them several potential images.  During the course of the
discussion, we found that the group responded much more favorably to an
image of a real person than to any of the inanimate objects we were
proposing.  For our signature image we ended up hiring a model which proved
to be immensely successful in attracting new audiences.</p>
<p>	One of the best ways to get non-museum visitors to visit the museum is
to talk to them, and identify their likes and dislikes, what gets their
attention, and piques their curiosity.  Unfortunately, we don't have money
to do the kind of intensive focus groups needed to solicit this type of
information on a regular basis.  But with the Web site we can do an
abbreviated version.  This is another idea behind "You're the Expert,"
particularly, the segment we recently put up on the marketing strategies
for our upcoming Chinese ornament exhibition.</p>
<p>	As mentioned earlier, the exhibition can be perceived as rather
esoteric.  It is a show about very small, very old objects from a culture
that most people know very little about.  Our challenge is to position the
exhibition in such a way that these objects have some relevance to people
living today.  To be successful, our marketing strategy will have to make
the public curious enough about the exhibition to want to visit the museum.
"You're the Expert" offers us an opportunity to pilot some of our
marketing ideas to see which ones garner the strongest, most favorable
responses.  Visitors may even present ideas that we had not thought of
(we're still exploring how we would handle this; if someone were to suggest
a marketing strategy that we actually wanted to use, we would want to
extend an acknowledgment to them: thank them on the Web site, send them
free tickets to the exhibition or perhaps a catalogue to the show; this
detail hasn't been decided yet).</p>
<p>	In a similar vein, visitor evaluations are a burgeoning area within the
museum field and all kinds of research is currently being conducted on
visitor perceptions about visiting museums.  While it is relatively easy to
capture data from regular museum visitors using on-site surveys, this
information is necessarily biased toward people with a propensity for
visiting museums-after all, they are already there.  How do we find out why
we are failing to attract others?  With Web technology, this whole category
of people is literally inviting us into their homes.  We need to take
advantage of this invitation and use it to discover ways to better meet
their needs and interests.  As we discovered with our Lila Wallace-Reader's
Digest project, sometimes the best approach is just asking.  If you can ask
in a way that is both engaging and (incidentally) educational, all the
better.</p>
	<p>We are currently pursuing this idea one step further by using the site
as part <u>of</u> a marketing plan.  We have an exhibition coming up in
September from the Warner Collection of the Gulf States Paper Corporation
of American art which the curator is calling, American Dreams.  In an
attempt to build wide community interest in the exhibition, we are
entertaining using the Web site to solicit comments from visitors about
their vision of the American dream.  We will compile their comments on the
site along with information about the exhibition and accompanying programs.
We may also use some of the more eloquent comments in advertising and
radio spots.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
	<p>There are numerous advantages to incorporating an interactive component
to your Web site.  However, there are some cautions that should be
considered as well.  First, it is  more technologically involved because it
requires using CGI programming in addition to simple HTML coding.  If, like
the Virginia Museum, there is no dedicated staff working on your Web site
and you are relying on existing staff who are self-taught in this
technology, it can be a little taunting and/or expensive.  Second, it is
more labor intensive.  Giving a monologue is always less taxing than
engaging in a conversation, and introducing interactivity to your site
transforms it from an electronic brochure to a two-way communication
system.  Updating and responding to those external voices can take
significant staff time.
	Nonetheless, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts thinks it is worth the time
and energy.  Visitors' responses have been overwhelming; virtually everyone
who contacts the Webmaster comments specifically on how engaging the
section is.  While we are thankful that "You're the Expert" addresses the
needs and interests of our visitors, it has been developed to meet the
needs and interests of the museum as well.  It provides an on-going focus
group that helps us 'eavesdrop' on what audiences (both current and future)
respond to most strongly.</p>
	<p>With a little imagination, museums can use their Web sites to learn how
to improve their marketing strategies, and gain valuable insights into
audience responses to programs and educational resources.  It is an
information delivery system for browsers but it can also be a learning tool
for museums.  If we're smart, new technology = new ideas = new
audiences.</p>
