<h2>Developing A National Strategy for Multimedia Cultural Heritage</h2>

<p>In a society where information and communications technologies are
increasingly reshaping the approach to knowledge acquisition and
dissemination, a major opportunity is created in the area of cultural and
architectural heritage. This shift towards an information based society has
a strong impact over the cultural public  sector, particularly since
museums and organizations in charge of architectural as well as
archaeological heritage are at their most fundamental level information
institutions.</p>
<p>The new emphasis given to information acquisition and dissemination for
cultural organizations is clearly reflected in some public statements,
among which that of the Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe
(CSCE) in the June 1991 document that was adopted by 34 governments. In
this document the following statement was made on culture and heritage :
</p>
<ul><li>The complete and lasting documentation of sites, structures,
cultural landscapes, objects and cultural systems, including historical,
religious and cultural monuments, as they presently exist is one of the
most important legacies to the cultural heritage that can be provided for
future generations.
<li>The participating States recognize the usefulness and importance of
exchanging information on preserving the cultural heritage and acknowledge
that the use of data banks, on a national and multilateral level, could
make a useful contribution to this work".
<li>Implicitly this statement demonstrates that cultural institutions' role
is not only to collect, preserve and display the material collections,
sites and/or objects, it is also to generate, perpetuate and organize the
dissemination of knowledge towards target users and audiences.
<li>An even greater emphasis was given to this subject at the meeting of
the G7 in Brussels in 1995, where it was specified that "culture is a key
dimension of the Information Society. The exchange of information on the
world's cultural heritage will help people from different cultures around
the world to understand each other better" . Supporting this statement,
among the eleven projects launched by the G7, one is dedicated to
"Multimedia access to World Cultural Heritage". The purpose of this project
is "to acce-lerate the multimedia digitization of collections, and to
ensure their accessibility to the public and as a learning resource for
schools and universities". The preparation of this G7 project was entrusted
to the Italian and French governments.</li></ul>
<p>European countries own the largest part of the Western-world cultural
heritage, and this heritage, have been extensively described and catalogued
by professional curators and researchers.</p>
<p>In most European countries an important effort has been done, often
during centuries, to preserve, describe and index the cultural heritage.
More recently, many public authorities or private entities have undertaken
to digitalise a more or less important part of this heritage.
Digitalization means creating databases containing images, reference
documents, factual data, sounds, describing as precisely as possible the
items constituting the cultural heritage. Paintings, sculptures, monuments,
ancient manuscripts, music instruments, historical furniture, art
photographs, etc. can be described by digital information, thus offering
potentially to a large population of users an easy access to our cultural
heritage.</p>
<p>This digitalization effort will have to be carried-on for several years to reach some completeness. Very large information bases containing millions of images and documents are going to be constituted.</p>
<p>Since the 80's, computer systems become a privileged way for cultural
organizations to extend their reach, and develop a new type of
relationships with third parties, be it professional users and specialists
(like art galleries, teachers or researchers), or a wider audience.</p>
<p>Some cultural organizations have set a priority on making the
information available to external users, using the resources that were
available. Interactive multimedia technologies stand as a catalyst,
accelerating the implementation of these changes through organizations.
They significantly enrich existing information systems, particularly since
they provide access to images, video and sound, therefore compensating for
one of the limitation of textual databases which could never allow for a
comprehensive description of work of arts. Simultaneously, associated with
hypertexts and hypermedia they provide for a much easier, and friendly-user
interface than previous technologies.</p>
<p>In France, three years ago, we decided to study the new role of computer
systems in this area. Based on this study, we could define a strategy to
produce distributed multimedia information systems, to offer access to
inter-related reference multimedia documents, standardized notices, still
and moving images, describing the cultural heritage: paintings, sculptures,
monuments, musical instruments, historical furniture, etc.</p>
<p>Before to describe this strategy, it's necessary to explain the current
practice of information systems in French cultural organization and added
value of multimedia technologies.</p>
<p>Management of cultural heritage involves the accomplishment of the
following of missions, which to a greater or a lesser extent are allocated
to public sector organizations by law or policies defined by local
authorities :</p>
<ul><li>identification and location of physical resources (object,
building, sites)
<li>detailed inventory describing these resources
<li>preservation, and conservation to maintain resources
<li>management of these resources (storage, exhibitions)
<li>dissemination of information to target user and audiences</li></ul>
<p>These missions tend to be implemented by different categories of
professionals within cultural organizations, for instance museum
registrars, conservators, curators and scientists differ among themselves
in what they view to be the key attributes of an object. The registrar will
focus on inventory control which involves fields of information such as
storage location, the object number and name, it's condition and valuation.
The scientist, will be more concerned with in depth information on a
smaller part of the collection, focusing on precision's regarding the
object exact condition (for instance how it is made, and the associated
technics of fabrication).</p>
<p>Therefore the practice has often led to the development of
individualized information systems, satisfying the needs of these various
users. Simultaneously reflecting the diversity of content managed by
different cultural organizations, individualized information systems have
been created, allowing for the management of distinct types of
collections.</p>
<p>But for the most part of professionals involved in the French
experiments the resulting improvements for the management of these
resources are significant : </p>
<ul><li>it increases the effectiveness of the workgroup : "the computerized
inventory is a working tool that not only improves the knowledge of
patrimony (38 000 monuments, and 200 000 objects), it also contributes to
the enhanced management of these resources and constitutes an excellent
vehicle for dissemination of the information towards researchers and the
public", Jean Paul Saint Aubin, Direction du Patrimoine .
<li>it improves the handiness and accessibility of the information, for
instance the collection of 130 000 drawings held by the Département des
Arts Graphiques du Louvre, "could only be located with the use of two
criteria (inventory number, and name of artist previously to the use of
information systems" , states Michèle Gardon (responsible for the
database), following the development of a database researches can be
conducted using seven different criteria .
<li>it allows for a better management of resources, particularly with the
automation of movements (acquisitions, exhibits, losses, etc.), as
underlines Philippe Avenier, from the Bureau de l'Informatique et de la
Recherche of the Direction des Musées de France "it provides national
museums with a tool for the management of collections, (...) and allows
them to handle precisely works of arts transportation and physical
movements" .</li></ul>
<p>In summary, "computers can help manage the information, but the
structure of the information that is important about collections must be
determined separately for each institution" .</p>

<h3>The added value of interactive multimedia technologies to cultural
organizations.</h3>
<p>The major result of the study is that multimedia technologies
substantially modifies the underlying problematic of cultural organization
computerization : </p>
<ul><li>By enabling computers to integrate text, sound and imaging forms
they increase information systems' effectiveness as a working tool.
Traditional tasks such as conservation, preservation and research can be
performed in a much more comprehensive environment than they used to be,
<li>Secondly they also enhance cultural organizations ability to
disseminate information to users and audiences. Digitized sets of
information become a new and forceful way of conveying contents externally,
<li>Lastly, both of these elements compel cultural organizations to
position their information systems in a different way, it urges them to
move beyond "the outmoded model that associates computers with hard
science", and "start planning their computer usage as one of the array of
vital communication tool" .
<li>These shifts bear important implications on the overall positioning of
these institutions, for instance the greater emphasis put on knowledge
dissemination, and the establishment of common rules for exchange of
information. </li></ul>
<p>Interactive multimedia technologies enhance computer systems'
performances both as a working and as a research tool for the different
categories of users within cultural organizations.</p>
<h3>Interactive multimedia technologies as a working tool</h3>
<p>To begin with multimedia adds a new dimension to the execution of some
tasks conducted within cultural organizations. A rapid overview of the
resulting benefits applied to some of the missions of those institutions
illustrates this point : </p>
<ul><li>identification and location of physical resources can be connected
to geographical information systems (including maps and pictures). This
allows for a more accurate and comprehensive approach where the local
environment characteristics' are incorporated in the presentation of filed
objects (such as monuments, building or sites),
<li>inventory of resources can incorporate images, sound, or videos related
to the artifact. Images significantly enrich the existing descriptions,
they add to the completeness of the textual information contained in the
database. Their use is particularly helpful since it allows to visualize in
real time objects that are inaccessible because of their fragility,
precariousness, or remoteness (in the case of buildings or sites). Access
to images also facilitates the task of developing consistent catalogs
(either on paper, or in electronic form),
<li> preservation, and conservation of resources is one of the area where
the added value of these new technologies is extremely important. The use
of high resolution images (photographs, and X-rays) sometimes shared with
research departments allows to conduct more accurately tasks such as
condition checking and reporting, or detailed analytical documentation
production,
<li>management of these resources (storage, and exhibitions), in this
context images are a valuable tool to support the management of inventory,
movements, insurance, indemnity and valuation. They allow for instance to
check more thoroughly that no damage has occurred over time, or on the
occasion of a loan for an exhibition.</li></ul>
<h3>Interactive multimedia technologies as a research tool</h3>
<p>Art scientists and researchers have stimulated the development of
projects focusing on the development of systems using high resolution
images, and virtual reality. They have successfully initiated the
development of various European projects in the area of high resolution
images. To this day the most important projects are : </p>
<ul><li>VASARI (Visual art systems archiving retrieval images) initial
focus was to address issues such as color deterioration of paintings, and
transportation damages of objects lent to exhibitions. VASARI main
technical achievement was the preliminary designing of a very high
resolution scanning and analysis system.
<li>NARCISSE  (network of art research computer image systems in Europe),
is a project which has succeeded in creating a high resolution image data
bank for the conservation of data such as X-ray, infrared reflectograms and
photographs. The equipment used achieves digital entry of 6000 dots on 8000
radiography lines (which provides for digitized reproduction of paintings
that can reach 2.3 gigabytes). The associated database includes three main
files, related to the "work" (including fields such as artist, title, date,
location etc.), the "film" (type size, development conditions), and the
"state of the work" (made of four sub groups : original elements,
alteration, and interventions). A glossary in eight languages based on the
thesaurus has been produced, and distributed under the form of a CD-ROM
(Arts and Science) . Additionally Dataware has developed some interesting
functions, based on the Influx software used in a UNIX environment, it uses
a multilingual thesaurus, and executes multilingual inquiries.
<li>MARC (methodology for art reproduction in color) builds on some of the
results of VASARI, with the objective of developing colorimetric printing
techniques, using high resolution images for art catalogues edition.
<li>MUSA (Use of multimedia technologies for protecting the cultural
heritage in Italy and Germany), also builds on results from VASARI and aims
at developing techniques and methodology for electronic publishing.
<li>Virtual reality presents a strong potential to researchers for whom it
is a very powerful way of exploring hypothesis regarding archaeological
sites, and remains of monuments. For the director of the Gamsau (Groupe
d'étude pour l'application des méthodes scientifiques à l'architecture et
l'urbanisme) , Paul Quintraud, "the improvement of conservation and
knowledge of our cultural heritage naturally implied for our researchers to
leverage virtual reality as a tool to visualize former sites and monuments.
(...) This creation of images is closely linked with the most recent
discoveries on site, and archaeological research conducted on these topics"
.
</li></ul>	
<p>In France these researches have led to positive achievements, such as
the reconstitution of monuments such as Cluny church, Strasbourg cathedral,
or sites such as Paris in the 18th century, or the old city of
Marseille.</p>
<h3>The strengthening and diversification of knowledge dissemination</h3>
<p>Over the past years public sector cultural organizations have put a
greater emphasis on their mission of knowledge dissemination to external
users, including professional users, specialists and domestic users. As
main owners of contents in the area of art, and archaeological cultural
heritage they play a central role in spreading information related to
culture throughout Europe. As a consequence, more importance has been given
to satisfying the needs of different publics.</p>
<p>Progressively this is leading to the development of a segmentation of
their market, this involves "distinguishing different subgroups, so that
each group is characterized by an homogenous set of needs" , this approach
results in thedevelopment of different types of services positioned so as
to address the needs of target users. In this context interactive
multimedia technologies enable cultural organizations to implement those
strategies of dissemination with a tool which diversifies the way
information can be structured and communicated to external audiences. </p>
<h3>Shaping effective content for target users</h3>
<p>Multimedia technologies provide for a new approach of content
management. It breaks the linearity of traditional ways of creating,
composing and disseminating information. It creates new opportunities for
presenting an object, using the support of different media (text, images,
sound and video), and offers the possibility to interact and navigate in
the displayed information. Thereby the status of the audience changes,
rather than "reader", or "spectator", from now on the audience is composed
of individual users with specific characteristics.</p>
<p>Yet what truly makes multimedia applications ideally suited to knowledge
applications is the implementation of the hypertext, and hypermedia model.
Their implementations allows users to browse, and/or skip from a set of
relevant information to the other. They are empowered to apply an
autonomous approach to knowledge building, navigating through vast
quantities of information that can be cross- referenced to one another.</p>

<p>As a result, it appears that the development of an interactive
multimedia on line application in the area of cultural heritage benefits
more (at least in a first phase) from linking and integrating information
resources across different organizations, than of diversifying the types of
media used to support the development of multimedia modules.</p>
<p>So far three ways of structuring multimedia information have been
developed, they are used either separately, or in combination in existing
off line and on line multimedia applications : </p>
<ul><li>Those that present reference type of information available for
arbitrary and random access. These services are characterized by the fact
that they incorporate a fairly comprehensive collection of information
pertaining to one specific subject, they often leverage the way resources
are already gathered and organized in pre-existing databases. The challenge
for these types of services is to define a set of research criteria that
address adequately target users needs. Professional services will tend to
use retrieval methods identical and/or very similar to the ones implemented
on electronic databases, they often assume a significant level of computer
literacy from users. To the contrary, those aiming at wider audiences
(educational, or domestic), will design new user interfaces characterized
by their user friendliness. This often involves selecting carefully a
limited number of research criteria to facilitate users' navigation through
the displayed information.
<li>Those that implement a hierarchical approach, which provide users with
a structured approach of the content. This implies that the information are
organized in an orderly, and sequential manner, to reinforce the user's
understanding of the subject dealt with. This type of approach serves
informational, and more particularly educational purposes. It's accuracy
depends on the effectiveness with which logical dependencies are defined
between various modules of information. Until now, it has been widely used
in off line products, and more recently for services developed on the world
wide web.
<li>The last type of approach that has been developed so far, is that which
exploits the potential of simulation and virtual reality. They provide the
user with the possibility of exploring virtual environments. So far, it has
been mostly used in a very specific field, which is that of video games,
where events are determined interactively by users based on his selection
of parameters.</li></ul>
<h3>Diversified access to information resources</h3>
<p>Digitized information can be communicated over networks, and therefore
can be used in a greater variety of environments. They contribute to
integrate cultural organizations into a wider community. This evolution
combined with the power of multimedia data compels these organizations to
move towards the interconnection of their resources, to collaborate and
expand their reach.</p>
<p>This is clearly reflected by some public statements such as that of
ICOM, which recommends that : " Museums in all countries be encouraged to
develop and implement effective methods of bringing together and
disseminating all manner of museum information". Additionally it emphasizes
that "there should be closer collaboration between museum curators,
conservators-restorers and educators in the production of publications on
collections, exhibitions and objects so as to provide precise information
about them" </p>
<p>The need for the development of interconnected and open networks
	To fully grasp the existing opportunity cultural organizations need to
operate in a more integrated manner, and therefore overcome some of the
limitations resulting from the establishment of heterogeneous information
systems. This involves being able to exchange information in a seamless way
through an interconnected and open network. It also involves developing
standards allowing to share effectively existing resources.</p>
<p>Developing a network over which information can circulate transparently
is the first prerequisite towards the building of an integrated cultural
community. In the absence of any other widely spread solution, over the
past years Internet has become the open network increasingly used by
cultural organizations. Particularly since it fulfills many of the
functions that are expected for : E-Mail, file transfer, log-on remote
computers, and a diversified range of research tools (the most commonly
used being WAIS , gopher , and the World Wide Web ).</p>	
<p>Recent years have witnessed the developments of many applications :</p>
<ul><li>Forums on the subjects of the business of running museums,
exhibition techniques, efficacy of scientific methods have flourished,
<li>Hundreds of cultural organizations have created multimedia applications
using the World Wide Web : ranging from museums presentations, and virtual
exhibitions, to presentations of an artist, or extracts from off line
products,
<li>Internet is now viewed by many as the solution that allows individual
cultural entities to "coalesce into a group with the power of a collective
voice", it is even perceived as "challenging museums to build new models
for collaboration, scholarship, and exhibition" .</li></ul>
<p>It is thought that in the near term future current limitations of
Internet in the area of secured transaction processing will be solved.
Simultaneously it should be possible to implement identified copyright
solutions on the network, once they are selected.</p>
<h3>Towards the developments of standards in cultural organizations</h3>
<p>The potential of on-line multimedia applications has given a new
importance to the exchange of information within and between cultural
organizations. It has therefore stimulated the ongoing work on the
definition of standards that enable interchange of information between
organizations.</p>
<h3>Keys of the strategy</h3>
<p>Four keys for a national strategy for multimedia cultural heritage
result from this study :<p/>
<h3>A distributed system</h3>
<p>The digital information describing the cultural heritage is created by a
large number of private and public entities : museums, photography
agencies, specialized public services in charge of national or regional
heritage, public libraries, etc. For a given request, a user is likely to
need to access to information elements owned by several of these entities
and located on different information servers.<p>
<p>The project aims at defining common standards for representing, indexing
and communicating cultural information. All the entities who will accept to
store and disseminate information along these standards will participate in
an international cultural heritage network. A user having access to modern
telecommunication facilities(e.g.: ISDN) will be able to search
information in the whole network, respectively of the physical location of
the information matching his request.</p>
<h3>Advanced browsing and retrieval functionalities</h3>
<p>Classical database system have demonstrated strong limitations in the
possibilities offered to the user to retrieve information. Quite often the
user encounters difficulties in expressing the complex semantics of his
request as a query composed of a Boolean combination of values or ranges of
values. Recent multimedia information systems offer richer and more
flexible interaction paradigms: the user may of course express Boolean
queries as usual, but he can also create templates for regular requests,
define constraints on the value of composite variables computed during the
querying process, express questions in free text, follow links representing
hierarchies, cross-references, or various semantical relations between
documents, and browse a set of selected documents to explore freely their
content.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as mentioned before, the target system will be an
international network of information servers, accessible world-wide. A user
should therefore be offered the possibility to express his requests in his
national language. Last but not least, the distribution of information
among servers should be hidden to the end-user, for transparent access.</p>
<h3>A safe, fair and reliable system</h3>
<p>The private or public entities owning the items constituting the
cultural heritage, and those building and feeding the digital information
banks representing it, need to keep some control on the usage of this
information. Some information may have restricted access rights, some may
be accessed only under specific copyrights limiting further reproduction or
dissemination. Most users, if not all of them, will probably have to pay
some fees to contribute to the cost of the information system itself, and
may eventually have to pay some part of the information which is not in the
public domain.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, the target system needs to offer reliable
protection of the intellectual property rights, effective protection
against unauthorized access, and flexible mechanisms for billing and
charging users.</p>
<p>Strong attention will be given to the issue of reusability of the
information, to guarantee that the digital information will have a much
longer life than the technologies used to store and disseminate it. </p>
<h3>Professional oriented</h3>
<p>The primary users of the target system are professionals : museums
curators, public administration in charge of protecting the cultural
heritage, commercial companies in multimedia business, art galleries
managers, etc.</p>
<p>The target system will facilitate the realization of information
products (i.e. CDs or virtual exhibitions) for a large public, who will
benefit indirectly from the professional system.<p>
<p>The study analyses users needs and motivations, assesses the economic,
technical and organizational constraints, identify the elementary projects
that should be undertaken to implement it successfully, and assess
motivation and willingness of the main potential actors to contribute to
it.<p>
<p>Basically, users belong to three broad professional categories :</p>
<h3>Regular users</h3>
<ul><li>scientists: curators, archivists, researchers, etc. They select and
identify objects, constitute catalogues, evaluate, and perform historical
and scientific research on artworks and heritage items.
<li>managers who take care of the collections , organize their move (loans)
and exhibitions, buy new items , etc.
<li>mediators who organize meetings, events, conferences, visits, for a
diverse audience (scholars, adults, tourists, etc.). </li></ul>
<h3>Occasional users</h3>
<ul><li>art traders,
<li>experts (economy, geography, history, etc.),
<li>mayors, and policy-makers at regional or national levels,
<li>urban planers,
<li>professionals of tourism and cultural events organizers,
<li>professionals of communication and advertisement,
<li>journalists... </li></ul>
<h3>"Producers" </h3>
<ul><li>publishers ( art-books, tourism guides, education),
<li>multimedia publishers ( CDI, CD-ROM, Photo-CD),
<li>photo agencies,
<li>various cultural entities occasionally or regularly acting as
publishers : galleries, <li>museums, public or private foundations or
agencies, etc.</li></ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>It is therefore important to design information systems that will make
possible effective management of these huge information banks, easy
retrieval of the relevant information, that will address the needs of the
professional users and that will facilitate the realization of interactive
presentations for the general public.<p>
<p>The challenge is to define services that address adequately target users
needs. Professional services will tend to use retrieval tools identical
and/or very similar to the ones implemented on electronic databases, they
often assume a significant level of computer literacy from users. To the
contrary, those aiming at wider audiences (educational, or domestic), will
design new user interfaces characterized by their user friendliness. This
often involves selecting carefully a limited number of research criteria to
facilitate users' navigation through the displayed information.</p>
<p>Today in France, we have two different roads: one for professional
use, one for general public.Targets are not the same. Forgetting this reality
would be a great mistake.</p>
