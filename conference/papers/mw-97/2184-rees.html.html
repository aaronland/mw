<h2>Income Producing Activity and the Web</h2>
<h4>10-2-97</h4>

<p>Charging for access to information on WWW is still something of a rarity
and considered by many as being contrary to the WWW ethic. The situation
regarding museums, information and the WWW could be see as having certain
parallels with the situation and feelings still engendered by the issue of
free access, partially free access, access by donation or ticketed charging
for entrance to museums and galleries. Equally it can be argued that
charging for publications associated with exhibitions and collections is
the norm. </p>

<p>This paper takes the example (and experience so far) of the ITEM (Image
TEchnology in Museums and art galleries) database, developed from a twice
yearly hard copy text-only small circulation international subscription
publication to a subscription-based WWW site, with free  public access to
the introductory screens and a sampling of the text and image knowledge
base. </p>

<p>This experience of the ITEM transformation will be used as a basis for
open discussion, considering other Museum-related examples of income
producing activities on the Web, including reference to the topic of images
and copyright / moral rights. </p>



<h2>1	A context</h2>

<p>As David Bearman wrote in his paper <i>Information Strategies and
Structures for Electronic Museums</i>  in 1995, "The past five years have
ushered in technologies that have the potential to dramatically transform
museums as cultural institutions. What will the electronically enabled
museum of the future look like to its constituencies and how will having
electronic programmes change their interaction with the museum ?" </p>

<p>An important factor that comes into the discussion is not just what the
museums will do on their own, but what sort of partnerships and coalitions
will they be exploring and exploiting as between themselves and with
outside third parties - whether these are traditional partners (eg book
publishers) or new media partners.  Furthermore, what will be the
organisational, and commercial basis for such partnerships and coalitions ?
</p>

<p>At the beginning of the decade, the discussion and speculation involved
very few museums, galleries and publishers; it was based on analogue
resources and videodisk; it involved very few national partnerships and no
international collaborations.  The rapid development of digital imaging,
CD-ROM (and CD-i, now historically in much the same position as videodisk)

resulted in a rapid but modest scale of development in museum-related
digital publishing that produced (and continues to produce) a small number
of imaginative and worthwhile publications (including some significant
museum public information systems).  However, the small scale market and a
rash of "coffee table" or just plain inadequate publications, has failed to
make sufficient commercial impact to gain the necessary shelf display space
in crucial retail outlets, has led to downward spiralling pricing and to
many instances of financial failures. It has been said that 95% of all
commercially published CD-ROMs lose money. </p>

<p>Meanwhile as we progress through the second half of the decade, the WWW
is opening up enormous new opportunities for museums and galleries
(including the full plethora of on-line commerce) - but with organisational
and cost implications that require radical rethinking of museum and gallery
objectives. </p>

<p>Throughout these developments, key issues have been and will continue to
be the development  and national / international adoption of data standards
that will facilitate interoperability and the "sensible" resolution of the
ramifications of intellectual property rights. </p>


<h2>2	The establishment of IVAIN</h2>

<p>Following research in Europe and the USA in 1989/90 on the developing
use of image databases and interactive multimedia in the context of museums
and art galleries, in May 1990
I organised a meeting in Amsterdam which brought together people from art
museums and cultural authorities from nine European countries to discuss
common interests in the future development and application of interactive
multimedia in art museums. It was agreed that better access to information
about what was being developed and being planned in this field
internationally would help to maximise the effective investment  of scarce
resources (time and money), encourage the development of educational uses
(within and outside the gallery environment), avoid wasteful duplication of
effort in the planning and implementation of projects and encourage wider
international collaboration. </p>

<p>The Amsterdam meeting led to the setting up of what has now become the
International Visual Arts Information Network  (IVAIN), with objectives
that included : </p>
<ul><li>increasing knowledge of what is happening and being planned in the
use of new image-based public and management  information systems in Art
Museums internationally.</li></ul>

<i><p>Following the meeting, IVAIN immediately took steps to compile and
publish the ITEM database. ITEM has, since 1990 been compiled and published
as a twice yearly hard copy text only reference work on subscription. In
October 1996 ITEM knowledge base changed to a WWW text and image site
incorporating extensive search and other facilities - on a subscription
basis but with free-access sampling.</I></p>
<ul><li>helping to draw wider attention to the complex subject of
intellectual property rights (copyright and moral rights) relating to all
aspects of the development and use of image databases and seek ways of
assisting international progress on this.</li></ul>
<i><p>Since its first paper, for the 1990 Amsterdam meeting, IVAIN has been
involved with the wider implications of Intellectual Property Rights,
digital imaging and interactive multimedia resources,
through published articles, conference papers, presentations and
discussions at conferences in many parts of the world.  IVAIN is also a
signatory of the Memorandum of Understanding  on Multi-media Access to
Europe's Cultural Heritage facilitated by the European Commission
(DG XIII and DGX) and vice chair of the Working Group on ownership and
protection of IPR.</I></p>

<ul><li>initiating the development of an interactive multimedia twentieth
century art information project that explored the opportunities, problems
and economic advantages of an international collaboration in this field and
provide a practical way of exploring the outstanding questions
and problems associated with Intellectual Property Rights in this
area.</li></ul>
<i><p>IVAIN initiated and led an international interactive multimedia
collaborative Project. on the sculptor Constantin Brancusi. This set out to
create a significant education and publishing (as well as curatorial and
specialist research) resource on a major figure in the history and
development of twentieth century art.  It was planned as a museum-resident
public information resource and as a published CD-ROM intended to coincide,
in 1995, with the first major retrospective exhibition (in Paris and
Philadelphia) for 25 years of the work of Brancusi.</I></p>
<p><i>The Development Partners included : the Romanian Ministry of Culture
and the National Museum of Art, Bucharest;  Musée National d'Art Moderne,
Centre Georges Pompidou,   Paris  (MNAM);  Philadelphia Museum of Art;
IVAIN, Ipswich+London.  Pilot technical production was undertaken by
partners in London, Rome, Berlin and Dublin.</i></p>
<p><i>The Brancusi Project had the Patronage of the International Council
of Museums  (ICOM) and was awarded the EUREKA Audiovisual label.  The
demonstrator stages received financial and other assistance from the Henry
Moore Sculpture Trust, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office London, British
Telecommunications plc, KPMG Peat Marwick - and from many art museums and
art historians in Europe and the USA.  The completed Definition phase of
its development was financially supported by the IMPACT 2 Programme of the
EU. </i></p>


<h2>3	The development of ITEM</h2>

<p>In pursuance of the first of the IVAIN objectives, the Image TEchnology
in Museums and art galleries database (ITEM) was set up to provide and
extensive information resource on uses of image technology and interactive
multimedia to enhance the value of Art Gallery and Museum collections and
exhibitions for visitors, to provide better collection management and
research resources for staff and to provide information on multimedia
publications, with particular reference to art. </p>

<p>ITEM has been produced in hard copy (text only) twice yearly since 1990,
co-published with CIDOC and has museum, library, university and industry
subscribers in 22 countries world-wide. </p>

<p>The setting up of ITEM in 1990 was made possible with the help of modest
grants from the European Cultural Foundation, Amsterdam; Gulbenkian
Foundation, London; CCE, Brussels (DGX) and its continuing publication is
result of an underwriting by University College Suffolk, Ipswich of
part-time staffing costs. </p>


<h2>4	ITEM FOR WWW ? </h2>

<h3>4.1</h3>
<p> "The Internet goldrush has started, with corporations racing each other
for a slice of the on-line world.  And the prize for success is attractive:
according to reports. some £170 billion / $255 billion) of sales will be
generated by Internet commerce within the next few years - that's actual
Web transaction from on-line customers.  Yet for some, the digital
landscape is proving more than a little barren, with tales of failed Web
ventures becoming the modern-day business bogeyman. So is Internet commerce
the superhighway to fortune, or nothing more than a glitter of fool's gold
?" </p>
<p><i>(Matthew Bath, Internet commerce: truth or dare?, Internet Age,
London, February 1997) </i></p>

<p>While statistics have to be looked at with caution, hopefully they can
give some indication of trends and must form part of the context of our
discussion of Museums and the Web. </p>

<p>The UK DTI sponsored Information Society initiative says that in June
1996, 62 million
people were using the Internet and estimate that this will rise to up to
one billion people and virtually all businesses on-line by the year 2000.
</p>

<p>KPMG Management Consultants say that 59% of companies have allocated a
marketing budget to the Internet and the average spend is predicted to
increase by 300% over the next 5 years.
The UK WebSite Consultancy says that planned budgets average £56,000 per
year, with actual; budgets for sites already built averaging £22,700. </p>

<p>On-line specialist Jupiter Communications predicts that the total number
of on-line households world-wide will nearly triple, rising from 23.4
million in 1996 to 66.6 million in the year 2000, They see the biggest
market continuing to be the USA, with 15.4 million households last year
translating to 36 million in 2000, but the US share of the world market in
this period falling from 62.8% to 54.1% .  In Europe they predict the main
markets of France, Germany and the UK growing from 3.7 to 16.5 million
households - a compound annual growth rate of nearly 50%.
Jupiter sees the
UK  from 682,000 to 4.3 million
Germany from 2 million to 6.9 million
France (excluding Minitel)  from 170,000 to 1.2 million.
Pacific Rim showing a small share of the total, rising from 14% to 15%, but
in absolute numbers from 3.2 million to 10 million. </p>

<p>Whatever selection of statistics you like to take, we all know that WWW
is still seen as being in the ascendant, that many people see a large
question mark over the future of CD-ROMs, that CD-i is dead (except
possibly for niche training markets), that DVD is an, as yet, unknown
future but that great things are predicted ... and so on. </p>


<p> (ITEM WWW Home Page - main menu) </p>


<p>We also know that advertising on WWW is not proving  (at least so far)
the crock of gold that was forecast and perhaps for pornography which
might, so far. be considered the success story of commercial exploitation
of subscription-based information on WWW. </p>

<h3>4.2</h3>	
<p>IVAIN did not have (and still hasn't) any delusions that it is going to
make its fortune with ITEM on WWW but we do believe that we can reach a
very much wider and more diverse user-base and in doing so more fully
justify the idealism, sweat, toil, and ambition that drives us and
alleviate some of the pain and frustration!  We also hope that we can
achieve at least an improved economic future. </p>


<h2>5	DEVELOPMENT of ITEM on WWW</h2>

<p> "Electronic publishing not only promises great increases in the value
of information but also the advancement of a virtual marketplace based on
quality information.  As we face the Information Society, however, problems
of information overload and disorientation are increasing.  Today's online
content is often untargeted, difficult to find, and of questionable quality
and relevance." </p>
<i>(Electronic Publishing: Strategic Developments for the European
Publishing Industry towards the Year 2000.  European Commission, Brussels -
Luxembourg, 1996)</i></P>

<i>"I was very impressed by your IVAIN ITEM database.  It seems to be a
very useful resource." </i>

<h3>5.1	underlying considerations</h3>

<p>While ITEM was providing the most extensive reference resource on the
world-wide use of image databases and interactive multimedia in its field,
it became increasingly clear that images in the
form of screen shots to give some indication of the "look and feel" and the
range of facilities of
the projects and publications described were becoming a necessity.  With
the rapidly accelerating in-house use and publication of IT text and image
resources about art and related subjects by museums and commercial
production by traditional and new IT publishers, it also became clear that
more frequent update facilities than a twice-yearly publication were
needed. </p>

<h3>5.2	development options</h3>

<p>In first looking at these more than two years ago. WWW was a very much
less likely course at that time.  Further discussions (parallel with the
development of WWW)  led to the concept of an annual CD-ROM with linked WWW
regular updating. </p>

<p>Although from an archiving and several other practical viewpoints we
would like to have included a CD-ROM version as some element of the
package, economic considerations (ITEM is compiled and published on a
totally nominal budget) and the rapid development and take-up of WWW led to
the decision to concentrate our attention and efforts on a continuously
updated WWW site. </p>

<p>We had no delusions about the fact that any process of transformation
involving lead-edge and rapidly evolving technology on a nominal budget
would be a fraught and probably painful process.
We were encouraged by initial reactions to our plans from an international
media organisation from whom we were receiving some help on another
project.  Unfortunately a major policy review led to their cutting back on
their scope and staffing.  The person who had started working with us on
the software programming generously agreed to continue working on the
development of ITEM but we found ourselves in a communication web
stretching from Brussels to Ipswich and London and subsequently also
involving Bordeaux and Paris. </p>

<h3>5.3	scope  </h3>

<p><i>This looks like developing into a really useful resource for anyone
contemplating a public access system for a museum, but why limit it to just
the arts? The problems of scientific and technical museums are very
similar." </i></p>

<p>Since the launch of ITEM in 1990, it has been very difficult to know
where to draw the line as to what is included and what is not - and who
should realistically be the target audiences for ITEM. </p>

<p> (ITEM search menu and Titles listing) </p>



<p>Our feeling was that ITEM would be of more value if we used our very
limited resources to work within certain confines that set out to cover
possibly relatively narrowly  defined areas in as much depth as possible,
rather than a wide scope covered thinly.   This has, so far, resulted in
ITEM being described as primarily concerned with the visual arts in the
context of collection image databases, museum IT public information
resources, publications about the visual arts and their context and
research projects that include applied art, archaeology and aspects
relating more widely to the visual arts, such as Art Theft. </p>

<p>At the outset, because there were a comparatively small number of
projects in all, other museum and related projects were included where they
might have a relevance to application in the visual arts field.  With the
emergence of PhotoCD, it started to become difficult to know where to draw
the line as some digital publications were little more than captioned slide
collections. </p>

<p>The now rapid development of museum and artists' sites on WWW raises
questions as to whether ITEM should seek to cover some or any of these.
The complication is where to draw a line  as to where a line is drawn as to
when museums become interesting resources in their own right, rather than
just a floorplan, opening hours, forthcoming events listing, a small
sampling of the collections and a museum shop site - or when artists' sites
offer information relevant to the scope of ITEM. </p>

<p>Clearly there is no point in ITEM duplicating the excellent work of
listings such as the Global Virtual Library Museums Directory   URL
http://www.icom.org/vlmp
It will be interesting to see how projects such as the UK site ADAM (art,
design, architecture & media information gateway)develop their role.
URL:<a href="http://adam.ac.uk/"> http://adam.ac.uk/</a>

<p>But, just as most of the CD-ROM directories of CD-ROMs do not give a
great deal of descriptive, technical or visual information about the
publications they catalogue, even the most elaborate WWW site listings do
not in themselves give much or any indication as to the "look and feel",
the resources and facilities of the sites they list.  Consequently it is
becoming a more and more daunting task to discover what is "out there".  We
are very interested to hear people's comments and suggestions on the role
ITEM might play in relation to documenting Museums sites on the Web - and
other sites involved in art and the digital image. </p>


<h3>5.4	content </h3>

<p>he content of the ITEM on WWW records obviously drew heavily on the
already established content of the hardcopy publication. The bonus of the
WWW development was the inclusion of screenshots, the search facilities and
the printout capabilities.  A further bonus is the potential of hypertext
links to relevant parts of many museum, developer and publisher sites as
well as relevant parts of ICOM, European Commission and other international
organisations. </p>

<p>The facility for return e-mail forms and responses was very important to
us and currently we have included a new and updated record entry form, a
subscription form and an evaluation response questionnaire as well as,
optimistically, a Bulletin Board. </p>


<h3>5.5	design considerations</h3>

<p><i>" I think it's very nicely constructed and the scope is quite broad.
My first thoughts were, here's a great example of how to package and
deliver metadata." </i></p>

<p><i>"I thought this was a very well presented site, the layout was good
and the quality of the reproductions good.  As someone still fairly new to
the electronic environment I was also impressed how user-friendly it
was."</i></p>

<p><i>"Generally nice and clean.  Nor overburdened with heavy graphics and
the frames work well" </i></p>


<p> (ITEM sample record, page 1) </p>

<p> (ITEM sample record, page 2) </p>


<p>What should ITEM on WWW actually look like : a re-vamped text document,
a slick database, a cousin of WIRED...?  As with CD-ROMs, some WWW projects
are "overpackaged" in relation to their actual content, while others are
under-resourced in content. </p>

<p>The brief we established was based our view that the important factors
were that visually the main impact needed to be the screenshot images and
the ease of searching and reading of the records. </p>

<p>The need for speed of access ruled out extravagant graphics as the
screenshots would anyway add considerably to the access time. </p>

<p>We felt that the screen shots as thumbnail Gifs) should be of sufficient
size to at least give a feeling of the particular resource, with the added
facility of half-screen JPEG enlargements.
In most cases this would mean that the images could be reasonably viewed
and in many cases the text would be readable. </p>

<p>We had originally planned to undertake the design development in
partnership with a relevant new MA design and IT programme but the course
plans were delayed and we had to proceed on our own. However, we are still
interested in such a collaboration for the further development of ITEM.
</p>


<h3>5.6	IPR (copyright and moral rights)</h3>

<p>We worked with the specialist IT department of a leading UK law firm,
Bird & Bird
URL: <a href="http://www.twobirds.com/"> http://www.twobirds.com </a>
on the basic copyright information and disclaimers for the site. </p>

<p>Understandably, many museums, publishers and other underlying rights
holders are nervous about images going on the WWW.  The big test for ITEM
would be whether we could achieve a sufficient positive response to our
initial requests for images for the relaunch on WWW, that would then lead
to others following with their agreement.  It was interesting to see how
few publishers had cleared rights for at least a small range of screenshots
for use in publicity and marketing.  If people could not see anything, what
incentive was there for them to purchase the CD-ROM publications?  In
relation to museum information resources that were not published for
retail, why produce something and then not show it to anyone beyond your
walls?
Clearly, these are over simplistic questions, but they do help to highlight
some of the dilemmas that are currently occupying the minds of many people.
</p>

<p> copyright line appears above the thumbnail screen shot section of each
ITEM record, but the size and limited quality would make such images of no
commercial and little other value if used out of this context.  The half
screen JPEGs incorporate a copyright line in the border which is an
integral part of the image, so that any downloading would include the
copyright line.  While it is true that this could be subsequently retouched
out, again the limited reference quality of the image does not make it of
any commercial value.  We did consider watermarking but felt that at these
resolutions it was not necessary.  However, with the incorporation of a
watermarking facility in Photoshop v.6 this is an option we may reconsider.
</p>

<p>In this context it is interesting to see the basis on which SCRAN
(Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network)  URL
http://www.nms.ac.uk/scran/   are working on image resolution and copyright
in their £15 million (half from the UK Lottery) project to digitise large
parts of Scotland's collections.  SCRAN feel that once images are on WWW
they are effectively in the public domain and they are working with three
levels of definition : </p>
<OR><li>web
<li>educational quality   (by site licence)
<li>commercial quality    (fee based)</li></OL>


<h2>6	SELLING OUR INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET</h2>

<p>In devising policy for ITEM on WWW we started from the reality of an
existing base of a modest number of subscribers spread over 22 countries
world-wide for the twice yearly hard-copy version - was becoming
increasingly expensive to produce and mail . </p>

<p>While the subscriber geographical spread was good the numbers had to be
increased to justify the investment of time and other resources. </p>

<p>A series of scenarios were explored, on the basis of the technology
available or about to become available. </p>

<table border=1>
<tr>
<th align="CENTER" valign="MIDDLE">
</th>
<th align="CENTER" valign="MIDDLE">
</th>
<th align="CENTER" valign="MIDDLE">
</th></tr>


<hr>
<h4>annual subscription only</h4>
<b>pros:</b>relatively simple<br>
<b>cons:</b>eliminates real contact with potential users and future subscribers

<h4>annual subscription plus guest access</h4>
<b>pros:</b>wider potential<br>
<b>cons:</b>user/subscriber contact	

<h4>"encryption envelopes" for "sealing"
information/product which can only  be
downloaded once payment has been made.</h4>
<i>At the time ITEM on WWW was being planned, the then existing secure
payments (eg on Netscape) while relatively safe, were viewed with great
suspicion by most people.</i>

<h4>free- but per-element access</h4>
<b>pros:</b>maximises contact<br>
<b>cons:</b> as yet an unfamiliar process
	<i>(micro payments / "millicent" payments) eg 2p or 0.2 (anonymous digital
cash)
	(micro payments now being trialled by Visa, Mastercard, Netscape, Microsoft
	cost of brokerage ?
	none of these micro payment options were effectively available at the time
we had to make initial decisions.</i>

<h4> free - but develop on-line and off-line cd-rom sales *</h4>
<b>pros:</b> ties in with ITEM as information provider<br>
<b>cons:</b> capital intensive servicing intensive high risk
<hr>						
* 	A typical worldwide CD-ROM mail order distributor in the UK may list
1750-1800 CD-ROMs,
	of which the Arts category may account for 60 titles (3.3%).
	ITEM currently lists 120 CD-ROMs titles available for purchase worldwide.
<hr>

<p>There was then the question of the attitude of :
providers of data to each of these scenarios - although they would be
getting free promotion
(but should ITEM charge for hypertext links to their WWW sites (including
their sales sites) ?
subscribers to each of these scenarios including the natural nervousness of
on-line payment and the unfamiliarity with micro payments. </p>

<p>We chose to develop ITEM on the basis of free access to the introductory
screens, guest access to a small (regularly changing) same of ITEM records
and our searches, with  full access on an annual subscription password
basis. </p>



<h2>7	SOME REALITIES</h2>

<p> "Finally I am able to get through to ITEM: the result is wonderful" </p>

<p> "We jumped in at the deep end.  We have succeeded, with very little
funding and an erratic staffing situation, in launching a sophisticated and
complex site of which we can be proud.  How the future will develop with
regard to financial returns remains to be seen.  Do not consider such an
ambitious project unless you have access to dedicated and enthusiastic
staff and be prepared to accept that problems can sometimes be painfully
slow to resolve." <p><i>(Sue Hagley,  Administrator,  IVAIN) </i></p>

<p>If you are providing a site which has access (or part access) by
charging in some form, then the text and image data resources, the ability
to manipulate that data, the speed of access, ease of navigation and the
quality of presentation take on a far greater importance.</p>


<h3>7.1	programming</h3>

<p>To what extent can the necessary programme development and
implementation be successfully carried out on a part-time consultancy basis
and part-time in-house technical staffing ? </p>

<p>With the rapid development of HTML authoring tools and editing packages,
that aspect is becoming monthly more straightforward to realise. Linked
image files and compolex search facilities are still a far more complex
challenge.  The achieving of typographical precision and niceties is
gradually becoming less frustrating but the on-screen variations between
use of Netscape and Internet Explorer and from one computer to another
continue to be a major frustration to producers and users.  We, like a
number of others, are having to accept the fact that, at least for the time
being, it is necessary to go to the lengths of providing the option on the
home page of access to versions optimised for either Netscape 3 or Internet
Explorer 3. </p>


<h3>7.2	server and web-site management</h3>

<p>Despite goodwill and practical help, unless your site is one of the core
responsibilities of the computer site that houses your server, problems
will inevitably arise.  They will arise anyway, but just more so !  And who
would have anticipated two major power failures...
ITEM was originally launched end October/beginning November.  Then because
of technical problems a new server and site had to be set arranged, giving
rise to a new URL and the time consuming task of informing subscribers,
press, search engines, listserves, and other sites with hypertext links to
ITEM, not to mention the sites who carried links to ITEM, of which we were
not aware. </p>


<h3>7.3	investment</h3>

<p>Many of our problems arose from undertaking an ambitious development on
a nominal budget.
Goodwill may be plentiful, but will it ensure that others can prioritise
the solution of your needs and problems when it comes to a crunch ? </p>


<h3>7.4	data and image collection</h3>

<p><i>"This is a great way, I expect, to keep the ITEM entries up-to-date,
since the contributors will now have strong reasons (seeing it on screen)
to make it accurate and keep it so."</i></p>

<p><i> Regarding the image quality issue - they are adequate for what I
assumed is the purpose - to bring the viewer to the next step of deciding
they want to see the thing from its source." </i></p>

<p>One of the biggest problems, as others have found in comparable
circumstances, is the time intensive data gathering and verification - to
which we were now adding the complication of the obtaining and handling of
images, in a variety of carrier sources and formats. </p>

<p>We certainly hope that museums and other producers and associated
publishers will recognise the value to them, as well as to their potential
audiences and markets, of being well represented in ITEM. </p>


<h3>7.5	subscribing</h3>
<p><i> "I looked at the site when you first informed us about it, but was a
bit daunted by having to figure out how to send money - you'd get more
subscribers if you could offer subscription via credit card." </i></p>

<p>As a small organisation, we do not have clearing arrangements with the
major credit cards - a definite problem in selling on line subscriptions
and one which we will have to resolve very quickly. </p>



<h2>8	THE FUTURE - and the PROSPECTS</h2>

<p>I had hoped to be able to be able to quote extensive (and exciting)
statistics,
but the site breakdown following the successful trial weeks and initial
launch in November 1996 have set back our timetable but some statistics
will be available for the presentation at the Conference. </p>

<p>We have recharged our optimism with the relaunch at the end of January
1997 and are looking forward to the fruits of two years of hard work and
many frustrations. </p>

<p>We hope that the next twelve months will see the introduction of a
Multi-lingual ITEM and international organisational links / collaborations
with others, together with user feedback that will form the basis for the
further development of ITEM and its user base.</p>
