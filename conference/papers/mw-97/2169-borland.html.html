<h1> ArtsEdNet: Assessing an Arts Education Web Site</h1>



<h2>I. What is ArtsEdNet?</h2>

<p>ArtsEdNet is an online service produced by the Getty Education Institute
for the Arts.  It is designed for educators involved in K-12 arts education
including art specialists, general classroom teachers using the arts,
museum educators and university faculty involved in preservice arts
education and curriculum materials development. ArtsEdNet currently
consists of two major components: the ArtsEdNet Web site and an e-mail
based discussion group called ArtsEdNet Talk.</p>

<p>By using the information distribution and interactive capabilities of
the Internet, the Getty Education Institute hopes to accomplish several
primary goals:</p>

<ul><li> Provide teachers with ready access to a large number of high
quality arts education classroom resources (lesson units, curriculum ideas,
online images) that they can easily incorporate into their curricula.</li>

<li>Provide an online discussion forum for arts educators so they could
connect and communicate with their colleagues.  This is a particularly
important service for arts educators who are usually very thinly spread and
do not often have opportunities to talk with their colleagues in the "real"
world.</li>

<li> Develop the ability to provide over the Internet beginning,
intermediate, and advanced professional development to teachers who use the
arts in their curricula.</li></ul>

<p>ArtsEdNet was launched in September 1995. Eighteen months after its
inception, the ArtsEdNet Web site contains over 1,200 text pages and 800
graphics files. Much of the site embodies a wide array of curriculum
resources built around images of artworks provided by several museums,
artists, and cultural organizations around the world.  In addition,
ArtsEdNet provides teachers with excerpts of articles and books on the
theory and practice of art education, advocacy materials to help teachers
win support for art education in the schools, links to other art and
education related Web sites on the Internet, and other arts education
related materials. ArtsEdNet Talk has become a large and very active e-mail
discussion group which focuses on topics of interest to K-12 arts
educators.</p>

<p>In order to begin learning how to provide professional development over
the Internet, the Getty Education Institute has also created a number of
special programs for ArtsEdNet on topics of interest to our target
audience.  These generally include a special ArtsEdNet Web site exhibition
on a topic and related discussions via e-mail among arts education experts,
artists, and practitioners.</p>

<h2>II. Assessment Approaches and Issues</h2>

<p>Like all Web site developers, the Institute needs to know how well its
Web site is accomplishing its goals. Since the early prototyping of
ArtsEdNet, we have tried a number of approaches to assessing the
effectiveness of the site in reaching and helping teachers. Below are some
of the techniques we have employed and comments on the limitations of each.
In the final section of this paper we review what we've learned to date
from our assessment efforts.</p>

<ul><li>Web site usage statistics</li>
<li>Web site user survey form</li>
<li>Web site Comments forms</li>
<li>Feedback Groups</li>
<li>Feedback from ArtsEdNet Talk participants</li>
<li>Questionnaires from potential visitors</li></ul>

<h3>Web site usage statistics</h3>

<p>Computer logs of Web site usage provide extensive information on what
Web pages visitors have accessed. Unfortunately there are a number of
technical limitations on the information that can be gathered automatically
which make it hard to get a clear picture of how specific individuals are
using a Web site over time. Early Web sites tried to overcome these
limitations by asking visitors to register every time they visited but
users balked and today few sites try to register their visitors.</p>

<p>Although other technological solutions to this problem are under
development, it is still not possible to get a completely accurate picture
from standard Web site logs of how many different people visit a Web site
each day, who these people are, how many and how often people revisit your
site, viewing patterns of specific individuals or specific groups of
individuals, how long specific people spend reading particular sections or
pages. These and other types of detailed viewing statistics are vital to
making realistic assessments of the effectiveness of a Web site.</p>

<p>For the ArtsEdNet Web site, we have chosen to use relatively inexpensive
software to analyze the site usage logs. The most valuable information we
have extracted from ArtsEdNet logs tells us about trends over time in the
number of visitor sessions to ArtsEdNet and any subsection of ArtsEdNet.
From these statistics we can infer roughly the size of our total audience,
the effectiveness of our marketing efforts in influencing visits to
ArtsEdNet, and the popularity of our special programs and other new content
areas.</p>

<p>A short comment on the use of visitor sessions rather than hits is
appropriate here. Some people, particularly the popular press, report the
number of hits a Web site receives as an indicator of its popularity.
However, hits are a very misleading indicator of Web site usage. A single
page on a Web site may generate many hits depending on how it is designed
and how many graphic files are involved. Thus, the number of hits for a Web
page does not necessarily correlate with how many times people downloaded
that page, since the page design can produce multiple hits. A Web site with
different types of pages may have different total hits for each page.
Consequently, the total number of hits for the site does not indicate how
many individuals visited the site.</p>

<p>We have found that an estimate of visitor sessions, a statistic provided
by most Web site log analysis packages, is a much more useful tool. An
ArtsEdNet visitor session begins when a visitor accesses a page on the
site. As the visitor continues to move through ArtsEdNet pages, our Web
site log analysis package, WebTrends, monitors the pages that the visitor
accesses. WebTrends determines that the session is over once this visitor
has not asked for any pages for a half hour. If the visitor returns later,
a new visitor session is counted. </p>

<p>We encountered the dramatic difference between counting hits and visitor
sessions soon after we redesigned ArtsEdNet in September 1996. One of our
aims had been to reduce the number of non-essential graphical design
elements used on each page. After the redesign, we saw that ArtsEdNet
experienced a significant decline in hits while simultaneously registering
a steady increase in visitor sessions. </p>

<p>For various technical reasons having to do with how the Internet works,
the number visitor sessions is not a precise count of all the unique
individuals who access a Web site.  It does seems to be, however, the best
indicator of Web site usage available that is relatively easy to capture
from Web site logs.</p>

<h3>Web site user survey form</h3>

<p>While Web site usage logs can give us estimates of how many people are
looking at what on a Web site, they tell us nothing about who these people
are. Are they part of one's target audience or are they virtual tourists
just out to look at the pretty pictures? We decided to put a short user
survey on ArtsEdNet which people could fill out voluntarily. It asks people
to tell us their profession so that we can determine how many of our
visitors are in our target audience. </p>

<p>Unfortunately a very low proportion of our total visitors fill out this
short survey. We did find that significant number of people who identify
themselves as parents interested in art education fill out the survey form,
a finding we had not expected. As expected a large number of survey
respondents are teachers. However, we just do not get enough responses to
our online survey to give us a reliable estimate of the proportion of our
online audience from various professional groups. We are now trying to
invent other ways to get this kind of information, but no easy solution
presents itself. </p>

<h3>Web site Comments forms</h3>

<p>We also include on every page of ArtsEdNet a Comments Button and an
ArtsEdNet e-mail address which visitors can use to send us comments. We
average about 30 comments a month plus over 100 e-mail messages in the same
time period. The subjects of these messages vary widely; some have very
little, if anything, to do with ArtsEdNet. In general unsolicited Comments
have not been particularly useful as an assessment tool, but they do
provide an easy way for our audience to send us messages when they want to.
Many send us very nice comments and a few have found typographical errors
that we missed. Many of the art education questions we receive we suggest
that the sender resubmit to the ArtsEdNet Talk discussion group where a
group of active and experienced teachers may be able to help them.</p>

<h3>Feedback Groups</h3>

<p>Since the inception of ArtsEdNet we have put together a special Feedback
Groups of 20 people from various professions that comprise our target
audience. These are essentially online focus groups. Each group serves for
six months and provides us with responses to detailed questions we send
them about various aspects of ArtsEdNet functioning. So far we have sought
out people who are already interested in arts education and ArtsEdNet and
can provide us with feedback from the standpoint of a frequent ArtsEdNet
user who is well acquainted with all of its components. These Feedback
Groups have proven invaluable in helping us assess the overall design and
use of the ArtsEdNet Web site and responses to specific ArtsEdNet programs
and content areas.</p>

<h3>Feedback from ArtsEdNet Talk participants</h3>

<p>ArtsEdNet Talk now has close to 700 subscribers. The volume of messages
exchanged each month currently exceeds 650. Participants sign up for the
e-mail discussion group automatically and so we do not have any survey data
about who these people are and what they do for a living. However, we have
learned a great deal by analyzing the e-mail conversation that takes place.
Many people sign their e-mail messages with their full name, address, and
professional title. Also we can infer much about who the audience is and
what they are interested in from the content of their online conversation.
It is clear that most of the people who contribute to the conversation are
K-12 art teachers plus university faculty who train K-12 teachers in the
arts, plus some general classroom teachers interested in teaching art, and
some museum educators. Conversation flows around a wide variety of issues
involved in teaching the arts, primarily but not exclusively the visual
arts, in K-12 classrooms.</p>

<p>We have been very conservative about sending online surveys to our
ArtsEdNet Talk participants in order to minimize intrusion into the
discussion process. However, we have sent a few short surveys which have
resulted in the usual small percentage of responses. We are now trying to
think of ways we can motivate more of our participants to complete an
online survey.</p>

<h3>Questionnaires from potential visitors</h3>

<p>In order to assess how well ArtsEdNet is known in our current and
potential target audiences and how these audiences are connected to the
Internet we have done a few surveys at professional conferences.  These
surveys were completed by conference participants who visited the Getty
Education Institute booth and so are not necessarily representative of the
population of conference participants as a whole.  However, for the
questions we asked we felt that the booth visitors'responses should be
suggestive of those of the target population as a whole.</p>

<h2>III. What have we learned about how teachers use ArtsEdNet?</h2>

<h3>Who uses the ArtsEdNet Web site?</h3>

<p>It is clear that most of the participants in ArtsEdNet Talk are from our
target audience of K-12 art educators, museum educators, and university
faculty who train art educators. Our user survey form on the ArtsEdNet Web
site reveals that a large percentage of visitors who respond to the survey
are from our target audience. However, the proportion of respondents to
this survey is so small that we have no faith in the accuracy of this
percentage. We can infer the professional interest of our visitors by
observing what information they seek when they do get on ArtsEdNet.</p>

<h3>What information do visitors seek when teachers get on ArtsEdNet?</h3>

<p>A breakdown of ArtsEdNet usage by section and subsection shows that the
Classroom Resources Section is, far and away, the most popular section on
ArtsEdNet. It is followed in use by the Browsing Room which contains
extracts of articles and books on the theory and practice of art education.
From this we can infer that the Web site is primarily used by our target
audience. </p>

<p>We also conclude from multiple data sources that teachers want detailed
lesson units and curriculum ideas that they can use in their classrooms
without a great deal of additional work on their part. Most teachers just
do not have time to do a great deal of curriculum development. Images of
art works and catalog data about them are not of much use to K-12 teachers
unless these are placed in the context of a complete lesson unit. In fact,
to facilitate the use of art resources on the Internet, these ideally would
be presented in the context of lesson units tied to local, state and
national curriculum frameworks and standards. The more lesson units easily
fit into existing curricula the more likely teachers are to use them.  </p>

<p>We also have heard teachers express an interest in curricula that
integrate the arts with other subjects. ArtsEdNet does not yet provide any
truly interdisciplinary units and we are very aware of the difficulty of
creating such units that treat all of the disciplines involved in a
meaningful way. We are particularly concerned that art is used as more than
just decoration in interdisciplinary curricula.</p>

<h3>From what location do teachers access ArtsEdNet?</h3>

<p>Our surveys, some of them close to a year old, show that a majority of
teachers are accessing the Internet from home. 92% of survey respondents at
the National Art Education Association Conference (NAEA) and at the
International Reading Association (IRA) conference said that they had
access to a computer. Roughly 40% of teachers said they used e-mail
regularly and 30% said they used the Web regularly.  However, of these
respondents only 14% reported having Internet access in their classrooms.
About 18% had access from the school library and eighteen percent had
access from a school media lab.  There was remarkable consistency between
these percentages for the NAEA and the IRA groups.</p>

<p>What these figures tell us is that most teachers are forced to use the
Internet as a research tool for curriculum development because they do not
have the equipment and connectivity to use the Internet directly in the
classroom.  These teachers need to be able to print out lesson plans and
background materials and they need to be able to acquire prints or slides
of the art works involved so that they can use the lesson plans they find
on the Internet in their classrooms.  Some teachers do print images from
ArtsEdNet on their inexpensive color printers but the results are very poor
when compared with the typical museum print. </p>

<p>In the coming five years we can expect the number of Internet connected
classrooms to grow steadily as local and national initiatives to connect
America's classrooms begin to bear fruit.  Once teachers are connected, the
way they use the Internet changes significantly over time. Based on our anec
dotal data from ArtsEdNet Talk and personal contacts, some teachers with
Internet access in their classrooms use ArtsEdNet as a large, easily
accessible slide library which they can use in the context of the lesson
plans we provide. Many of these teachers also want the lesson plans
provided to include extensive links to related resources on the Internet so
they can take advantage of the breadth of art resources found there. Some
teachers want to have their students conduct research on the Internet
directly as part of an inquiry process. These teachers are interested in
lesson plans that include online activities designed for students to carry
out under the guidance of the teacher. As the number of Internet connected
classrooms grows and teachers gain experience with the breadth of
information available there, we can expect that teachers will find many new
and innovative ways to use the Internet for arts education.</p>

<h3>Who uses the ArtsEdNet Talk e-mail discussion group?</h3>

<p>As stated above we do not have a comprehensive profile of the
demographics of who uses ArtsEdNet Talk. However, based on the topics of
conversation and the signature files of those who contribute messages, it
is clear that participants are K-12 art teachers, some classroom teachers
and museum educators, and university faculty responsible for preservice
arts education.</p>

<h3>What do ArtsEdNet Talk participants talk about?</h3>

<p>Virtually all of the messages to ArtsEdNet Talk address topics involved
in K-12 arts education classroom practices. These cover a wide span of
issues including: materials and procedures for various art making
exercises, techniques for garnering more support for art programs in
schools, block scheduling and its impact on art programs, questions about
specific facts, resources, and techniques for teaching art history,
criticism and aesthetics, how to mentor teacher trainees, and how to get
good art education into elementary schools which often have no art
specialist to help the general classroom teacher.</p>

<p>Overall ArtsEdNet Talk appears to have created a quite lively online
community among those involved in K-12 arts education. Teachers often send
us messages about how much they appreciate the opportunity to communicate
online with their colleagues about art education issues.</p>

<h3>Has ArtsEdNet Talk been successful at training teachers in how to
deliver arts education?</h3>

<p>We do not know the answer to this question and it is really too soon
tell.  The evidence we have to date involves the amount of participation on
ArtsEdNet special programs. The Getty Education Institute has created a
series of special programs for ArtsEdNet that focus on issues in teaching
the arts such as: teaching students to interpret and criticize art through
the work of a contemporary artist; teaching students to understand art from
various perspectives through a comparison of the work a contemporary
Mexican-American artist and Navajo weaving; how to teach using
inquiry-based and thematic learning techniques; and how to develop
authentic multicultural understanding through an exploration of the art of
different cultures.  ArtsEdNet Web exhibitions for these programs generally
include images of relevant art works plus lesson plans or curriculum
resources of some kind. These programs all contain an interactive component
in which some combination of  university faculty with expertise in art
education or one of the art disciplines, artists, curriculum development
specialists, and practicing teachers discuss issues raised by the program.
ArtsEdNet Talk participants are encouraged to submit their comments and
questions also.  Overall the programs are designed to engage the ArtsEdNet
audience in an online mini seminar of sorts.</p>

<p>How are teachers participating in these programs? Our Web site usage
logs show that these exhibitions are quite popular and are visited
increasingly, even after the most interactive portion of the program is
over. Participation in the online discussions by ArtsEdNet Talk
participants has grown over time. Initial programs received a small number
of excellent comments and questions. We observed that it might take a month
or so for participants to begin discussing a program topic and so we needed
to allow for a longer time span for the interactive component of online
programs to unfold. In recent programs we have experimented with having
panels of experts and teacher practitioners engage in an active online
discussion of issues instead of just waiting for questions. This has worked
very well so far, although we again observed that most of the discussion by
people not on the panel started after the one month panel was over.</p>

<p>At the moment we plan to continue to experiment with program formats and
topics to determine what process and content is most effective in engaging
teachers in substantive discussions of issues.  Once we have a better idea
of what works in terms of engaging our audience we will begin on the
difficult task of trying to assess how these programs affect classroom
performance.</p>

<h2>IV. Implications for Museum Web Sites</h2>

<p>Based on our assessments of ArtsEdNet, we can make the following
suggestions for Museum Web sites that wish to serve K-12 teachers:</p>

<h3>Provide curriculum materials to go with the images of your holdings.</h3>

<p>Most museum sites provide images of parts of their collection along with
some small amount of historical data about each.  If a good search facility
is provided such databases might be of some use to advanced students doing
research. But for the majority of K-12 teachers and students this is not
enough to be useful. You must provide materials that show teachers how to
use your Web site in the classroom-the more detailed the better.
Experienced teachers can much more easily transform your lesson unit into
something that works for them than start building lesson units from scratch
around your materials.  Museum education departments generally have very
extensive experience with school groups and teachers and may well be able
to transform existing materials they have already developed for use on
their museums' Web sites.</p>

<h3>As you develop curriculum materials try to incorporate multiple
teaching approaches.</h3>

<p>From multiple sources we have heard that teachers using the Internet
appear to move away from delivering straight lectures and toward increasing
student interactivity. Teachers move to more inquiry-based teaching using
both teacher led discussions and student research projects that incorporate
searching traditional and Internet resources. However, teachers vary widely
in their approach. Ideally Web sites will present curriculum materials
developed to fit various teaching approaches.</p>
