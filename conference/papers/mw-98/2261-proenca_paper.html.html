          <h4>Introduction</h4></B></FONT><font face="Arial" size=3>
          <p>The main activity of museums is to present to a wide audience, sets 
            of objects that represent the cultural heritage of a particular region, 
            time or people. </p>
          <p>In Portugal, about 260 museums are engaged in these activities </FONT><a href="#b1"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>1<a name="i1"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3>. 
            Most museums are small - over 80% have only one curator and less than 
            10,000 objects - and with scarce resources - low budgets and staff 
            shortage to perform all the required tasks. They have a very wide 
            range of procedures that are adapted to the real conditions of each 
            museum: the nature of the collections, their location, and the technical 
            and support staff.</p>
          <p>Interaction with local communities is one of the main roles of small/medium 
            size museums. Solving most communication problems that a museum has 
            to face requires an understanding of social change, in order to adapt 
            them to the museum practice and to redefine the museum public.</p>
          <p>The basis of a museum's existence and activity is its collections 
            which must be accessible (both the real object and data on each object), 
            exhibited and interpreted.</p>
          <p>Exhibitions are the most common means employed by museums to communicate 
            with the public. Through exhibitions, museums provide contact between 
            the objects and the public, and "<i>virtually all museums are preoccupied 
            in one way or another with the display of their collections - or perhaps 
            one should say more accurately, of part of their collections</i>" </FONT>
            <a href="#b2"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>2<a name="i2"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3>.</p>
          <p>The new multimedia and interactive technologies represent new ways 
            museums can improve the communication with the public, to attract 
            remote (virtual) visitors, complement a real visit, and explore new 
            potentials - some only possible due to recent information technology.</p>
          <p>A common strategy is under development and implementation in North 
            Portugal: several museums are joining efforts to share the costs of 
            a move towards the new technologies, through a Science &amp; Technology 
            project, </FONT><a href="../http://www.geira.pt/" target="_top"><font face="Arial" size=3>Geira</font></a><font face="Arial" size=3> 
            </font><a href="#b3"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>3<a name="i3"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3> 
            whose aims include the use of new technologies to promote the national 
            cultural heritage.</p>
          <p>Project Geira is organised around several heritage areas: science 
            &amp; technology, documents in libraries and archives, objects and 
            its locations in museums or archaeological sites, and environment, 
            namely the geological and biological aspects. Current funds give leadership 
            of Geira to two universities: </FONT><a href="../http://www.uminho.pt/" target="_top"><font face="Arial" size=3>University 
            of Minho</font></a><font face="Arial" size=3> </font><a href="#b4"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>4<a name="i4"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3> 
            (UM) and </font><a href="../http://www.utad.pt/" target="_top"><font face="Arial" size=3>University 
            of Tr&aacute;s-os-Montes e Alto Douro</font></a><font face="Arial" size=3> 
            </font><a href="#b5"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>5<a name="i5"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3> 
            (UTAD).</p>
          <p>The museums thread in Geira has the following goals:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>
            <li>to increase the level of museum awareness of the available tools 
              in information technology. This can be achieved through workshops 
              with museum curators, the development of a documentation system 
              to catalogue and manage the museum collection, the supply of information 
              on national and EC programs to fund innovation projects, and the 
              organisation of professional training courses;</li></P>
            <p>
            <li>to promote, among curators, the use of standard and integrated 
              digital inventories of the collections that represent a national 
              cultural heritage, such as those proposed by international organisations/initiatives 
              like the Museum Documentation Association, the International Council 
              of Museums/CIDOC, the Canadian Heritage Information Network, and 
              the MoU-Multi-Media Access to Europe's Cultural Heritage (A Memorandum 
              of Understanding and European Charter);</li></P>
            <p>
            <li>to promote, among museum directors, the use of the Internet as 
              a new communication tool. This requires the development of tools 
              that let the museum staff dynamically produce their own Web pages. 
              Current results show the success of this task - in just a few months 
              several new Web pages with museums contents were created and published 
              using the same "data base template" </FONT><a href="#b6"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>6<a name="i6"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3> 
              (</font><a href="../http://www.utad.geira.pt/abadebacal" target="_top"><font face="Arial" size=3>Museu 
              Abade de Ba&ccedil;al</font></a><font face="Arial" size=3> </font><a href="#b7"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>7<a name="i7"></a></sup></FONT></a><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>

              ...);</li></P>
            <p>
            <li>to promote public access to the museum collections, through multimedia 
              and interactive presentations on the Web (and on CD-ROM's). This 
              goal is the main topic being addressed in this paper.</li></P>
          </ul>
          <p>To accomplish these goals, each thread in Geira involves collaboration 
            between institutions with the content experts and each University. 
            UM selected Museu Nogueira da Silva as a partner in Geira: it is a 
            house museum, created as a result of a donation to UM. The museum 
            collections are mainly fine arts - about 7,000 objects - but it also 
            contains a relevant photographic collection - especially old images 
            of Braga with 5,000 film negatives and glass plates. The museum has 
            only one curator, besides the director; both are in charge of all 
            museum activities. </p>
          <p>This communication mainly addresses the issue of "public access to 
            museums on the Web" and it has the following structure: section II 
            presents the traditional approach museums have adopted to be on the 
            Web, with some sample sites; section III addresses the techniques 
            curators use daily to attract visitors to their (real) museums, which 
            are further explored in the following section as good examples to 
            adapt and to implement on virtual museums, on the Web, and how these 
            guidelines were followed at a particular museum in Portugal (Museu 
            Nogueira da Silva); section V shows with a finer detail a case study 
            of the application of some of these ideas to the primary school visits; 
            section VI concludes this communication with the final remarks.</p></FONT> 
          <h4>Traditional Web approaches</h4><font face="Arial" size=3>
          <p>Several museums around the world are already committed to a strong 
            Web presence and many others will adopt one very soon. Dynamic museum 
            leaders understood that the increasing number of net surfers require 
            special attention from museums: Internet - and CD-ROM's - represent 
            new media that will challenge museum communication strategies.</p>
          <p>Two distinct Web approaches are being adopted by the museums. Some 
            regard their presence on the Web as another way to publicise the museum 
            and to promote their activities; others use the Web as a powerful 
            resource to achieve their purposes: to conserve, to study and to display.</p>
          <p>The most common attitude is to consider the Web as a simple sum of 
            the different kinds of information already in use by museums - specially 
            printed information - but gathered in a global structured way. These 
            data include a museum description and a list of activities and collections, 
            where a typical Web page structure contains: collections and exhibitions, 
            visit planning and conditions, new acquisitions, projects and activities, 
            museum organisational scheme and educational programs.</p>
          <p>Several museums on the Web follow this approach. They may not be 
            the sites that most museums would like to have, but nevertheless they 
            made an effort to use the available resources. Among them it may be 
            worth a visit to </FONT><a href="../http://www.magichouse.com/" target="_top"><font face="Arial" size=3>St.

            this site has a good image quality, but with a traditional structure 
            to present the exhibition themes. </p>
          <p>Some museums demonstrate greater innovation in their Web presences: 
            they have temporary exhibitions on-line, promote virtual visits and 
            access to their databases, present technical information for museums 
            professionals and researchers, keep available information about previous 
            activities and exhibitions, and organise links to related sites. </p>
          <p>For these museums the Web is also an exhibition and a presentation 
            medium that must be integrated in the communication policy of the 
            museum. They deserve a short presentation to comments on their strengths 
            and the interesting points they show:</p>

            referred as "edutainement"). And they must also exploit the best current 
            technology: interactivity, audio-visual and 3D capabilities.</p></FONT>

          <h4>Techniques to attract visitors</h4><font face="Arial" size=3>
          <p>Museums are considered important institutions in the preservation 
            and presentation of cultural heritage. However, traditional concepts 
            associated with the museums' role and activities are confronted with 
            social changes.</p>
          <p>Museums are usually seen as a boring place with tedious and non-interactive 
            exhibitions - that usually remain unchanged for too long, and are 
            typically designed for very specific audiences. To overcome this outside 
            view, curators and museums professionals are questioning the role 
            of a museum in the society, trying to improve their communication.</p>
          <p>Several well known techniques are being used by museums to attract 
            visitors - not only new ones, but also how to persuade actual visitors 
            to return to the museum - and some are very successful. These include 
            the organisation of:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>
            <li>exhibitions - permanent, temporary, special and loan </FONT><a href="#b21"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>21<a name="i21"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3> 
              - to give to the public close contact with art and/or heritage objects; 
            </li></P>
            <p>
            <li>entertainment and cultural events, such as concerts, conferences, 
              workshops, musical and/or audio-visual shows, ...; </li></P>
            <p>
            <li>educational programs addressed to well identified audiences, with 
              a special focus on young people, and on professional training on 
              themes where the museum or its associates have some expertise. </li></P>
          </ul>
          <p>In some museums, special attention is still devoted to the younger 
            generation - the primary school children - among the educational programs. 
            The same priority was felt at the museum acting as a Geira partner 
            - the Museu Nogueira da Silva - where a joint project with the Institute 
            of Children Studies (an academic "faculty" of UM) and four primary 
            schools, is currently running: "Look, listen and feel a museum". </p>
          <p>School projects occur at the right time to motivate younger generations 
            to enjoy visits to the museum. This project includes up to four visits 
            of a primary school class to the museum (its structure is further 
            described in section V) and it aims to develop a different attitude 
            and consequently a different opinion about a museum. </p></FONT>
          <h4>Web techniques to give life to museums</h4><font face="Arial" size=3>
          <p>A museum web site requires special techniques to make it a place 
            worth visiting: the site must have interesting and useful information 
            and be organised so that public access is simple and enjoyable.</p>
          <p>Net surfers represent a new type of museum visitor that could become, 
            sooner or later, a real visitor. The success of this attraction relies 
            on the quality of the presentation and on the contents. Special techniques 
            should be used to make a Web museum a place worth visiting; they include 
            navigation in virtual worlds </FONT><a href="#b22"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>22<a name="i22"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3>, 
            animated audio-visual shows of the museum rooms and collections, traveling 
            through time and through the stories of objects </font><a href="#b23"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>23<a name="i23"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3>.</p>
          <p>Some of these ideas are being currently applied in a prototype site 
            on the </FONT><a href="../http://www.um.geira.pt/mns" target="_top"><font face="Arial" size=3>Museu 
            Nogueira da Silva</font></a><font face="Arial" size=3> </font><a href="#b24"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>24<a name="i24"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3> 
            (MNS). The site structure follows a conventional approach - the museum 
            background, </font><a href="../http://www.um.geira.pt/mns/escola" target="_top"><font face="Arial" size=3> 
            school oriented activities</font></a><font face="Arial" size=3> </font><a href="#b25"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>25<a name="i25"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3>, 
            </font><a href="../http://www.um.geira.pt/mns/col" target="_top"><font face="Arial" size=3>the 
            collections</font></a><font face="Arial" size=3> </font><a href="#b26"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>26<a name="i26"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3>,

            and </font><a href="../http://www.um.geira.pt/mns/gal" target="_top"><font face="Arial" size=3>the 
            art gallery</font></a><font face="Arial" size=3> </font><a href="#b28"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>28<a name="i28"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3> 
            - but it also includes some innovation in the way the site is built, 
            both at the presentation level and at the contents. This section further 
            explores the presentation level, while next section addresses the 
            contents.</p>
          <p>The MNS site interface was designed for three adult user profiles 
            - the "occasional&quot;, the "intentional&quot; and the "expert&quot; 
            user - and a </FONT><a href="../http://www.um.geira.pt/mns/kid" target="_top"><font face="Arial" size=3>"kid" 
            profile</font></a><font face="Arial" size=3> </font><a href="#b29"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>29<a name="i29"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3>. 
            The "occasional" user gets to the museum site purely by chance; he/she 
            uses his/her spare/leisure time to browse on the net; the home page 
            should be attractive and simple enough to persuade someone to stay 
            and to further explore the museum site. The "intentional&quot; user 
            already expects to find a typical structure of a museum site and he/she 
            is curious about the available data on that particular museum. The 
            "expert&quot; user knows exactly what to look for, though they may 
            need some help to find it; the available data on the searched items 
            should be complete and detailed and include graphics, which is the 
            basis for all three user profiles. Kids have a special entrance to 
            the museum: the aim is to learn through playing; this "kid-oriented" 
            pages also play a complementary role to the school visits.</p>
          <p>A consistent interface which integrates the available data on the 
            museum, is crucial to our design. Consider the following as an illustration 
            of current experiments: from within a virtual visit to the rooms of 
            the museum, a visitor can "look around" at the objects on the shelves 
            with a panoramic view, click any relevant object to search and display 
            the available data on the museum digital catalogue, and perform a 
            3D manipulation on the object image to see details. Some object records 
            have links to additional data, including environment settings that 
            are relevant to better define the context of an object. The navigation 
            facilities were designed to provide an intuitive and user friendly 
            interface.</p>
          <p>The major emphasis on innovation at the presentation level is towards 
            the use of concepts that were borrowed from the virtual reality environments: 
            current experiments explore the power of VRML - virtual worlds mixed 
            with real images - and QTVR - navigation in panoramic views or on-screen 
            manipulation of 3D objects.</p>
          <p>Relevant pages that explore these technologies include:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>
            <li>a VRML visit to the current or previous exhibitions at the art 
              gallery of the museum (the technical details are addressed in a 
              Geira companion paper in this conference </FONT><a href="#b30"><sup><font face="Arial" size=3>30<a name="i30"></a></sup></FONT></a><font face="Arial" size=3>);</li></P> 
            <p>
            <li>a VRML trip to a virtual "built your own exhibition" art gallery, 
              that shows art objects designed and/or displayed by Web visitors, 
              using a tool provided by the Web site (the technical details are 
              addressed in the Geira companion paper just referred to);</li></P> 
            <p>
            <li>a guided tour through the museum rooms and gardens, using QTVR 
              technology and voice over. Once in a room, if you click an object, 
              a record with the object description is taken from the data base 
              and the data is displayed on the screen; when required, additional 
              information may be added, such as background music, 3D interactive 
              view of the object, or finer detail of the image.</li></P>
          </ul></FONT>
          <h4>Case study: school visits</h4>
          <font face="Arial" size=3>
          <p>For children, visiting the museum is an important opportunity to 
            establish a relationship with their cultural heritage through a story, 
            a reference, or an idea, which allows them to built fantasies and 
            creative scenarios about the past. To establish this contact through 
            a single object a time, in an interdisciplinary, concrete, playful 
            and sensitive way, is what makes this a significant experience - - 
            &quot;<i>Les enfants, font preuve d'une intense spontaneit&eacute;, 
            d'une exceptionnelle receptivit&eacute;. Plut&ocirc;t que de leur 
            imposer le mod&egrave;le culturel des responsable mus&eacute;aux ou 
            de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; dominante, on donnera carri&egrave;re 
            &agrave; leur esprit critique, &agrave; leurs capacit&eacute;s d'observation, 
            &agrave; leur sensibilit&eacute;.</i>&quot;, Georges Henri Rivi&egrave;re, 
            1989.</p>
          <p>Guided by this philosophy, different institutions concerned with 
            culture and education - Museum, School and Community - cooperated 
            to mount the project "Look, listen and feel a museum", which has four 
            main goals:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>
            <li>to destroy barriers in the relationship between children and the 
              museum by creating a relaxed, creative and entertaining environment;</li></P> 
            <p>
            <li>to fully feel - to look, to listen and, whenever possible, to 
              touch, to taste and to smell - the objects and the ambience of the 
              museum;</li></P>
            <p>
            <li>to create behaviours, values and evaluation criteria - through 
              the established communication with the objects - and to stimulate 
              answers using different means of self-expression: plastic, musical, 
              spoken, written and movement;</li></P>
            <p>
            <li>to gather information, vocabulary, principles and generic concepts.</li></P>
          </ul>
          <p>After a first visit to the museum - to introduce the children to 
            the museum location, history and to a particular object - the children 
            return to the museum (more than once) to feel that particular object 
            in different ways. All the visits end with a plastic activity.</p>
          <p>Based on a example of a painting from the XVII century - representing 
            the Port of Naples - these are some of the activities developed by 
            the children :</p>
          <ul>
            <p>
            <li>see the museum - observe and talk about the painting: shapes, 
              colour, light, hour of the day and theme. If there is not enough 
              data on a topic, engage the childrens creativity to invent stories 
              related to the painting (destiny of those boats?...). Once back 
              in school they can go deeper into curricular subjects (the volcano, 
              the gulf, Pompeii, the ships, the sea, ...). In the end the children 
              are given room to paint what they saw.</li></P>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <p>
            <li>hear the museum - the 2nd visit is dedicated to the sound; classic 
              music will be heard to dramatize the painting and contrast the violence 
              of the volcano's eruption and the calm of inactivity. The children 
              "listen" to the painting, the invented story, the trip, the feelings 
              of who stays and who leaves, the storm, the silence and the calm. 
              The visit ends with a new plastic activity (cut, bend &amp; paste, 
              ...);</li></P>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <p>
            <li>feel the museum - during this visit to the museum (the last one 
              in this project) all the activities are synthesised with a play 
              that will use the invented story, the texts the children have produced 
              and the music they listened to. </li></P>
          </ul>
          <p>This project is being adapted to the Web during 1997/98, using the 
            following methodology:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>
            <li>the set of preparatory documents are no longer distributed on 
              paper but on the Web; the documentation includes some puzzles for 
              the children to draw/paint on printouts, some questions related 
              to objects on the museum that they have to identify/answer during 
              their visit and some other educational games to keep their interested 
              attention once inside the museum;</li></P>
            <p>
            <li>during the visits, some video shots are taken with interviews 
              or just watching and listening to their comments. These clips are 
              later inserted on the Web, so that children can enjoy watching themselves 
              on the Web back at home or school;</li></P>
            <p>
            <li>after the visits the drawings/paintings/sculptures the children 
              produced -and related to their visit to the museum - are inserted 
              in the museum virtual gallery, as a team activity for themselves 
              and their teacher.</li></P>
          </ul>
          </font> 
          <h4>Conclusions</h4>
          <font face="Arial" size=3>
          <p>Museum curators are struggling to increase the number of visitors 
            to their museum. They ought to address not only specific publics that 
            already go to a museum, but also the most recent kind of museum visitors, 
            those with no face: the virtual and remote visitors, also known as 
            the (Inter)net surfers.</p>
          <p>Net surfers have high technological expectations: they want virtual 
            visits and presentations, 3D object manipulation, more interaction, 
            animation.... This suggests a new approach to the museums collections 
            that will benefit all kinds of public. And curators should not be 
            afraid of emptying their museums with the use of the Web; instead 
            they should consider the Web as another important way to publicise 
            the museum and diversify the audiences. </p>
          <p>Current experimental work on a museum site - Museu Nogueira da Silva 
            - shows that there is plenty of room for creativity to take advantage 
            of this new media to give life to museums. The museum site has a conventional 
            structure, but it includes references to temporary exhibitions - 3D 
            virtualisation of real ones, virtual-only exhibitions - animated guided 
            tours - through a theme, through space, through the time - and educational 
            outreaches - school teacher's guides according to the age levels, 
            pre- and post-quizzes, video clips on the Web showing the children 
            reactions during the previous visit.</p>
          <p>It is still too early to evaluate the results of this prototype, 
            since this paper describes an on-going implementation of a multi-disciplinary 
            project. More time is required to complete the object cataloguing 
            and the consequent integration stages, to prepare the virtual tours 
            of the remaining spaces, to include more stories about the objects, 
            and to assess the school responses to the museum activities.</p>
          <p>Further technological improvements are planned for the near future. 
            Reference can be made to two particular ones: to use visitor registration 
            and profiling to customise a visit, and employing techniques that 
            simulate a virtual environment to contextualize historical objects.</p>
