          is a project aiming to build a network for information retrieval from 
          databases belonging to Culture and Academia Institutions (Museums, Libraries, 
          Archives, Universities, etc.). Such Institutions are evolving from their 
          traditional roles based on conservation and research towards becoming 
          service providers as well. Services are designed for satisfying two 
          very different user profiles: professional user and lay public user 
          (</font><a href="#Ref3" name="Ref3back"><font size=3>[3]</a></font><font size=2> 
          </font><a href="#Ref6" name="Ref6back"><font size=3>[6]</a></font><font size=2>).<br>
          <br>
          The above mentioned service provision must be carried out as easy as 
          possible, but as efficient as possible as well. These characteristics 
          must be analysed from the viewpoints of remote user coverage, quick 
          access to the information and services themselves, and incomes for the 
          Institution. Compatibility and interoperability among multimedia data 
          (files, documents, etc.), communication networks, and local multimedia 
          information systems are some problems to be tackled in this venture. 
          Nevertheless, local user and Institutional preferences or particularities 
          must be preserved in a wide sense.<br>
          <br>
          There are several projects implementing different sets of services to 
          be deployed in this framework. BABEL is one of them, offering services 
          of database teleconsult for both professional and lay public users. 
          Other projects offer telesearch for the preparation of exhibitions, 
          real time information exchange among experts, or even a teleducation 
          environment with professional training for enterprises.<br>
          <br>
          BABEL is the acronym of &quot;Multimedia Services for Museums and Libraries 
          via Internet&quot;. The acronym makes reference to the resolution of 
          the heterogeneous database teleconsult through a common system, from 
          a unique session, and with a unique user's manual. The project is built 
          on the Internet, and Museums and Libraries are the Institutions actually 
          involved. This is not a limitation for other Institutions to become 
          associate members to the BABEL consortium, either as information providers, 
          or as users, or as both. In fact, contacting to associate members is 
          one of the most important tasks in BABEL.<br>

          a testbed for testing purposes by providing network access segments 
          to the Internet for the different Institutions and external users. The 
          support of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture ensures the 
          call for new Institutions as associate members, as well as the future 
          of this initiative once finalised the BABEL project.</font><font size=3><b><i>

          1.3.1 The BABEL idea and its general objectives</font><br>
          <br></b><font size=2>
          BABEL is a project aiming to make an experience on a teleconsult service 
          of databases belonging to Museums and Libraries. The multimedia archives 
          involved have heterogeneous data structuration, because every Institution 
          has created independently its different object registration cards. The 
          BABEL access system has the following characteristics: 
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Reuse of all existing databases belonging to Museums and Libraries, 
                as well as respectfulness with their internal heterogeneities 
                regarding data formats. A curator cannot be said that any catalog 
                personalization must be forgotten: the structure of the objects 
                registration cards may be the result of a Doctoral Thesis carried 
                out during several years of hard work. 
              <li>Unique user's manual, compatible being with that of the </font><a href="#Ret2" name="Ret2back"><font size=3>RAMA</a></font><font size=2> 
                project for Europe. The RAMA project was destinated to the professional 
                user, and the application used for the professional user in BABEL 
                is called </font><a href="#Ret3" name="Ret3back"><font size=3>MIRA</a></font><font size=2>
              . MIRA offers a powerful interface and services for composing very 
              complex queries in a session opened simultaneously against a number 
              of database servers located in the Internet. 
              <li>Database accessibility from de facto standard WWW navigators, 
                usually for lay public users. 
              <li>Unique login/password in the whole network (Internet) to be 
                used in a common session opened against all the desired databases 
                belonging to Museums and Libraries. Nevertheless, the same user 
                may have different profiles in every database; therefore the access 
                permissions regarding different data types or archive fields can 
                be restricted to the same user in different way by different Institutions 
                within the same session. For instance, the director of a Museum 
                may be a simple external user in other Museum, while consulting 
                both databases from the same session, using the same login/password. 
            </ul>
          </ul>
          The name of BABEL has been chosen on the basis of the aforementioned 
          heterogeneities, accessing heterogeneous data structure from the same 
          system. BABEL faces an existing reality: all the heterogeneities are 
          unified in a common system that respects the diversity SW, HW, and communication 
          platforms belonging to every Institution, as well as their specific 
          data structures (object registration cards). This is the existing reality, 
          mainly in the Museum field: all those heterogeneities cannot be avoided. 
          There are a lot of efforts to achieve a normalization regarding Museum 
          databases, but the actual reality is the heterogeneity. In order to 
          provide services based on Museum databases, it is not possible to wait 
          for the results of those normalization efforts. On the other hand, regardless 
          of a full normalization scenario that could be achieved in the forthcoming 
          years, the systems providing services must be open for personalization 
          of archives belonging to every Institution at very local levels. This 
          open door for the personalization is a sample of the respect that the 
          database engineer must keep regarding the Humanities expert, who is 
          the user of the applications that he designs and develops.<br>
          <br>
          The Libraries world is more normalized than the Museums one. Hence, 
          the internal data structuration have less alternatives. Nonetheless, 
          there is not a unique format but preferences for some of them. This 
          is the reason why the BABEL fundamentals have still a place within the 
          Libraries applications for services provision.<br>
          <br>
          Another general objective of BABEL is to capitalize the investments 
          made by European projects, financed by several Consortia, the European 
          Commission, and in the case of Spanish partners, also by the Comisión 
          Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnolog&iacute;a of the Spanish Government. 
          Specifically, the most relevant investments have been made within the </font>
          <a href="#Ret4" name="Ret4back"><font size=3>RACE</a></font><font size=2> 
          Programme: RACE 1078 EMN Project (European Museums Network) </font><a href="#Ref7" name="Ref7back"><font size=3>[7]</a></font><font size=2> 
          and RACE 2043 RAMA (Remote Access to Museum Archives) </font><a href="#Ref2" name="Ref2back"><font size=3>[2]</a></font><font size=2>, 
          both of them with very strong Spanish participation. The capitalization 
          of their results in Spain consists of the projection and expansion of 
          the fundamentals of those projects, mainly the RAMA Project. The Spanish 
          investment in RAMA was 4.5 million ECU out of a total investment in 
          Europe of 18 million ECU. The capitalization of the RAMA results in 
          the different member states of the European Union was a commitment of 
          the RAMA partners in front of the European Commission. The way in which 
          the results projection in Spain has been carried out is described in 
          section 1.3.2.<br>
          <br>
          <b><a name="_Ref402535388"></a>1.3.2 Particular objectives<br>
          <br>
          </b>The first particular objective within the projection of the RAMA 
          project into the Spanish reality was the creation of the Museums and 
          Libraries network in Spain. Such initiative has been made with the support 
          of the Institutions and enterprises that ensure the success of this 
          venture: Telefónica of Spain (ensuring the existence of access segments 
          to Internet), and the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture (ensuring 
          the postproject maintenance of the BABEL fundamentals). The Spanish 
          Museums and Libraries network will allow the remote database consult 
          from any point of a public network, by means of a rerouting to Internet.<br>
          <br>
          The next particular objective consists of the development of the necessary 
          gateways between the common system with unique manual of BABEL and the 
          databases of the Museums and Libraries participants in the BABEL consortium. 
          It must not be forgotten that those databases have heterogeneous data 
          structuration, as a result of the personalization carried out by every 
          Institution, mainly the Museums. Furthermore, gateways must be also 
          developed for the Institutions joining BABEL as associate members (status 
          described in sections 1.1 and 1.2) for them to be able to join the BABEL 
          network in Internet.<br>
          <br>
          Regardless of the above, the projection of the RAMA results in Spain 
          must be carried out taking into account the particularities of the Spanish 
          environment. The purpose of the European Commission in any initiative 
          financed in the past within the RACE Programme (RAMA, EMN), or actually 
          founded within the </font><a href="#Ret5" name="Ret5back"><font size=3>ACTS</a></font><font size=2> 
          (SICMA Project) and </font><a href="#Ret6" name="Ret6back"><font size=3>ESPRIT</a></font><font size=2> 
          (MENHIR Project) Programmes is to make feasibility prototypes supported 
          by experiences based on advanced network technologies. The purpose of 
          BABEL, financed in a Spanish Programme made as the mirror of the &quot;Telematics 
          Application Programme&quot; of the European Commission is very different. 
          The idea is to concentrate on expanding a real network providing services 
          for/from Museums and Libraries, using the existing technological resources 
          (mainly dealing with public network access); such resources must have 
          a reasonable cost in order to ensure that the number of Museums and 
          Libraries (as well as remote users of the services provided by them) 
          involved even as associate members is the largest possible. Hence BABEL 
          has not got advanced network experiences as a requirement, which would 
          mean a selection, and therefore a constraint, with respect to the Museums 
          and Libraries to join BABEL. This happened in RAMA (just when the Internet 
          was being born), and actually happens in SICMA, where ATM connectivity 
          among Museums is sine qua non condition.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, the Spanish reality arises a number of specific lacks. 
          BABEL is paving the ground for the resolution of those lacks, by means 
          of pointing them as minimal requirements for Museums and Libraries to 
          join the BABEL network. Those lacks can be summarized as either the 
          non existence of digitalized multimedia archives, or the poor data population 
          of those archives in case of existing, or (mainly) the non existence 
          of access segments to public networks to be rerouted to the Internet. 
          This last lack is very important, since the most of the Museums and 
          Libraries have the normal telephone connection at most. The role of 
          BABEL is to act as engine to remove the lacks: this is another reason 
          why the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture is a sponsor of BABEL.<br>
          <br>
          Another particular objective of BABEL is the creation of a Virtual Museum 
          and a Virtual Library in Spain, to act as common information point (</font><a href="#Ret7" name="Ret7back"><font size=3>PIC</a></font><font size=2>) 
          in the Internet. A PIC provides mainly a directory service, and will 
          consist of a database server populated with descriptors of the data 
          contained in the database servers belonging to the different Museums 
          and Libraries (BABEL members and associate members). The navigation 
          within this PIC requires a minimal commitment regarding some database 
          fields, therefore being the last but not the least goal of the project. 
          This unification does not break the heterogeneity and personalization 
          of Museums and Libraries archives, because the descriptors will contain 
          a very reduced number of fields, while their local databases can keep 
          local heterogeneities in any data structure. This is another reason 
          for the participation of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture 
          as a sponsor of the project to host any initiative on normalization 
          although involving minimal commitments and consensus. Hence, although 
          BABEL fundamentals are the respect to the heterogeneities to provide 
          services within a common system, it is also a platform for showing the 
          usefulness of a normalization regarding data structure by demonstrating 
          that the provisions of services is more powerful in a normalized environment. 
          The PIC can also reroute the communication to the desired Museums or 
          Libraries within the same session, although this is actually an open 
          issue. Furthermore, its physical implementation is to be decided if 
          distributed (server networks appearing as a unique virtual server in 
          the Internet) or concentrated (only one server in the Spanish network).<br>
          <br>
          By means of the above objectives, BABEL is pioneering in Spain within 
          the field of the new role that the Cultural and Academia Institutions 
          are called to develop: the use of knowledge coming from their traditional 
          research to provide services to other Institutions or even to professional 
          and lay public users. Furthermore, the use of the Internet as the basic 
          network does not restrict the BABEL network to Spain. Any Museum or 
          Library can join BABEL as associate member, never mind its location 
          throughout the world.</font><font size=4><b> </td>

          2 Technological Bases<br></font>
          <font size=3><i> <br>
          2.1 Products and Required Developments<br>
          <br>
          </font></b></i><font size=2>The Comisión Interministerial de Ciencia 
          y Tecnolog&iacute;a of the Spanish Government (CICYT) emphasized that 
          BABEL should focus on the following issues: 
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Any action directed towards the implementation of network experiences 
                is the most important one. 
              <li>Any development that is not explicitly directed towards network 
                experiences must be reduced or even removed. 
            </ul>
          </ul>
          In the light of the above, it has been decided to install several products 
          already developed in other projects. Changes in the user interface of 
          such products have been discarded, and only gateways to new databases 
          will be developed. These decisions are translated into the reality as 
          follows: 
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>To install the MIRA product for the professional user. As evolved 
                from RAMA, MIRA's manual is compatible with that of the RAMA project 
                for use in Europe. MIRA technology has been developed by the authors </font>
                <a href="#Ref5" name="Ref5back"><font size=3>[5]</a></font><font size=2> 
                . The MIRA client can be downloaded by free from the </font><a href="../http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/~babel" target="_top"><font size=3>BABEL 
                WWW site</a> </font><font size=2>
              . It requires the development of the gateways to the databases at 
              the server sites. 
              <li>To make it possible the access from a conventional WWW navigator 
                to the same databases as from MIRA. This access type is mainly 
                destinated to the lay public user. The gateway technology to the 
                database servers has also been developed by the authors </font><a href="#Ref4" name="Ref4back"><font size=3>[4]</a></font><font size=2> 
              . It also requires the development of the gateways to the databases 
              at the server sites. 
              <li>To develop and install WWW pages for the BABEL members and associate 
                members from contents given by the corresponding Museums and Libraries. 
              <li>To develop the Virtual Museum and the Virtual Library (PIC) 
                and to start its service provision. 
            </ul>
          </ul>
          The developments and installations require a series of actions to be 
          carried out directly by the Museums and Libraries involved. These actions 
          are as follows: 
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Massive population of the databases in case of existence (all 
                the BABEL members have got it) or acquisition of a database management 
                system previously to make the database population (for associate 
                members, if they have not got it). 
              <li>Acquisition management and installation of commercial HW, SW, 
                and communication platforms. 
              <li>Installation management of public WAN access segments to the 
                Internet. 
              <li>Management of the database contents during service provision 
                through the network. 
              <li>Agreement about the specifications and common fields to navigate 
                through the Virtual Museum and the Virtual Library (PIC). 
              <li>Aspects of intellectual property rights. 
              <li>Assessment from the viewpoint of the users. 
            </ul>
          </ul>
          All the above actions must be complemented with the search for associate 
          members.</font><font size=3><b><i>

          <br>
          </font></b></i><font size=2>BABEL project title is &quot;Multimedia 
          Services for Museums and Libraries via Internet&quot;. Therefore, the 
          Internet is the public network supporting BABEL. All the participants, 
          either BABEL members or associate members must have access to the Internet, 
          regardless of how the access segments to this network are provided by 
          the public network operator. A general scheme is shown in Figure 1. 
          The Museums and Libraries which are BABEL members appear in the bottom 
          part of Figure 1. They are both information providers (servers) and 
          users (clients). The top part of the same Figure 1 shows the associate 
          members participation, which can be carried out either as users (clients) 
          exclusively, or as information providers (servers) and users (clients) 
          simultaneously.

          <br></font>
          <font size=2>The BABEL architecture is based on the client server paradigm. 
          The client configuration is a low cost one, PC based, and the server 
          is a UNIX machine. Details of these configurations (including options) 
          are shown in </font><a href="../http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/~babel" target="_top"><font size=3>http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/~babel</a></font><font size=2>. 
          Actually, BABEL servers have been compiled and are working in several 
          UNIX platforms, such as HP, SUN, SGI, and IBM. The database management 
          system (DBMS) can belong to any manufacturer: the gateway to be developed 
          has different degree of difficulty depending on the manufacturer and 
          mainly on the internal data structure of every Museum or Library. The 
          recommended option is to have DBMSs with a precompiler supporting embedded-SQL 
          sentences (as native language of the relational databases) directly 
          into the BABEL server application. In case of database management systems 
          are resident in other machines where UNIX is not the operative system, 
          there must be another gateway between the UNIX machine where the BABEL 
          server application is resident, and the machine where the DBMS is resident. 
          This second gateway must be provided by products made by the DBMS manufacturer. 
          This is the case of some of the BABEL members, where e.g. the DBMS is 
          resident in a machine under SCO. Actually, the BABEL server is stabilized 
          with two DBMSs: ORACLE and INFORMIX.</font><font size=4><b>

          3 CDs and Alternatives for Service Provision<br>
          <br>
          </font></b><font size=2>During several years, the multimedia applications 
          have been associated to CDs, because this was the only technology able 
          to combine random access, large storage capacity, and low cost for large 
          scale distribution. While other initiatives in this direction were undertaken 
          in the past or continued (CD-I), and the number of CD-ROMs to be edited 
          is expected to increase, large amounts of money have been also invested 
          in services based on telecommunications. These services reflect the 
          common strategy followed by the most of the enterprises involved in 
          the multimedia market: the common goal is to provide a transactional 
          value added, and not only to provide information on electronic supports. 
          This involves the use of databases in realtime.<br>
          <br>
          Additionally, the sell of a service gives greater benefits because the 
          marginal costs to add new services based on the same information contents 
          are less than the investments required to create a new product. For 
          instance, the cost of updating and adding new items to a database is 
          completely marginal compared with the production cost of a new CD-ROM. 
          This cost is precisely the starting point where a service provided with 
          databases in realtime makes sense with respect to the production and 
          sell of a CD-ROM, even more when the information contents are changing 
          or very frequently updated. On the other hand, this point is more evident 
          for services involving remote and distributed databases (belonging to 
          different Institutions) in realtime, which can be considered as &quot;electronic 
          libraries&quot; with respect to the CD-ROMs, which can be considered 
          as &quot;electronic books&quot;.<br>
          <br>
          The explosion expected in the multimedia communication services market 
          has created the obvious necessity of the existence of contents to be 
          transferred. Actually, several service providers have invested large 
          amounts of money to achieve licences and rights on multimedia informations 
          coming from different owners. This race to achieve licences and rights 
          brings a description of the actual map as &quot;information provider 
          paradise&quot;: in the risky market of the multimedia technologies the 
          information providers have the most privileged position because they 
          can license their information contents.<br>
          <br>
          There are two ways to implement &quot;Culture services provision&quot; 
          as contribution to those &quot;electronic libraries&quot; in a telecommunication 
          network by the Culture and Academia Institutions: 
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Information (or content) providers: this is indirect service 
                provision. It is carried out by means of exploitation licenses 
                of their information contents to an intermediate entity who will 
                be the service provider. The contracts must reflect clearly the 
                limits and the way in which the property rights of the informations 
                licensed are to be handled by the service provider. 
              <li>Service providers: this is direct service provision. The Culture 
                and Academia Institutions directly assume the role of service 
                providers to exploit directly the services based on their information 
                contents. There is no contract with any intermediate service provider, 
                but the Institutions must have knowledge and experience on strategies 
                of service provider operators. 
            </ul>
          </ul>
          Whichever is the formula adopted for the service provision (direct or 
          indirect), there is the need of emphasizing that given the coverage 
          of the service (may be international, as this the case of Internet), 
          there may be different laws about the intellectual property rights in 
          different countries. As a consequence, there may be different limits 
          about what the final user can do with the information contents. Particularly, 
          this issue is to be taken into account within the contract with the 
          service provider in the case of indirect provision.</font><font size=4><b>

          5 Conclusions<br>
          <br>
          </font></b><font size=2>BABEL is a project aiming to create a network 
          of Museums and Libraries in Spain, compatible being with the European 
          initiatives, to make it possible a teleconsult of their databases either 
          from the Internet or from any public network point with access segment 
          to the Internet. The teleconsult system must be based on a common manual, 
          but respecting heterogeneities, particularities, and personalizations 
          of the object registration cards resident being in the different Museums 
          and Libraries (may be also at the level of different Departments of 
          every Museum or Library). BABEL is a capitalization of results coming 
          from projects sponsored by the European Commission, and the idea is 
          to extend a network as much as possible by means of incorporating associate 
          members to BABEL. These associate members may be information providers 
          and users simultaneously, or only users.<br>
          <br>
          Another objective is the creation of a common information point to enter 
          the Culture Spanish network (PIC) called Virtual Museum and Virtual 
          Library. The user can navigate through descriptors resident being in 
          this PIC, and then decide which databases are to be consulted. Normalization 
          of a few fields must be agreed to make it possible the navigation in 
          this PIC, but the personalization of the registration cards is kept 
          in the different databases belonging to the Museums and Libraries.<br>
          <br>
          Actually the project is being carried out within the foreseen framework 
          to achieve both its general and particular goals. The technological 
          achievements and the dissemination of results have been balanced. The 
          commitment of important sponsors is crucial for the success of the project 
          and for the postproject continuation of the BABEL fundamentals.<br>
          <br>
          BABEL is in line with the preparation of Museums and Libraries for its 
          new role of service providers, converging with initiatives such as the 
          Memorandum of Understanding launched by the European Commission.<br>
