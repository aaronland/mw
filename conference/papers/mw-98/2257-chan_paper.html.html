            <p><b>Introduction </b></p>
            <p>The <a target="_top" href="../http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/multi_history/ggp.html">Global 
              Gathering Place: The History of Canada's Ethnic Diversity (GGP)</a> 
              is a joint initiative between the <a target="_top" href="../http://www.utoronto.ca/mhso/">Multicultural 
              History Society of Ontario (MHSO)</a> and the <a target="_top" href="../http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/">Centre 
              for Instructional Technology Development (CITD)</a> at the University 
              of Toronto at Scarborough. A key partner of the project is eight 
              schools from the Scarborough Board of Education in Toronto.</p>
            <p>The project is founded on the recognition that in a multicultural 
              country such as Canada it is imperative that we recognize the contributions 
              of the diverse peoples who have joined in the making of our nation. 
              Our sense of Canadian identity and our concept of nationalism comes 
              from our shared histories. Given this imperative, cultural institutions 
              need to be more proactive in stimulating public interest in Canada's 
              unique multicultural history. The GGP is an example of this proactive 
              approach.</p>
            <p>Through the World-Wide Web, the project makes available to a wide 
              range of users valuable and rich resources housed at the MHSO. This 
              information would otherwise not be accessible because of geographic 
              barriers, cost, and the limits of the print medium.</p>
            <p>This article describes the key goals of the GGP, the phases of 
              development of the project, the roles and contributions of the various 
              partners, the challenges and preliminary outcomes of implementing 
              the project in the classroom, and plans for the future.</p>
            <p><b>Target Audience and Goals of the Project</b></p>
            <p>The Global Gathering Place is an electronic educational outreach 
              program that primarily targets history and social studies students 
              from Grade 7 to 12. Although the primary focus of the project is 
              the history of the diverse groups that make up Canada, the broad 
              range of subjects covered in the project (e.g. immigration, religion, 
              arts, literature) make it suitable for cross-disciplinary use and 
              for fulfilling a range of curriculum goals, such as the teaching 
              of social responsibility, critical thinking, writing skills, and 
              research methods.</p>
            <p>The GGP's approach relies heavily on educational resources developed 
              by the senior education officer of the MHSO, Dr. Lillian Petroff, 
              whose work is based on &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; research findings 
              in immigration and ethnic studies. The material on the site is therefore, 
              of interest to various community members, cultural agencies, and 
              researchers interested in immigration and refugee studies, diversity 
              issues and multicultural education.</p>
            <p>The major goals of the Global Gathering Place are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to provide national and international access to valuable historical 
                resources housed at the Multicultural History Society of Ontario; 
              <li>to increase student awareness of the rich social and cultural 
                history of the diverse ethnocultural groups that make up Canada. 
              <li>to foster a classroom environment in which local, family, ethnic 
                and immigration history can come together as Canadian History, 
                through a series of classroom projects, guided by a set of questions 
                that challenge students to reflect upon their own experience. 
              <li>to encourage students to develop critical thinking and information 
                literacy skills as well as alternative means of expression through 
                the use of information technology. 
              <li>to explore and develop a new paradigm for delivery of heritage 
                outreach program to schools and the community. 
            </ul>
            <p><b>The Partners</b></p>
            <p>The MHSO was founded in 1976 to foster the positive aspects of 
              living in a multilingual, polyethnic province. Its mission is to 
              bring to a wide public audience the history of the diversity of 
              Ontario's people. Located on Queen's Park Crescent East, the Society 
              houses an extensive archival record of Canada's peoples, manuscript 
              collections, and ethnic newspapers. The MHSO's library holds more 
              than 8,000 hours of oral history, with interviews in more than fifty 
              languages drawn from the experiences of groups as diverse as the 
              Polish War Veterans, immigrants from the United Kingdom, and the 
              Vietnamese Boat People.</p>
            <p>The society has also produced a number of well-known traveling 
              exhibits that collectively tell the stories of the diverse people 
              who settled in Canada. These exhibits include &quot;Many Rivers 
              to Cross: the African-Canadian Experience&quot;, &quot;History of 
              Chinese Women in Canada&quot;, and &quot;Images of Japanese Canadians&quot;, 
              currently on display at the Heritage Gallery of Canada's People 
              at the Royal Ontario Museum.</p>
            <p>In addition to its impressive repository of primary and secondary 
              sources, the MHSO has active programs in publishing, education and 
              community outreach. However, the traditional methods of outreach 
              such as traveling exhibits and printed material reach only a limited 
              audience and are very costly to produce and maintain. Like many 
              cultural institutions in Canada in recent years, the MHSO has seen 
              severe budget cuts and increasing competition for limited funding. 
              The Global Gathering Place represents an experiment in broadening 
              the society's funding base and an attempt to extend its educational 
              outreach programs to a much wider group of people through the use 
              of information technology.</p>
            <p>The partnership between the MHSO and the CITD began in the summer 
              of 1996. Founded in 1993, the CITD is a facility created by William 
              Barek to support and assist faculty at the University of Toronto 
              at Scarborough in the development of multimedia courseware and online 
              learning resources. Over the last few years, the CITD has created, 
              or assisted in, the development of Web sites for over fourty courses 
              across a broad range of subject areas. The CITD has produced and 
              published a number of major CD-ROM projects in the Humanities and 
              Life Sciences. Besides product development, the CITD also conducts 
              workshops on instructional design and Web-based and other forms 
              of electronic publishing.</p>
            <p>In early 1997, the University of Toronto became a partner in a 
              multi-partner project known as <a target="_top" href="../http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/Ednet/index.html">EdNet2</a>, 
              and the CITD was invited to participate. Shaw Cable and Silicon 
              Graphics Canada are the major industry partners in the project, 
              providing, respectively, access to high speed fibre-optic connection 
              and the powerful O2 computers. The former Scarborough Board of Education, 
              now part of the Toronto District School Board, is providing one 
              primary school and seven secondary schools as test sites for the 
              EdNet2 project. These selected schools are wired and equipped with 
              high-end equipment designed for networked learning.</p>
            <p>Briefly stated, the primary goal of EdNet2 is to help the school 
              board learn more about networked computing and about how it can 
              be applied to students' learning. These observations will have implications 
              for teacher training, pedagogy, and the transformation of existing 
              curricula to suit learning in a networked environment. The lessons 
              learned from projects conducted in these schools will be the basis 
              for future decision-making about the implementation of information 
              technology in other schools.</p>
            <p>The partnership between the MHSO, as a rich repository of Canadian 
              multicultural heritage, and the CITD, as an organization with a 
              reputation for the development of multimedia knowledge products, 
              is a natural one. The involvement of CITD with the EdNet2 project 
              also proves to be ideal, as the latter supplies schools ready to 
              be partners providing field sites for the testing and evaluation 
              of the GGP. More important, the EdNet2 partnership allows us to 
              pose several important questions related to the use of the Web in 
              the classroom.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do students show greater spontaneous interest in a learning 
                activity that uses a new technology than in one employing the 
                traditional approaches? More specifically, will students become 
                more interested in heritage knowledge because of the new medium? 
              <li>Do Web-based resources enable students to learn in new ways? 
                If so, how can we design learning activities that take advantage 
                of these new ways of learning? 
              <li>Will the use of the Web stimulate higher order learning skills, 
                such as critical analysis, creative thinking, and problem-solving? 
              <li>How will the information and activities in the GGP project enhance 
                existing curricula? 
            </ul>
            <p><b>Phases and Structure of the Project </b></p>
            <p>As a multi-year initiative, the project encompasses a number of 
              component projects, which are being carried out in three distinct, 
              though overlapping, phases.</p>
            <p><b>1) Phase I</b></p>
            <p>This phase involves:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>defining the target audience 
              <li>identifying the goals of the project 
              <li>defining the scope and content of the project 
              <li>exploring external partnerships 
              <li>strengthening community liaison, and 
              <li>constructing the framework of the Web site. 
            </ul>
            <p>While our goal is to provide representation of as many ethnic groups 
              as possible, it is painfully obvious that such a goal is impossible 
              to achieve, at least in the short term. The question of which groups 
              should be represented first is, indeed, difficult, and one likely 
              to engender much debate. After careful examination of the MHSO's 
              holding, five groups were chosen as prototypes for developing the 
              project: the <a target="_top" href="../http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/multi_history/Chinese/Chinese_TOC.html">Chinese</a>, 
              Sikh, Chilean, Jamaican and <a target="_top" href="../http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/multi_history/Italian/Ital_overview.html">Italian</a>. 
              The choice of these particular groups was influenced by the availability 
              of material ready to be transferred online, as well as on the community 
              relationships that had already been established. Another important 
              factor in the decision was that authenticated and useful educational 
              material on these groups is currently not available, or is poorly 
              represented on the Net.</p>
            <p>Using the same criteria, we have identified a second set of groups 
              for subsequent development: the Vietnamese, Irish, Dutch, Blacks, 
              Portuguese, Japanese, Jewish, Korean, Mennonite, Scottish, and Ukrainian.</p>
            <p><b>Structure </b></p>
            <p>Each group's history is presented in a module, consisting of a 
              montage of many images and words, video and sound clips, ideas and 
              opinions from the popular press and scholarly sources, as well as 
              links to exercises, projects and classroom resources. Each module 
              has of a table of contents linked to recurrent social themes:</p>
            <p>* An Overview of the Group <br>
              * Early Settlement <br>
              * Work and Enterprise <br>
              * Immigrant Life: <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ religion and politics, <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ culture and family life, <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ change and persistence <br>
              * Immigrant Encounters with one another and the Canadian Host society 
              <br>
              * Contemporary life</p>
            <p>In addition to the more traditional historical narrative, each 
              module contains links to life histories of ordinary Canadians of 
              various ethnic backgrounds who have lived extraordinary lives. As 
              students travel through time with these individuals, they learn 
              about the ever changing social and political fabrics of our society 
              through the eyes of these individuals. These life histories are 
              meant to stimulate students' interest in their own heritage, and 
              to encourage them to validate their own experience through storytelling.</p>
            <p>We also encourage students to contribute their heritage stories 
              to the GGP and this growing repository will be an invaluable resource 
              for future generations.</p>
            <p><b>2) Phase II</b></p>
            <p>The second phase addresses business, organizational, and design 
              issues, including:</p>
            <ul>

            <p>The project started with a very small seed fund from the CITD, 
              that also donated staff time and supplied the server space for the 
              site. Work on the project has, thus far, been carried out by Drs. 
              Lillian Petroff and Nick Harney, and by Dora Nipp and Carl Thorpe 
              of the MHSO, who donated their own time to the project. We are currently 
              preparing a detailed proposal and budget to be submitted to key 
              granting agencies.</p>
            <p>As the <a target="_top" href="../http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/multi_history/Navigation.html">site 
              map of the GGP</a> clearly indicates, the project is not simply 
              about making an electronic multicultural history archive, but more 
              about creating a lively and growing resource for the study and celebration 
              of multiculturalism that is relevant to teachers and students. To 
              this end, we invited teachers, community members, and equity educators 
              to join an advisory board. By involving the learning community, 
              teachers, and community members in the design of the project, we 
              hope to identify a set of shared goals and reach a better understanding 
              of one another's needs. Our advisors remind us of the need to recognize 
              the diversity of the learning needs of students, reflecting their 
              origins, ethnic background, language, talents, social conditions, 
              and future aspirations.</p>
            <p><b>Design Issues</b></p>
            <p>In designing the site, we want to take advantage of the participatory 
              nature of the Web. We also want to design projects that encourage 
              students to think critically about ideas and opinions that they 
              encounter in print, or in other media, including the Web.</p>
            <p>With this in mind, we designed exercises that encourage students 
              to &quot;rethink&quot; the concepts involving history and people 
              that they generally take for granted, and to &quot;replay&quot; 
              them creatively. Incorporating the resources on the GGP, the &quot;rethinking&quot; 
              exercises are designed to help students think critically about what 
              they have already learned, or what they already know about their 
              own and other cultures. Each rethinking exercise focuses on a few 
              images and a few inquiry questions that encourage students to look 
              at cultural history in a critical and thoughtful way.</p>
            <p>To further reinforce the &quot;rethinking&quot; exercises, we also 
              provide a set of &quot;replaying&quot; exercises that give students 
              an opportunity to &quot;play&quot; with concepts and ideas through 
              creative activities, group projects, role plays, and multimedia 
              experiments. These projects will not only help students learn, but 
              will also provide opportunities for enjoyable interactions between 
              peers. We hope that teachers will find these exercises useful in 
              the classrooms, and that some teachers will contribute ideas for 
              additional activities. We also hope that the multimedia projects 
              produced by the students will be submitted to us to be archived 
              on the GGP homesite or on the student's own school site. This expanding 
              body of knowledge will enliven the study of cultural history.</p>
            <p>To assist students with their projects, the site also provides 
              resources and instructions on how to keep a history journal, how 
              to write news reports, how to conduct interviews, and how to compose 
              a photographic essay, multimedia presentations, or World Wide Web-based 
              documents. Future links will include an open electronic forum for 
              discussion of multicultural education, and a search engine that 
              will allow for easy access to the growing database.</p>
            <p><b>3) Phase III</b></p>
            <p>The third phase of the project is the implementation of the GGP 
              material in the classroom, and the testing of some key assumptions 
              about learning and the Web. In designing the project, we make two 
              broad assumptions that need to be evaluated:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>a) The interactive and collaborative approach to the learning 
                of cultural history central to this project will foster among 
                students a stronger feeling of membership in the community as 
                well as a stronger sense of participation as a Canadian citizen.</p>
              <p>b) By encouraging students to get involved in historical research 
                and to evaluate existing information critically, the GGP will 
                help students develope both critical thinking and information 
                literacy skills.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In September 1997, we made a call to the EdNet2 schools asking 
              for participation in the GGP project, with the intent of seeing 
              how teachers integrate the material into their curriculum, how students 
              respond to the material, and whether they are interested in submitting 
              their own projects for publishing on the Web. We will gather information 
              on student's participation, and see whether their interests in heritage 
              knowledge increase because of the new medium. The following table 
              summarizes the schools that responded to our call and their specific 
              projects and intended product.</p>

            <p><b>Challenges and Preliminary Findings </b></p>
            <p>Although all eight EdNet2 schools responded favourably to the call, 
              and many teachers considered the project to be highly worthwhile, 
              not all the schools were able to participate in the project. This 
              was due mainly either to the lack of technical support in the schools 
              for teachers, or to the lack of time. While it is still too early 
              to determine the success of the GGP, and there is also not sufficient 
              information to evaluate the degree of student participation and 
              the impact the Web made on their performance, a number of important 
              observations have been made.</p>
            <p>We discovered early on in our association with the EdNet2 schools 
              that despite the heavy investment by the school board and industry 
              partners in hardware and connectivity, there is little corresponding 
              investment in training teachers to use the technology.</p>
            <p>There has been little effort made by the Board in showing teachers 
              how they can integrate the new technology into their curriculum. 
              Many teachers, particularly those in the Arts and Social Sciences, 
              remain uncomfortable with the technology and do not see the need 
              for using the Web. The lack of their own exposure to the Net also 
              means that many teachers have not given much thought as to how they 
              can integrate resources such as the GGP into their regular lessons. 
              This is a serious question that we need to address thoroughly if 
              we hope to have our material adopted in the classroom.</p>
            <p>We also found that many teachers, while suffering from uncertainties 
              caused by deep funding cuts and extensive educational reforms by 
              the Provincial Government, are also suffering from severe techno-stress. 
              As educational structures and learning technologies evolve, teachers 
              are asked to assume new roles and responsibilities. Instead of being 
              dispensers of knowledge, teachers are told that they should become 
              facilitators for students who are clients in the process of discovery 
              in the new learning environment. This, according to one teacher, 
              amounts to telling teachers to become technical support staff. Little 
              wonder that many teachers distrust the technology.</p>
            <p>Indeed, one of the most discussed issues on the EdNet2 bulletin 
              is hardware and network problems, with relatively little discussion 
              among the teachers on curriculum integration and instructional strategies 
              using the new media. This is a clear example of how technology can 
              in fact get in the way of learning. As educators, we must be clear 
              on why we are incorporating technology into the classroom, and we 
              should remain skeptical with technology firms who are interested 
              in promoting their wares in the name of education.</p>
            <p>Technical problems aside, our partnership with the EdNet2 schools, 
              and our work with students -- from the primary schools to university 
              -- tell us that information technology can add values to the learning 
              environment by making learning more relevant and responsive to changes 
              in our knowledge base.</p>
            <p>Our experience with students also tells us that the Web stimulates 
              inquiry because it creates environments that presents content in 
              ways that are more engaging, and involve students more directly 
              than do textbooks and traditional teaching tools. The challenge, 
              of course, lies in designing material that will stimulate student 
              inquiry. This issue is more often than not a pedagogical, rather 
              than a technical one, and when we are designing for the Web, we 
              need to work closely with teachers and educators who understand 
              students' needs.</p>
            <p>In addition, we have learnt from our work that by forming partnerships 
              and links within the formal education community (e.g. other schools) 
              and with institutions, industries, and organizations outside the 
              formal system (e.g. museums and galleries, business, media, community 
              groups), our learning structures and knowledge base are enriched 
              and extended. As networking technologies become increasingly accessible, 
              the walls separating school, work, and community begin to dissolve 
              and their activities mutually reinforce one another. These observations 
              will have implications for how cultural institutions design and 
              implement their outreach programs.</p>
            <p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
            <p>The Global Gathering Place is a project that is more than simply 
              making the MHSO's resources available electronically. It is a site 
              providing real and meaningful resources that will enrich the learning 
              experiences of our students. As the site grows and becomes interlinked 
              with other learning and cultural institutions, it will evolve into 
              a &quot;virtual learning space&quot; where students interested in 
              specific aspects of Canada's multicultural history can find all 
              pertinent information that may originate from diverse, geographically 
              disperse institutions and sources.</p>
            <p>George MacDonald, Executive Director of the Canadian Museum of 
              Civilization, remarked that &quot;the story of Canadian heritage 
              is like a big jigsaw puzzle, lying around in pieces. The museums 
              in this country are each keeper of some of the pieces. Libraries, 
              archives, universities, historic sites - they too hold some of the 
              pieces. By creating digital representations of the various pieces, 
              we get a shot a putting the parts of the puzzle back together and 
              seeing the whole picture.&quot; (Cited in the Ottawa Journal, 11/6/94)</p>
            <p>The alliance between the MHSO and the CITD will provide many key 
              pieces of the globally and historically unique puzzle that is Canadian 
              heritage.</p>
