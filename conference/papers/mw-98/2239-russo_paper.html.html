            <h3>Object Immersion: Database-Driven VRML and Robocam Technology 
              in the Virtual Museum</h3>
            <h4><a href="../../bios/russo.html">Angelina 
              Russo</a>, University of South Australia</h4>
            <p>This paper aims to define an application for a particular vrml 
              technology. It uses the museum and emerging virtual museum as the 
              basis for exploring application of dynamic database driven vrml 
              and RoboCam technology. As a designer with several years experience 
              in a design museum in Australia, my interest in the digitisation 
              of object collections and the subsequent display of this material 
              within virtual environments stems from a desire to explore and translate 
              existing museum roles into the virtual realm. </p>
            <p>While mainstream museums in Australia struggle to establish methodologies 
              for content display on the web, the translation of three dimensional 
              space and object display are only just beginning to be explored.. 
              Curators, education officers, technicians and museum management 
              guide the process of digitising and presenting web material while 
              designers watch on. The metamorphosis from three dimensional display 
              space to two dimensional virtual space is undertaken with little 
              research and development of the potential three dimensional representation 
              of gallery spaces in the virtual museum environment.</p>
            <p>Digital technology and its application within museum management 
              is fundamental to the growth of collections and museum issues peculiar 
              to Australia. If Australian museums do not take on the role of presenting 
              their information on the web we can be sure that our stories and 
              diverse history will not be told. </p>
            <p>At the time of writing, the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, Australia, 
              has just won a national contract to develop AMOL (Australian Museums 
              on Line.), a database which incluse a national directory of museums, 
              browser, resource links and forum. Curators and museum management 
              will, over the next year develop strategies for updating and developing 
              digital delivery within the context of broadening museum accessibility. 
              Whilst it represents an exciting opportunity for display of collections,it 
              remains to be seen whether research and development of the spatial 
              translations and object representation will form part of the project.</p>
            <p>This paper will deal with the specific technology known as dynamic 
              database driven vrml and will attempt to define an appropriate application 
              within the context of presenting and displaying museum object collections 
              on the world wide web. It will explore the interactive nature of 
              the technology and its application within three dimensional representations 
              of museum space.</p>
            <p>The paper will focus on the dichotomy between real and virtual 
              museum space and object representation within that space. In doing 
              so, it will develop a methodology for the application of this technology 
              within virtual museum display.</p>
            <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
            <p>The system of organising and classifying object collections is 
              one of the core activities of museum as a cultural institution. 
              These very same objects are susceptible to heat, dust and light 
              all of which result in collections spending most of their time in 
              storage sheds away from main museum buildings and display specs. 
              The virtual museum may, in the first instance, provide an opportunity 
              to display more of the collection more often. Virtual museum spaces 
              which allow objects to be chosen from databases and viewed within 
              contextual environments could see the creation of intriguing virtual 
              galleries constructed individually for each new visitor.</p>
            <p>Virtual museums may provide the potential for all object collections 
              to be viewed randomly anytime a visitor enters the virtual space. 
              Display spaces in turn could be programmed to construct themselves 
              at the moment of perception and events take place without curator 
              anticipation of visitor interests. Dynamic database driven vrml 
              which learn the habits and likes of the user are being developed 
              at the same time that virtual reality software is allowing construction 
              of virtual spaces in real time. Robocam technology which surveys 
              physical space from a given point has the potential to overlap both 
              physical and virtual environments. </p>
            <p>The museum represents a social and political ordering manifest 
              in the registration, classification and display of objects. </p>
            <p>Having established a recognisable typology, the museum has concentrated 
              on engaging the viewer in the narrative of the collection. By offering 
              interpretative display spaces which allow the audience to engage 
              with the discussion of ideas as a significant aspect of the presentation 
              of objects, collections being used to support complex ideas about 
              who we are, our histories, cultures and societies. </p>
            <p>The museum continues to form part of the political, moral and social 
              discourse, whether at the level of suggestion, or discussion through 
              the development of exhibitions based on controversial, sensitive 
              or entertaining material. The virtual museum takes its cues from 
              the traditional museum in that it too will be responsible for ordering 
              and representation within some social, historical or political context. 
              Within the virtual environment, the visitor has access to the entire 
              collection and in turn the opportunity to map his own journey through 
              the museum space. </p>
            <p>With many museums digitising their collections for both archive 
              and web access, the virtual gallery has the potential to draw information 
              on objects and collections not only from a single museum but on 
              national and international basis. This type of collaborative venture, 
              global access to object collections world wide falls within the 
              continuing rhetoric of ‘information super highways’ and ‘global 
              villages.’ The language of world wide web delivery remains in a 
              quasi science fiction state led by a belief in the unmitigated strength 
              of the technology. </p>
            <p>Fisher (<a href="#foot1" name="foot1back">1</a>) suggests that 
              the museum holds a position of power by sourcing, acquiring and 
              ordering cultural artefacts and this in turn creates its monopoly 
              of history, society and culture. He speaks of the public museum 
              as being involved in the instruction of history, culture and society 
              and the museum display of material as an attempt to impart that 
              knowledge. He calls this a technology of series, - the display of 
              objects within a series of spaces which are not just representational 
              but act as an itinerary of following which the visitor must perform. 
              &quot;<i>The museum converts rooms in to paths, into spaces leading 
              from and into somewhere.</i> (<a href="#foot2" name="foot2back">2</a>)</p>
            <p>Fisher explains that this motion through space is an act of recapitulating 
              history itself, a relentless forward motion and that the stroll 
              through the museum is an act in harmony with history and the museum 
              and not the object, which the museum has hidden in history. </p>
            <p>Bennett(<a href="#foot3" name="foot3back">3</a>) suggests that 
              while the ‘new museum’ forms part of a new discursive space in which 
              ‘man’ functions as metanarrator and archactor of the story of his 
              own development, we will not understand the function and order of 
              this space if viewed solely as a compensatory space in the face 
              of ruin of human subject. Nor can we focus solely on its representational 
              aspects. He offers that the museum space is not somehow separate 
              from the representation of the object, but that movement leads to 
              establishing links between visitor and history rather than object. 
              This reflection on movement through space has reaffirmed the desire 
              to explore three dimensional space in the virtual museum as a method 
              of linking the visitor to context, that is story and history rather 
              than the specific object of a specific collection. </p>

            <p><b>The Virtual </b></p>
            <p>Movement through the virtual gallery constitutes a political act 
              in that the representation medium is one steeped in heroic rhetoric 
              of the power and progress of technology. The represented object 
              gains in political status through the museums’ ability to reduce 
              and present material in this way. The virtual reality offers new 
              modes of perception and opens new spaces for the imaginary. </p>
            <p>Boyer (<a href="#foot4" name="foot4back">4</a>) comments that while 
              every avant guard artist makes self-referential claims that unconventional 
              modes of representing reality and new state of the art sensibilities 
              are emerging, it is worthwhile to compare these testimonies to some 
              of Walter Benjamin’s writings in order to understand the continuing 
              legacy of how technology promises progress yet often destroys or 
              dissimulates. </p>
            <p>There are, '<i>in all technological advances, both progressive 
              and regressive outcomes and while new experiences and processes 
              may occur, each step forward is fraught with anxiety and omission</i>.'(<a href="#foot5" name="foot5back">5</a>) 
            </p>
            <p>Boyer uses Walter Benjamin’s ‘bibliographic allegory’ to speak 
              of the metaphor of Paris as a city of mirrors. Here, Paris can be 
              read through historical memories, fragments of information, words 
              written in her honour, yet she resists careful analysis and merely 
              reflects back to the reader one of the infinity of images or forgotten 
              fragments found in her reading rooms or in mirrored effects. This 
              reading of the city is interpreted in Jacque Tatti’s film ‘Playtime’ 
              where the fragmented images of historic Paris, the memory of the 
              city and past moments are reflected in the cool modern materials 
              of built environment - reflections which can only be seen but never 
              entered. </p>
            <p>Boyer uses this allegory as a metaphor for the virtual worlds of 
              electronic technology. She establishes this dialogue through the 
              fundamental understanding of ‘hypertext.’ <i>as a process of non-sequential 
              electronic reading and writing that offers the reader/writer a series 
              of branch points within an interactive computer network from which 
              to choose. It is a vast / assemblage that enables the user to shuttle 
              constantly back and forth among words, images, sounds, maps and 
              diagrams. (<a href="#foot6" name="foot6back">6</a>)</i></p>
            <p>The hypertext system is based on associative indexing and connectionist 
              modes of thought rather than traditional methods of categorisation 
              such as library card classification schemes and fixed sequential 
              readings such as those found in the museum.</p>
            <p>Within an interactive hypertext environment, links between spatial 
              components be they texts, photographs, animation, film or sound, 
              can be made in a random associative manner at the click of a computer 
              mouse. </p>
            <p>This definition has immediate impact on the digitisation of museum 
              collections and storage management. If a specific object is sourced 
              and viewed through random associative clicking through interactive 
              hypertext environments, the actual location of the real object becomes 
              less important. One no longer searches the collection of a particular 
              institution, but searches all institutions for a particular collection. 
              All subsidiary information can be viewed by accessing search engines 
              and asking for specific topics. </p>
            <p>Boyer reflects on the many metaphors of cyberspace and the proliferation 
              of dialogue which refers to some element of non-space, of the labyrinth 
              qualities of the non specific virtual space, but contained by memory 
              space. ‘………….<i>Numerical images can be assessed directly from a 
              given electronic network and submitted to morphogenetic changes, 
              at which time they quickly become contra - minated by different 
              user manipulations and refigurings. Conse- quently, images no longer 
              constitute a window on the world, they are no longer controlled 
              by linear perspective and seen at a dis- tance; the spectator now 
              penetrates into figural space, gaining access to representations 
              within the electronic network or to image programs that are never 
              stable but are constantly in the process of being made and remade, 
              formed and deformed. Thus a new topol- ogy of the image is established, 
              one that offers multiple and para- doxical hybridisations between 
              the mode of generating images and the mode of perception, between 
              figurative thought and logical- numerical codes or languages. (<a href="#foot7" name="foot7back">7</a>)</i></p>
            <p>Having explored the integral role of movement in the understanding 
              of historic context, the lack of linear perspective and representation 
              of figural space (that is space which can be mapped out and embellished 
              by rapid and repetitive accompaniment) form the basis for translating 
              museum collections to three dimensional virtual environments. .</p>
            <p><b>Immersion</b></p>
            <p>The metaphor of labyrinth speaks of worlds which confront our bodies 
              and our experiences of space and overlay new experiences of order. 
              The labyrinth has always been a spatial conception with metaphors 
              of disorientation, while in the virtual, Boyer speaks of them becoming 
              ‘meta-labyrinths or strange knots and irrational dizziness. (<a href="#foot8" name="foot8back">8</a>)</p>
            <p>Queau (<a href="#foot9" name="foot9back">9</a>) notes that meta 
              labyrinths are abstract and formal, not material; they are constantly 
              moving and changing into structures that cannot be imagined. He 
              suggests that it is not so much a matter of losing ones’ way and 
              the development of entirely new languages with which to move between 
              the formal models and generated images of ‘the virtual’ and the 
              sensual experience they provide as we move through virtual worlds. 
              Queau suggests that once we are deep within computer generated cyberspace, 
              we are obliged to pay close attention to the links and nodes that 
              interlace reality and appearances, illusions and symptoms, images 
              and models. ‘<i>Full immersion in the virtual means that everything 
              in it relates to the synthetic reality of cyberspace, and not to 
              a exterior physical space.</i>’ </p>
            <p>This proclamation suggests that cyberspace is finite, made up of 
              the parts, whether seen or unseen, which are programmed into the 
              experience. Does this then suggest that the medium dictate the message 
              or richness of the experience? </p>
            <p>So many virtual museum sites remain two dimensional representations 
              of text and images, spatial components linked by nodes and accessed 
              by random associative clicking of the mouse. The immersion Queau 
              suggests seems richer and more participatory than such two dimensional 
              representations. This belief in the power of immersion through two 
              dimensional representation seems out of place in the context of 
              the rhetoric which is spoken about the virtual environment. </p>
            <p><i>‘The virtual’ represents a complete world; it saturates one’s 
              consciousness, it surrounds one’s imagination, it seizes all one’s 
              attention. There is a kind of violence that ‘the virtual’ exercises 
              on the user’s sensibility, against which there have to be methods 
              of resistance.’ (<a href="#foot10" name="foot10back">10</a>)</i> 
            </p>
            <p>Boyer suggests that this provisional acceptance of technology as 
              cited through historic examples of the invention of iron, can be 
              compared to the grudging acceptance of ‘the virtual.’ With ‘the 
              virtual’ we find feelings of awe shrouded by terminal terror toward 
              the powerful communication devices which make them possible. Here, 
              however, electronic technology operates silently and subversively 
              and those applications involving memory and artificial intelligence 
              are presented as mysterious and beyond comprehension. Thus the metaphors 
              of energy and force which were predominant in the discussion of 
              industrial technology have little relevance to the virtual. Their 
              narrators will need to develop new imagery that <i>‘….adequately 
              characterises the concealed and fluid processes of computers as 
              well as the centreless and net-like structures they enable.’</i>(<a href="#foot11" name="foot11back">11</a>) 
            </p>
            <p>Boyer suggests that cyber narrators have borrowed worn out imagery 
              and conventional terms to describe emergent technologies and have 
              yet to deal with the fear of technology, fear associated with interruption, 
              cessation of information, of sensory overload and excess information. 
              Nor have they delved into their ’hallucinatory’ images of freedom 
              and liberation - which is how the virtual is perceived, to discuss 
              the precariousness of electronic existence. Finally, they have yet 
              to address the issue of what is means to be human when the subjective 
              self can now be projected onto the computer screen. (<a href="#foot12" name="foot12back">12</a>)</p>
            <p>This discussion of immersion is undertaken to describe the spatial 
              conditions within which the virtual museum will operate. The interpretative 
              agendas of modern museum display rely on the interpretation and 
              presentation of narrative and object, contextual information which 
              forms the greater part of informing the observer of the historic, 
              social, political and cultural context of the object. </p>
            <p>In an attempt to resolve the translation of narrative from traditional 
              to virtual forms, Murray (<a href="#foot13" name="foot13back">13</a>) 
              uses the definition of ‘the multiform story’ to describe a written 
              or dramatic narrative which presents a single situation or plot 
              line in multiple version. These narratives give us the opportunity 
              to explore multiple possibilities allowing us to hold contradictory 
              events in our minds, to be aware of the limitless intersecting stories 
              of the actual world. </p>
            <p>This description well describes the virtual museum in its ability 
              to display a fragmented multiplicity of images. Where the visitor 
              may become entangled within the possibility of so many options, 
              this technology may do away with the painful possibility of missing 
              information. Murray suggests that giving the audience access to 
              the raw materials of creation runs the risk of undermining the narrative 
              experience. She then parallels this form of narrative within the 
              medium of three dimensional photography. The audience can be so 
              closely identified with the situation that the filmic techniques 
              of medium and wide shots are not longer necessary. </p>
            <p>Context provides details and place within the space. Murray describes 
              her frustration in experiencing three dimensional cinema, in the 
              imax cinema where seeing extraordinary detail and being unable to 
              explore and manipulate her position in relation to that detail produces 
              this response. ‘<i>…..I am uncomfortable at these moments be cause 
              the three-dimensional photography has put me in a virtual space 
              and has thereby awakened my desire to move throughout it au- tonomously, 
              to walk away from the camera and discover the world on my own. ‘</i>(<a href="#foot14" name="foot14back">14</a>) 
            </p>
            <p>This discussion of the translation of narrative to three dimensional 
              virtual environments can be transferred to the interpretive qualities 
              of museum display and form part of the argument for the introduction 
              of dynamic technologies with the virtual space. </p>
            <p><b>Dynamic database driven vrml </b></p>
            <p>The specific technology known as dynamic database driven vrml is 
              a webserver extension which provides dynamic information based on 
              a visitor’s identity and associations with other people, places 
              and things. Frameworks for the management of complex inter-relationships 
              with options for integrated reviews, preferences, performance and 
              event timetables, reviews and related media have been developed 
              in real world conditions. (<a href="#foot15" name="foot15back">15</a>) 
            </p>
            <p>This technology, developed by a South Australian company, Virtual 
              Artists, is now known as the ‘Virtual Community Engine’, (VCE). 
              It provides the informational landscape in the form of tables, fields 
              and their behaviours and relationships. All the pages in a VCE are 
              stored within the database. A comprehensive set of META TAGS empowers 
              designers to add simple but powerful structural templates, automate 
              email responses and provide a user extensible set of present VCML 
              (Virtual Community Modeling Language) example pages and settings. 
            </p>
            <p>The VCE will generate automatic pop up menus for dates times, gender 
              and opinions. You can build nested layers of structures. Built in 
              Java script objects generate Javascript as needed. It includes uniform 
              set of table verbs and a comprehensive set of tables and relationships. 
            </p>
            <p>Effectively, the VCE offers complete Web based content control 
              so that each user can be kept up to date by accessing real audio 
              and video. Quicktime vrml, gifs, jpegs and stories from their browser. 
            </p>
            <p>Automatic cookie management is used to provide highly customised 
              interfaces which develop over time. All cookies used by the VCE 
              are stored in the RAM of the client browser only and are not stored 
              permanently. Many people share their browsers and the accuracy and 
              security of the information is part of the notion of a developing 
              community. </p>
            <p>When you log into a VCE as an editor you will receive a different 
              set of tools. With permission, you can maintain the site with a 
              simple forms based interface, adding and validating your information 
              and editing and scheduling stories. When you log in as a member, 
              you can edit your own information, your own events, your own performances 
              and write your own reviews. </p>
            <p>So how does all this technology benefit the virtual museum? What 
              application can be found for this engine which will serve all the 
              needs of museum management and visitor. Perhaps an answer can be 
              found in the relationship between this technology and the idea of 
              the ‘virtual curator’. </p>
            <p><b>Virtual Curator </b></p>
            <p>Kerendine (<a href="#foot16" name="foot16back">16</a>) suggests 
              that the key for the design of the virtual museum is to allow users 
              to be as free as possible from the controlling preconceptions of 
              the traditional museum. She considers the central processes of collection, 
              selection, order and arrangement to be the starting point of the 
              museum.. Museum as interpreter of political, social or cultural 
              act remains the product of such processes but the ongoing argument 
              of interpretation and faithfulness to history and culture suggests 
              that these products are not universal truths. </p>
            <p>To describe the process where the user can manipulate both objects 
              and stories, facts and values simultaneously, the term ‘virtual 
              curator’ has been proposed. The virtual curator is one who has access 
              to the storage of objects and has the opportunity to construct meanings 
              from a choice of objects and data. The underlying metaphor is not 
              that of a pre classified exhibition is which the user can passively 
              select one of a limited number of paths, (<a href="#foot17" name="foot17back">17</a>) 
              but, one where each item in the collection can have hyperlinks to 
              other items so that the user can construct a particular path according 
              to personal interest.</p>
            <p>If this is the case, the VCE engine could become the cornerstone 
              of the virtual museum. Smith (<a href="#foot18" name="foot18back">18</a>) 
              suggests that the larger and more profitable the museum, the greater 
              the opportunity to define and digitise collections for world wide 
              web access. In Australia, the major museums represent only a handful 
              of existing museum institutions. Rural, regional and specialist 
              collections may well suffer the double destabilising force of fewer 
              funds and greater reliance on sponsorship and ‘ or beneficiary support 
              but they too hold enormously important collections within historic 
              and cultural contexts. </p>
            <p>Isolation, regionalism and exclusion from major international markets 
              hinder Australian opportunities for competing on a world wide platform 
              of access and equitability within the digital environment. </p>
            <p>Could a technology such as dynamic database driven vrml make Australian 
              collections competitive on in global cultural institutions. Could 
              business terms of ‘value adding’ be adopted and the technology become 
              the facilitator in discussions of access and equity.. </p>
            <p>Projects </p>
            <p>To demonstrate methodologies for applying the technology to virtual 
              museums, I will site two projects undertaken in collaboration with 
              museums and industry. The first is in its preliminary stage and 
              involves translating non object based cultural material into a virtual 
              environment. The second is a project which was established specifically 
              to develop a methodology for the application of the technology with 
              a cultural context. </p>
            <p>‘A Twist of Fate’ is an exhibition / interactive experience about 
              refugees. It has been devised and produced by the Migration Museum 
              of South Australia. It explores the circumstances which might cause 
              an individual to become a refugee and highlight the kinds of decisions 
              made by those who must leave their countries due to war, religious 
              or political oppression. It introduces the visitor to a number of 
              refugees who are now living here and show the contribution being 
              made to Australia by refugees. </p>
            <p>A Twist of Fate would appear to be an ideal exhibition subject 
              to explore as a virtual environment with the added application of 
              the VCE technology. The nature of ‘refugee’ status suggests an exhibition 
              which is not reliant on object collections but one which must establish 
              the architectural space in which to immerse the visitor and provide 
              a simulation of refugee condition. </p>
            <p>Ideally, the translation of the exhibition into virtual environment 
              would specify a methodology for interpreting museological material 
              within virtual space where that material is not reliant on object 
              collection. The final exhibition would have the potential to be 
              accessible to a wide audience through the world wide web, with opportunity 
              of appearing as a travelling exhibition nationally and internationally. 
            </p>
            <p>The second project, for which we have developed a small prototype, 
              is provisionally named Origami. Origami uses the VCE technology 
              to establish a database of objects and a hyperlink interface.The 
              site consists of three dimensional, virtual spaces which begin to 
              explore the scale and perspective relationship between virtual space 
              and the desk top computer screen. In future prototypes more immersive 
              environments will be explored. These spaces are accessed by clicking 
              through standard vrml interface. As you move through the space you 
              come across coloured squares which lift and morph into three dimensional 
              objects. For the purpose of this demonstration, folded shapes which 
              are well coloured and lit will serve the theatrical purpose of museum 
              object. </p>
            <p>The objects are explored by the viewer then, according to the clicking 
              time between views, the program either deposits the form onto the 
              wall or continues rotating it at eye level for the viewer. Text 
              is offered and again, according to viewer interest, is either detailed 
              or very simple . The objects paste themselves onto walls allowing 
              the viewer to revisit the sites, gain more information on specific 
              objects and save the tour. </p>
            <p>At some stage, one of the squares becomes a frame and the user 
              has access to the Robocam technology, essentially, surveillance 
              equipment linked to a web browser, allowing real time video of specific 
              sites which have some relevance to the matrix of information relating 
              to specific objects. </p>
            <p>The space takes on visible three dimensional qualities by the display 
              of those objects within the invisible wall grid - fulfilling the 
              preliminary notion of the space constructing itself as the user 
              moves through it. The viewer leaves the space and all information 
              moves from the walls to their original positions. The visitor should 
              be left with an overwhelming sense that each time he / she re enters, 
              objects and information will be different; ie: the display is created 
              from the visitors apparent interests as documented at the preliminary 
              web interface. There should be provision for saving the visit to 
              allow the visitor to relive that particular museum experience.</p>
            <p>Both projects rely on the visitor acting as curator, using interactive 
              medium to explore and define their own experience of the museum 
              space. They begin to explore the possibility for immersion within 
              the virtual space and the objects collections themselves are no 
              longer restricted to collections held by one museum but collections 
              held by multiple institutions. </p>
            <p><b>Conclusion </b></p>
            <p>This global village of collection access and unlimited hyperlinks 
              would be enormously expensive and probably decades away from being 
              commercially viable. Even so, this environment holds special interest 
              in that objects themselves no longer hold the reverence of collected 
              object, the curator no longer imparts management quantities of information, 
              but the visitor, with unlimited access to this and other collections 
              has unprecedented access to extraordinary resource material.</p>
            <p>Using this configuration, the museum takes on a wider role than 
              entertainer, educator or interpreter. It now accepts a dominant 
              role within cultural institutions by fearlessly demystifying object, 
              gaining in political status by reducing and presenting culturally 
              specific material in this way. History, culture and politics are 
              accessible through random viewing and interpretation and the museum 
              applauds the viewer’s ability to establish individual translations 
              of collections and context. </p>
            <p>This paper has sought to specify an appropriate application for 
              the technology known as dynamic database driven vrml. It has explored 
              the interactive nature of the technology making reference to various 
              readings on emerging roles for museum professionals. It has attempted 
              to bring together theories of immersion, the virtual and the virtual 
              curator and has used two project examples to attempt to specify 
              a role for this particular technology. </p>
            <p>The research and project work are in their infancy but, with continued 
              exploration of three dimensional space respresentation and object 
              immersion, the technology sited could well form part of the complex 
              tools used to ensure wide accessiblity to both collections and histories 
              within the virtual museum.</p>
