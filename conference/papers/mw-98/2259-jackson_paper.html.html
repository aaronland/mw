          <h3>Using the Web to Change the Relation Between a Museum and its Users</h3>
          <h4><a href="../../bios/jackson.html">Roland 
            Jackson</a>, Martin Bazley, Dave Patten (Science Museum, London) and 
            Martin King (Bulbourne Internet Training)</h4>
          The Internet will change irrevocably the relationship between museums 
          and their users.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;The Web allows and arguably requires museums to enter increasingly 
            into dialogue with their users in new ways. The unidirectional presentation 
            of content, accompanied by the 'Unassailable Voice' <a href="#ref1">(1)<a name="back1"></a></a> 
            of museum commentary, will need to evolve into a more interactive 
            and responsive relationship through the new electronic media, problematic 
            though that may be <a href="#ref2">(2)<a name="back2"></a></a>.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;A number of museums have deliberately sought and incorporated 
            perspectives from their visitors within their physical walls. In the 
            UK, examples include allowing the selection and presentation of art 
            exhibitions and providing space for individuals to display their own 
            collections of objects.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;While it is possible for the public to occupy and affect the 
            physical exhibition space of a museum it is much easier and cheaper 
            online. In addition, the capacity of the Internet for communication, 
            synchronous and asynchronous, makes it possible to make contact and 
            develop long-term relationships with the public. Two excellent and 
            contrasting examples of such approaches are those taken by the Bellingham 
            (WA) public schools <a href="#ref3">(3)<a name="back3"></a></a> <a href="../http://wwwfms.bham.wednet.edu/lobby.htm"  target="_blank">http://wwwfms.bham.wednet.edu/lobby.htm</a> 
            and Illinois State Museum <a href="#ref4">(4)<a name="back4"></a></a> 
            <a href="../http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/athome/index.html"  target="_blank">http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/athome/index.html</a>, 
            and a further paper by Deborah Howes gives useful perspectives on 
            developing classroom links from museums <a href="#ref5">(5)<a name="back5"></a></a>.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;The Science Museum has experimented with a variety of conferencing 
            methods, including e-mail (analysed in an interesting academic paper 
            <a href="../http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/education/framed_email.html"  target="_blank">http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/education/framed_email.html</a>) 
            and a Web-based forum <a href="../http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/education/forum.html"  target="_blank">http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/education/forum.html</a>. 
            However, it is the STEM project that forms our main approach to the 
            development of substantive relationships with educational users through 
            online means.&nbsp; 
          <h4> The STEM project</h4>
          <h4> Purpose</h4>
          The STEM project <a href="../http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/education/stem/"  target="_blank">http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/education/stem/</a> 
          encourages students and teachers to create their own perspectives, projects 
          and educational resources related to the Science Museum and to make 
          them available on the Web by publishing them on their own servers. Information 
          about the resources is sent to the Science Museum (via a Web-based form) 
          and can then be made available on a database resting on the Science 
          Museum's server. Links to all the contributions are accessible through 
          the database, which is searchable freely or by particular criteria, 
          such as topic and age-range. This project builds on the increasing opportunities 
          for people everywhere to present their ideas via the Web.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;At an educational level, the project explores the extent to 
            which students and teachers can be motivated and supported, through 
            this medium, to reflect on their experience of a visit (real or online), 
            and thereby enhance the educational value they gain from visiting. 
            Other educational activities can be built around it in the longer-term, 
            from conferencing to joint projects. Another significant educational 
            project of this type, not associated with museums, is ThinkQuest <a href="../http://www.advanced.org/thinkquest/"  target="_blank">http://www.advanced.org/thinkquest/</a>.&nbsp;

        <td width="450"> 
          <p>&nbsp;At an institutional level, the project can be seen as a first 
            step in exploring the extent to which the nature and role of the museum 
            itself can be reinvented. The museum's educational users are encouraged 
            to reflect on the museum and its subject matter and to restructure 
            and reinterpret it for easy public access. Potentially this process 
            could lead to establishing longer-term relationships between the museum 
            and many of its users. It should also result in the creation of more, 
            and different, perspectives than could ever be achieved by the staff 
            of the museum alone.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;The project has a wide range of intended outcomes, both products 
            and processes.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;The most obvious outcome will be the production of a set of 
            published resources and perspectives relating to the educational use 
            of the Science Museum. The motivational incentive of seeing material 
            published on the Web in association with an institution such as the 
            Science Museum is clearly a significant factor in encouraging participation. 
            So also is the possibility of winning prizes in a competition supported 
            by Toshiba, who have sponsored the project for an initial period of 
            three years. Given time, it should be possible to develop a set of 
            high-quality educational resources available to all, extending the 
            published resources produced by the Museum's own staff. Initially, 
            we would simply like to see as many participants and contributors 
            as possible and are aiming for up to 50 resources in the first year, 
            many produced by groups of people. In the longer term, of course, 
            quality becomes much more important. That, and the relationships developed 
            with schools, will be our criteria of success.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;Equally significant outcomes are those relating to the processes 
            nurtured by this project. It is often difficult for museums to know 
            how they are being used educationally and to find ways of ensuring 
            that the experience of the visit is more than passing excitement and 
            has the maximum chance of leading to longer-term learning. This project 
            helps meet both these challenges, firstly by providing a means and 
            incentive for teachers and students to explain how they used the Museum 
            and to share it with us, and secondly by encouraging substantial reflection 
            on the visit in the course of developing the Web resource.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;There is one further substantive process-related objective. 
            Most schools and colleges are feeling their way onto the Internet 
            in the UK, stimulated by the commitment of the UK government and the 
            launching by the government in January 1998 of the prototype National 
            Grid for Learning <a href="../http://www.ngfl.gov.uk/"  target="_blank">http://www.ngfl.gov.uk/</a>. 
            This project gives schools an educational rationale and motivation 
            for starting to explore the potential of the Web beyond information-searching. 
            The Science Museum is playing its part in the development of Internet 
            capability in schools nationally and a number of schools have already 
            taken steps through this project beyond those they would otherwise 
            have undertaken.&nbsp; 
          <h4> Case studies</h4>
          St John's Angelltown School, Brixton&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;St John's is a multicultural, inner city, primary school. The 
            school has had two computer and modem links to the Internet for a 
            few months. Some of the children have been involved in a project on 
            water conservation and irrigation. This culminated in a videoconference 
            link from the Science Museum to children from a school in Philadelphia, 
            hosted by the Franklin Institute as part of activities for Public 
            Science Day in the US on 12 February 1998. The project inspired the 
            children to make a video and to produce Web pages to publish their 
            ideas and success to the world. A day was spent working with five 
            10 and 11 year olds showing them how to produce their material in 
            Web page format. By the end of the day they had all had experience 
            of scanning and editing photographs, typing information into a Web 
            page using Microsoft Word, laying out the page using tables and inserting 
            images and links to the different pages they produced. This meant 
            the children had to sift through their material to select appropriate 
            photographs and write brief accounts of what they had done. The final 
            result will be placed on the school's website, when it is registered. 
            In the meantime it has a temporary home at <a href="../http://www.bulbourne.u-net.com/stem/angelltown/"  target="_blank">http://www.bulbourne.u-net.com/stem/angelltown/</a>.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;Soho Parish School&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;Soho Parish School is described as being "an oasis in a very 
            mixed community", which ranges through street markets, recording studios, 
            theatres, Chinatown and the infamous red-light district. It also has 
            the atmosphere of being a village school in the centre of a city. 
            This school was also invited to participate in the videoconference 
            link to the Franklin Institute and was inspired, because of its location, 
            to look at the theme of "Light in the City". Classes 1 and 2 (5-7 
            year olds) spent some time working on this theme in discovery, pictures 
            and stories.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;The school already had a link to the Internet, but the new 
            computer they had been given had not been set up correctly to dial-up 
            through the modem. A day and a half was spent getting the system running 
            and showing the Science coordinator how to scan and edit pictures, 
            use Microsoft Word to produce Web pages including images, tables and 
            links, transfer files and communicate via e-mail. The training helped 
            the teacher to overcome her initial fears, filled her with confidence 
            and has inspired her to produce an ever-growing website detailing 
            this project. She is looking forward to further visits to the Science 
            Museum and elsewhere to provide more material for producing interesting 
            Web pages. The school website can be found at <a href="../http://www.rmplc.co.uk/eduweb/sites/soho/index.html"  target="_blank">http://www.rmplc.co.uk/eduweb/sites/soho/index.html</a>&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;Verulam School&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;Verulam is a boys' comprehensive secondary school in St Albans, 
            about 20 miles north of London. The school has had several modem links 
            to the Internet for over two years. A group of pupils studying GCSE 
            (15 year olds) and A Level Sports Science (17 year olds) visited the 
            Science of Sport exhibition at the Science Museum. Their teacher produced 
            a worksheet quiz based on the information in the exhibition to encourage 
            a structured use of the visit. This helped pupils to gain a better 
            understanding of the way science is used to improve sporting achievement. 
            Half a day was spent working with the teacher, who had no previous 
            experience of the Internet, to develop the quiz into a format suitable 
            for viewing on screen and for printing. This helped her to improve 
            the overall appearance of the worksheet since it would now be available 
            to a wide audience, not just her class. This illustrates that publishing 
            material on the Internet can encourage production of higher quality 
            educational resources since the prospective audience is so much greater 
            than colleagues in an individual school. The STEM project is thus 
            being used as a means of sharing resources and ideas of how exhibits 
            can illustrate certain parts of the curriculum. The quiz, and answers, 
            is being temporarily housed at <a href="../http://www.bulbourne.u-net.com/stem/verulam/"  target="_blank">http://www.bulbourne.u-net.com/stem/verulam/</a> 
            whilst the school's own website is being redesigned.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;Wimbledon School of Art&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;The lecturer responsible for the Graphics Foundation course 
            at Wimbledon School of Art had been thinking of including a project 
            on designing Web pages in the course. When he heard about the STEM 
            project this became the catalyst and focus for the project. 25 students 
            (aged 18-20) were given three weeks to produce storyboard designs 
            for websites based on various galleries in the Science Museum. Half 
            a day was spent introducing them to the STEM project and discussing 
            aspects of producing educational resources as Web pages. The students 
            then spent two days in the Museum gathering information and taking 
            photographs. Another half day was then spent helping them to get workable 
            outlines to their storyboard designs, which were completed under the 
            guidance of the college staff. Students who have produce good designs 
            will be given time and encouragement to turn their storyboards into 
            real Web pages for access through the college's website.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;This is just one example of how non-scientists are being encouraged 
            to use the Science Museum as a resource. Further examples include 
            schools which are producing STEM resources to show how some aspects 
            of the history curriculum can be taught using the historical galleries 
            at the Science Museum, e.g. History of Medicine and The Secret Life 
            of the Home.&nbsp; 
          <h4> Issues</h4>
          A project such as this is simple in conception but complex in its execution.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;Issues include the purely practical, the quality and longevity 
            of submitted material and the implications for institutional authority.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;At the practical level, work in schools and colleges needs 
            supporting and submitted resources need assessing and managing on 
            the database.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;Practical support within schools and colleges has proved vital 
            as many institutions take their first steps in this area. We have 
            been fortunate in that the sponsorship of Toshiba for this project 
            has enabled us to appoint a 'field officer' in the shape of one of 
            the authors (Martin King), who has a background in teaching and use 
            of the Internet in the classroom. The availability of a roving consultant 
            offers schools precisely the confidence and practical help they need 
            to get started.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;The database is managed via a Web-based administration area, 
            described in more detail below. The project administrator receives 
            automatic notification by e-mail of any new submissions, can edit 
            the information about submissions and can even change some parameters 
            in the database itself on the fly.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;Quality and longevity of submitted material is a key issue.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;In the early days of this project we expect a wide variety 
            in the quality of material submitted. However, part of the aim of 
            the project is to encourage dialogue about educational activities 
            and the nature and quality of the resources produced. The process 
            of feedback from us to potential contributors is valuable in itself 
            as well as potentially establishing longer-term links. A critical 
            element of the project is that submissions reside on the contributors' 
            servers, with information about them on the Science Museum server. 
            Information will date and sites will move. Depending on experience, 
            we may retain links for a specific period (unless the contribution 
            is resubmitted). In addition, we may need to examine automatic means 
            of checking whether Web pages have been updated or moved since submission.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;Then there is the thorny issue of institutional authority.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;We have taken the decision to require contributors to put their 
            resources on their own websites, simply sending us summary information 
            for indexing within the database of contributions. It is clear, therefore, 
            that the resources themselves are the responsibility (and indeed copyright) 
            of the authors, and not of the Science Museum. We make every effort 
            to monitor contributions, but also state clearly that we are not responsible 
            for material encountered outside our website.&nbsp; 
          <h4> Technical aspects</h4>
          And for all you techno geeks out there...just a few details on how STEM 
          works. STEM runs on the Science Museum's Web server. This is a 200Mhz 
          Pentium machine with 128Mb of RAM. We use Netscape's Enterprise Server 
          3.0 running under Microsoft's NT4. The server is connected to JANET 
          (The UK's Joint Academic Network) via Imperial College.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;STEM is built around a program called OYSTER that has been 
            developed Cognitive Applications <a href="../http://www.cogapp.com/"  target="_blank">http://www.cogapp.com/</a>. 
            OYSTER allows simple databases to be implemented, accessed and maintained 
            just by writing HTML. OYSTER combines data from the database with 
            a set of scripts written in an HTML-style language to generate web 
            pages. The OYSTER program can be written in several different forms, 
            for example in C++ or JAVA, but the version installed at the Science 
            Museum is a CGI script written in Perl. 
          <p>&nbsp;STEM is divided into four parts: the HTML pages the users see 
            <a href="../http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/education/stem/"  target="_blank">http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/education/stem/</a>; 
            the Oyster program; a text datafile; and some administration pages.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;Oyster allows four operations to be carried out. It can view, 
            search, update (which may involve creating a new record, field or 
            even database) and delete the database, or selected records or fields 
            within the database. Oyster takes requests from the user and generates 
            a customised HTML response. When a user wishes to submit a new STEM 
            resource they fill in a form about the resource that is sent to the 
            server. Oyster processes the form, adds the resource information to 
            the datafile but marks it as 'needs checking'. Oyster then e-mails 
            the administrator to say that a new resource needs checking. The administrator 
            checks the resource and uses Oyster to update the record's status 
            field from 'needs checking' to 'active', and carries out any other 
            necessary editing. The new record will then appear when users search 
            the database.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;The administration section of STEM consists of a number of 
            password-protected pages. The administration pages allow Science Museum 
            staff to make resources live, update resource information, delete 
            resources and even modify aspects of the database structure on the 
            fly, as well as changing the administration password.&nbsp; 
          <h4> Future development</h4>
          The project is very much an experiment. We can anticipate some future 
          developments already but there will almost certainly be others.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;One major extension to the project is already planned. The 
            Science Museum is a part of the National Museum of Science and Industry, 
            which also includes the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television 
            (in Bradford) and the National Railway Museum (in York). While the 
            three museums are geographically separated, networking allows them 
            to come together more easily in a common project. The intention is 
            to extend the STEM project to all three museums in the autumn of 1998.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;The second significant development is the creation of an analogous 
            project, the COMO project, focused on the topic of materials rather 
            than on museums specifically. The purpose of the COMO project is to 
            support the development of educational projects bringing together 
            schools and colleges, museums and the materials industries. It is 
            inspired by the Challenge of Materials gallery at the Science Museum. 
            The principal sponsor of the Challenge of Materials gallery <a href="../http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/challenge/"  target="_blank">http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/challenge/</a> 
            is the UK Steel Industry and a pilot project is currently underway, 
            led by British Steel, to encourage and support schools to develop 
            projects stimulated by a visit to the gallery and to publish them 
            on the Web. The prototype website <a href="../http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/education/como/"  target="_blank">http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/education/como/</a> 
            contains selected links to websites of educational relevance relating 
            to materials and could develop to become a comprehensive source of 
            projects and links to educationally valuable sites.&nbsp; 
          <p>&nbsp;Many other possibilities exist for the longer term. As relationships 
            develop it is likely that individual schools, colleges, teachers and 
            students will be inspired to create substantive online exhibitions, 
            including the increasing possibility of virtual 3D examples. Those 
            of particular quality or popularity may be highlighted within the 
            database, and it is not impossible that suitable exhibitions could 
            eventually be integrated into the Science Museum's own website. We 
            would like to explore ways by which high-quality perspectives from 
            the public are incorporated more seamlessly with the products of the 
            Museum's professional staff.&nbsp;
