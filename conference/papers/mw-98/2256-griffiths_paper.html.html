          <h3>The World Wide Web and contemporary collecting: a powerful combination</h3>
          <h4><a href="../../bios/griffiths.html">John 
            Griffiths</a>, Science Museum, London</h4>
          <p><b>This paper offers one possible avenue to explore to assist curators 
            in science and technology museums in solving some of the problems 
            encountered in keeping pace with, and ultimately preserving, developments 
            in science and technology. </b></p>
          <p><b><i>1. Collecting policy - background</i></b></p>
          <p>The Science Museum has always tried to keep pace with technological 
            developments since the formation of the South Kensington Museum in 
            1857, six years after the Great Exhibition of 1851. It's current acquisition 
            mission states that the Science Museum 'acquires and cares for artefacts 
            and related contextual material to mark the progress and development 
            of science, technology and medicine from 1700 to the present' <a href="#ref1">(1)<a name="back1"></a></a> 
            . The Museum's collections are very strong in material up to around 
            the early 1970s <a href="#ref2">(2)</a> <a name="back2"></a>and there 
            is little doubt that these historic collections can be seen as representing 
            the progress of science, technology and medicine. In fact a large 
            number of the Museum's most significant and historic items were given 
            to the Museum shortly after they were made or manufactured. However 
            the increasing pace of technological change since the middle to late 
            1970s has meant that it is becoming more and more difficult to monitor 
            progress in many fields of science and technology inevitably putting 
            greater pressure on the curator. </p>
          <p>The Museum is finding that artefacts from the early 1970s through 
            to the late 1980s are being offered from individuals and companies 
            - especially in the fields of printing, telecommunications and computing, 
            to name just three. Hence simply reacting to these offers, let alone 
            beginning to consider more contemporary material, is a vast task in 
            its own right. The Science Museum and other similar organisations 
            have recognised these issues and have begun to address them <a href="#ref3" name="back3">(3)</a>.</p>
          <p>To this end the Museum has begun to target its collecting at contemporary 
            developments but recognises that there are some serious difficulties 
            with this approach. It should be emphasised that this targeting is 
            not at the expense of other collecting activities - the Museum still 
            targets specific historic areas in which the collections are weak 
            and endeavours to fill any important gaps. </p>
          <p><b><i>2. Collecting policy - the problems</i></b></p>
          <p>I would like to outline a few of the major issues attached to collecting 
            contemporary material from the viewpoint of the science and technology 
            curator. Firstly, as already emphasised above, there is the pace of 
            current developments to contend with. This is particularly true in 
            the fields of telecommunications and computing. Museums have to try 
            to identify what is significant amongst the plethora of developments. 
            Secondly there is the acute problem of the reluctance of many companies 
            to donate material due, in many cases, to the financial worth of the 
            items coupled with the difficulty museums have in providing instant 
            public exposure to the items in their galleries. In addition there 
            is the problem with the nature of material that we are trying to collect 
            - many of the artefacts have a very short working life - perhaps as 
            low as two years and hence it becomes more and more difficult to capture 
            these increasingly fleeting manifestations of change. Finally companies 
            are finding it increasingly difficult to find time to work in parallel 
            with museums to preserve the trends in science and technology. Involving 
            companies in the heritage sector and in the task of preserving the 
            developments they are promoting is, not surprising, becoming ever 
            more difficult and demanding. </p>
          <p><b><i>3</i></b>. <b><i>A suggested collecting mechanism </i></b></p>
          <p>I am proposing the use of the World Wide Web as a proactive vehicle 
            for the collecting of contemporary objects by using the information 
            provided by the companies who advertise their products via this medium. 
            The convergence of the nature of the material curators are trying 
            to preserve and the type of product information that is now becoming 
            more readily available on the web should enable this method of acquisition 
            to become a real possibility.</p>
          <p>This method is only meant to complement the other more 'traditional' 
            methods of collecting artefacts, such as targeted collecting and reactive 
            acquisition. It is not meant to replace these more traditional ways. 
          </p>
          <p>The proposal put forward is very much at the ideas stage and has 
            yet to be tested 'in the field' at the time of going to press. The 
            author feels however that it has great potential. </p>

          <p><b><i>4</i></b>. <b><i>The origins of the idea</i></b></p>
          <p>The idea of using the web in this way can be traced to the convergence 
            of:</p>
          <p>a. internal discussions amongst a number of Science Museum staff 
            about the problems faced in acquiring contemporary material in certain 
            high-tech industries, </p>
          <p>b. the use of the web as an active research tool in the acquisition 
            process, </p>
          <p>c. increasing use of the web by companies to advertise their products 
            and the importance in the quality and quantity of information about 
            their products on their web pages, </p>
          <p>d. an awareness of the importance of the Internet Archive (<a href="../http://www.archive.org/" target="_top">http://www.archive.org/</a>) 
            and related projects whose aim is to collect and store web information 
            for use by historians, researchers and scholars and others in the 
            future,</p>
          <p>e. the pressures on museums to make their collections more accessible 
            to their publics.</p>
          <p>One resulting event that followed from (a) was an internal paper 
            drafted by the Curator of Telecommunications (Roger Bridgman) on a 
            'Proactive collecting strategy for communication technology' <a href="#ref4">(4)</a>,<a name="back4"></a> 
            where Bridgman outlines a strategy whereby companies are approached 
            at regular intervals and invited to donate examples of their current 
            products to the collections. The companies would have to prove the 
            significance and typicality of the items they offer, and the items 
            will be chosen only if they meet stringent criteria that demonstrate 
            that the products are representative of the leading technology of 
            that particular period in question. For example one could use market 
            share, 'best buy' ratings, best seller ratings and mentions in peer 
            sampling surveys. The follow up from this would result in those companies 
            getting high-profile media coverage and donors will be encouraged 
            to advertise their association with the project. The end result would 
            be an exhibition at the Museum coupled with the knowledge that the 
            Museum has collected items that are truly representative of that area 
            of technology over the time frame in question. This project was called 
            had the name 'Freezeframe' as a working title, but unfortunately never 
            became a reality.</p>
          <p>The initiative put forward in this paper effectively brings together 
            the medium of the web and the ideas behind 'Freezeframe'. It suggests 
            that we can undertake 'Freezeframe' without actually acquiring the 
            artefacts. Instead we use the web as both the source of product information 
            and the carrier of contemporary technological 'snapshots' via museum 
            home pages. This then will enable museums to use pre-determined selection 
            criteria to decide on suitable acquisitions for their collections 
            as well as providing an archival record of the development of the 
            technologies in question. </p>
          <p><b><i>5. The methodology</i></b></p>
          <p>A visit to any number of company web sites who manufacture and distribute 
            computer hardware (such as Toshiba, Compaq, IBM·) will immediately 
            show the range of products available. They offer very lengthy descriptive 
            information about these, together with additional information - such 
            as press releases and other contextual material. </p>
          <p>Here is a suggested methodology</p>
          <p>&middot; Firstly identify key company web sites that include a high 
            density of products under consideration, such as laptops. One of the 
            criteria here should be the choice of companies that are leaders in 
            the particular technology being considered. </p>
          <p>&middot; The company should then be contacted in order that they 
            are introduced to the initiative and asked if they wish to be involved. 
          </p>
          <p>&middot; A set of project pages is then set up on the Museum's home 
            web site, where the initiative is described and its aims and objectives 
            are clearly defined.</p>
          <p>&middot; Across the range of products and the range of companies 
            chosen, a selection of products (<i>objects</i>) to be featured is 
            made - to a set of pre-defined criteria. This is in essence the same 
            as happens with normal collecting activity, i.e. the products are 
            chosen to selected criteria.</p>
          <p>&middot; On the web pages, set up and capture relevant data fields 
            and selected images from the description of the products selected, 
            plus any other relevant material (such as press releases). Include 
            also the reason the item was included - this description is, as in 
            normal collecting activities, a vital piece of information. Catalogue-type 
            data can be mapped into whatever collection management system the 
            museum is using - for ease of downloading at future dates. </p>
          <p>&middot; This data can be amplified by any other relevant contextual 
            information - eg listing of earlier items from collection, a timeline 
            of the subject matter, links to other relevant web sites, plus narrative 
            and other text that puts the new material into an historical as well 
            as contemporary context. </p>
          <p>&middot; The information on the site should be reviewed at regular 
            intervals and updated, or modified, as necessary and this should be 
            clearly indicated on the site.</p>
          <p>&middot; Finally it is essential to have in place at the beginning 
            of the process a rigid and well-thought out archival and retrieval 
            system. </p>
          <p><b><i>6. Areas of technology that might be considered</i></b></p>
          <p>There are a number of potential areas that might benefit from this 
            approach to collecting. For example:</p>
          <p>&middot; portable pcs, laptops and palmtops</p>
          <p>&middot; software </p>
          <p>&middot; mobile phones </p>
          <p>&middot; smart cards</p>
          <p>&middot; scanners</p>
          <p>&middot; photocopiers </p>
          <p><b><i>7. What does this gives us? </i></b></p>
          <p>A well designed and moderated set of pages set up as above would 
            give us:</p>
          <p>&middot; A virtual 'snapshot', from the museum's viewpoint, of developments 
            in significant and fast moving fields of technology </p>
          <p>&middot; A 'snapshot' that could truly reflect the market place </p>
          <p>&middot; An organised, searchable, archive resource for researchers 
            and historians </p>
          <p>&middot; A highly visible, flexible and dynamic manifestation of 
            the museum's collections as they evolve and the ability to share it 
            with our publics via the WWW </p>
          <p>&middot; The ability to reflect on, and monitor, the products as 
            they evolve and to identify candidates for actual accession to the 
            collections </p>
          <p>&middot; An educational resource</p>
          <p>&middot; Potentially stronger links with companies that develop these 
            products</p>
          <p>&middot; A way of bringing together collecting, virtual exhibitions, 
            interpretation of collections and research under one umbrella that 
            is highly visible and dynamic</p>
          <p><b><i>8. What we can do with the data on the web site? </i></b></p>
          <p>&middot; Use the information (as a function of time) to decide on 
            suitable acquisitions for the collections via suitable selection criteria.</p>
          <p>&middot; Publish on-line commentaries on the developments (by curators, 
            or outside experts) at regular intervals, using these virtual collections 
            and any other contextual information that is relevant. </p>
          <p>&middot; Display on-line exhibitions of the material interpreted 
            and curated by the relevant subject specialist and other commentators. 
          </p>
          <p>&middot; Archive (for future research use) the data in a variety 
            of formats.</p>
          <p>&middot; Use the project as a vehicle for promoting the collections 
            and involving our publics in the process of preservation of technological 
            artefacts and supporting information </p>
          <p>&middot; Use gallery-based web browsers to give the visiting public 
            instant updates of what technologies the museum is actively collecting 
          </p>
          <p>&middot; Use the project as a vehicle for harnessing closer links 
            with industry - making them more aware of the need to be part of the 
            heritage industry</p>
          <p><b><i>9. Conclusions</i></b></p>
          <p>There are plans to undertake a pilot project in the near future based 
            on the ideas outlined above. The author thinks that a well engineered 
            scheme has great potential. It could be used as a platform for museums 
            to begin to use web technology in a proactive and flexible way to 
            record developments in science and technology and, most important 
            of all, share them with the wide range of publics who use museums.
