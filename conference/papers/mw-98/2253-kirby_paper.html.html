            Developing Marketable Skills Through a Web-enabled Database Project 
          </h3>
          <h4> <a href="../../bios/kirby.html">William 
            Kirby</a>, Executive Director,<br>
            Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art, Toronto </h4>

          <p> <b>Introduction</b>
          <p> The teaching of new technologies in schools presents valuable opportunities 
            for museum / school partnerships - practical content projects with 
            which to enable students to develop marketable technical skills, and 
            cost-effective methods to assist museums in the automation and dissemination 
            of their collections.
          <p> The Canadian Visual Arts Information Network (CCCAnet) is an on-line 
            database project, profiling contemporary Canadian visual artists and 
            their work along with related information on the visual arts in Canada. 
            Much of the work involved in building the database and developing 
            the CCCAnet website has been carried out by high school and art college 
            students working through partnerships with The Centre for Contemporary 
            Canadian Art (CCCA).
          <p> This presentation will describe the CCCAnet project, the CCCA's 
            Student Interactive Imaging Program, illustrate the student-developed 
            web site, and discuss the economic benefits of developing partnership 
            with schools.
          <p> <b>A National Electronic Visual Art Database</b>
          <p> The Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art was founded as a not-for-profit, 
            charitable arts organization committed to increasing public awareness 
            of the visual arts in Canada. 
          <p> With the belief that cultural information in general could have 
            significant added value when it is shared and re-used rather than 
            being re-collected in different forms by various organizations, the 
            CCCA decided to establish a central, electronic source of reliable, 
            up-to-date visual arts information that would reduce duplication and 
            the need to collect and verify the same or similar information more 
            than once. 
          <p> The CCCA set out to compile a large, up-to-date database of information 
            on Canadian visual artists and their work for distribution over the 
            world wide web. From this central source, it seeks to give the visual 
            arts in Canada a greater overall presence in the world by providing 
            electronic access to quality Canadian visual arts content to the arts 
            community, universities, schools and libraries, and to the general 
            public across Canada and abroad. 
          <p> <b>Working Directly with Artists</></b>
          <p> To ensure the quality of the information it is assembling, the CCCA 
            works directly with individual artists, thereby validating the information 
            at its source. An initial request for participation was sent to 100 
            senior artists across Canada, asking them for 10 slides each, plus 
            supporting information. Sixty artists responded to the first request. 
          <p> Artists chose which slides to send in to represent their careers 
            and supplied the basic image information - title, date, medium, dimensions, 
            collection - and a description or artist statement (optional). The 
            artists were also asked to send in a detailed CV and any other documentation 
            on their work that they wished to include, such as catalogues and 
            clippings. 
          <p> The principles of copyright were resolved from the initial contact 
            with the artists. The project and its objectives were outlined in 
            detail, including details about image resolution, size, etc., and 
            the artists were asked to agree to and sign 'conditions of use' forms. 
          <p> In addition to working directly with artists, the CCCA is working 
            with other visual arts and educational institutions and organizations 
            to bring diverse information together into a continuously growing, 
            comprehensive national visual arts resource and archive. Information 
            from these other sources will keep its own integrity, but clearly 
            will be enhanced by being coordinated within a national context. 
          <p> <b>Student Interactive Imaging Program</b>
          <p> As a charitable organization, the CCCA had extremely limited resources 
            with which to undertake this project. An informal conversation with 
            a high school principal, however, gave us a solution. The Student 
            Interactive Imaging Program was the name given to the collaborative 
            partnership that we developed between the CCCA and Confederation High 
            School in Nepean, Ontario. The high school's creative principal was 
            very active in introducing new teaching methods and opportunities 
            to his school, and had already developed a number of other collaborative 
            partnerships with area businesses. The school was well-equipped with 
            computers and electronic equipment and in all subject areas students 
            were using technology to access, process and publish information. 
            This setup provided an ideal environment in which to begin building 
            the CCCA database.
          <p> <b>Goals</b><br>
            Our goals in setting up this mutually beneficial partnership were 
            educational as well as economic. We set out to introduce into the 
            school a practical content project through which students could develop 
            their technical skills and use the tools of technology to enhance 
            their capacity to learn in a specialized subject area. We also wanted 
            to give them practical business-related experience by working directly 
            with a 'client'.
          <p> Subsequent meetings were held with some teachers and students at 
            the school and it was decided to establish the project right in the 
            school itself. A working area was set up in one of the school's computer 
            labs, with space for the main project computer housing the database, 
            a slide scanner, and two other computers for students to work on the 
            imaging and web site projects. This allowed the students to work on 
            the project when not attending regular classes, encouraged other students 
            to stop by to have a look, and made it possible for other media classes 
            to observe and comment as well. 
          <p> <b>The process</b><br>
            In the early stages of the program, equipment and techniques were 
            tested and a prototype procedure was developed. While the students 
            were remarkably proficient in the technical and creative aspects of 
            imaging and editing, they needed more direct involvement in dealing 
            with works of art. Rather than being creative in their approach, the 
            challenge for them was to be as accurate as possible in matching the 
            resulting scanned image with the original slide. 
          <p> To raise the students' awareness of contemporary art, visits to 
            art galleries and artists' studios were arranged. An artist expert 
            in imaging and photo-editing was invited to the school to instruct 
            the students on the 'finer points' of Photoshop and to help in deciding 
            on the questions of image resolutions and file sizes. Students also 
            browsed the web for other art sites, critiquing them and gathering 
            ideas for use in developing the CCCAnet web site. They also sought 
            out links related to contemporary Canadian visual art to be added 
            to the CCCAnet links directory. 
          <p> <b>Wide range of learning possibilities</b><br>
            The program was subsequently introduced more broadly into the school 
            curriculum. In addition to the students working directly on the imaging 
            project and in developing the CCCAnet website, it soon involved art, 
            media and marketing students working on class assignments such as 
            designing a logo for CCCAnet and presenting the project in various 
            public forums. A number of students were thus engaged in a wide range 
            of learning activities, including: 
          <p> 
          <li>digital imaging with slide and flat-bed scanners, and photo-editing 
            of 35mm slides, 
          <li>database concepts, and data entry of information related to the 
            images and the artists, 
          <li>HTML programming, website design and construction, 
          <li>maintenance of the CCCAnet web site, 
          <li>graphic design, 
          <li>marketing and communications, and 
          <li>contemporary Canadian art and artists. 
            <p> <b>SchoolNet Digital Collections Program</b>
            <p> The Student Interactive Imaging Program has been supported in 
              part by SchoolNet Digital Collections, an innovative program of 
              Industry Canada designed to give young people entrepreneurial and 
              technology-based job experience converting collections of cultural 
              material into digital form. This program is part of the Canadian 
              government's Youth Employment Strategy and makes funds available 
              to engage young people to work with business firms, libraries, museums, 
              archives, schools, community associations, public and non-governmental 
              agencies and other organizations to produce digital versions of 
              their holdings, and to make this material accessible on the Information 
              Highway via the SchoolNet Digital Collections web site.
            <p> The SchoolNet Digital Collections Program allowed the CCCA to 
              hire students to continue working on the imaging and web site projects 
              over the summer months.
            <p> SchoolNet is a federal initiative in collaboration with provincial/territorial 
              ministries of education to help connect all 16,500 schools (including 
              all 417 First Nations schools under federal jurisdiction), and 3,400 
              public libraries across Canada to the Information Highway. SchoolNet's 
              Community Access Project will provide up to 1,000 communities across 
              Canada with access to the information highway through schools, libraries 
              and other related institutions. 
            <p> To date, the SchoolNet Digital Collections Program has supported 
              more than 100 projects concerning the fine arts, First Nations and 
              aboriginal peoples, geography, history, literature, the social sciences, 
              women, labour, business, science and technology. These projects 
              are all on-line, and can be visited at <a href="../http://www.schoolnet.ca/collections" target="_top">www.schoolnet.ca/collections</a>.
            <p> <b>Developing marketable skills</b>
            <p> Hiring students to work on the development of the Canadian Visual 
              Arts Information Network provided a rich, multi-faceted environment 
              that promoted many effective learning principles, and provided practical 
              entry-level job experience that would assist the students in pursuing 
              job opportunities or furthering their education following high school.
            <p> It has been shown that students often become more effectively 
              engaged in learning when they participate in activities that are 
              authentic and which show them the relationship between what they 
              are studying, and what exists in the real world. Students who worked 
              on the design and development of the CCCAnet project not only acquired 
              practical technical knowledge and business-related skills, but for 
              the first time had a meaningful relationship with professional artists 
              and their work, enhancing their involvement in, and understanding 
              of, the visual arts. 
            <p> <b>Enhanced learning environment</b><br>
              The students who worked on the CCCAnet imaging project and developed 
              the CCCAnet web site were engaged in a variety of cooperative roles 
              which also enhanced learning. In the environment provided by this 
              project, students were at different times partners, teammates, individuals 
              and teachers themselves. This diversity of roles provided for greater 
              contextual, real-life learning, and better ensured that the learning 
              was integrated as real world learning should be. This expert / student 
              relationship, which is often difficult to establish in schools, 
              also contributed significantly to the development of the students' 
              understanding of the visual arts. 
            <p> Throughout the project students were encouraged to communicate 
              verbally with each other and with the CCCA's project manager, and 
              to interact with others as their work was critiqued by other students 
              and observors. The school had developed several active relationships 
              with various high tech companies in the area, and there were often 
              senior company officials touring the school, observing the project, 
              and interacting with the students. 
            <p> <b>Public presentation</b><br>
              The project was also presented in various public forums, including 
              a high profile 'Young Entrepreneurs Showcase' where the project 
              team members were able to introduce and discuss their accomplishments 
              with business and technology professionals. 
            <p> The Showcase was held during National Science and Technology Week 
              and took place at Nortel, a major technology firm that is active 
              in student placement projects. Confederation High School was one 
              of fifteen schools to display some of their high technology projects, 
              many of which involved partnerships or collaboration with firms 
              and organizations in the community. A marketing class from the school 
              made posters and handouts to present the project and various students 
              greeted visitors and presented their projects. The first day was 
              open only to Nortel employees and invited guests, and the second 
              day was open to the general public. 
            <p> <b><a href="../http://www.ccca.ca/" target="_top">The CCCAnet World 
              Wide Web Site </a></b><br>
              When student work is valued beyond the walls of the school, the 
              students' passion to learn is increased significantly. The knowledge 
              that their work on this project would be 'published' on the world 
              wide web and contribute to the appreciation of Canadian art around 
              the world inspired the students to produce a quality product and 
              contributed further to an enhanced learning experience. 
            <p> The learning environment provided by the Canadian Visual Arts 
              Information Network and the Student Interactive Imaging Program 
              has been dynamic and continually evolving, as new works were added 
              to the database and changes to the web site took place. It has represented 
              a learning opportunity that could be revisited many times. 
            <p> The CCCAnet web site was launched at a press conference and public 
              demonstration at Confederation High School. The event was organized 
              and conducted by students. Members of the media and guests from 
              the education and business communities were invited. The students 
              involved with the project demonstrated the scanning process and 
              database, and guided guests through the website. 
            <p> The CCCAnet web site is comprised of two main elements: 
            <p> 
          <li>The Canadian Visual Arts Database and 
          <li>The Canadian Visual Arts Links Directory. 
            <p> The database currently presents over 2,000 images of works by 
              more than 75 professional Canadian visual artists, an average of 
              about 30 images per artist. In addition, it includes a visual arts 
              directory of over 2,400 entries (including more than 1,600 artists; 
              over 600 public galleries and artist-run centres; as well as dealers, 
              art consultants, and other visual art professionals and organizations) 
              and information on more than 200 contemporary art exhibitions and 
              publications. Information and images of artists' work are regularly 
              being added to the database as the material is received and as more 
              artists join the CCCAnet project. 
            <p> In the coming months, more of this information will be made available 
              on CCCAnet - detailed biographical information on individual artists, 
              bibliographic references, artists' statements, exhibitions and related 
              visual arts events, and information about art techniques and processes. 
            <p> The main objective in designing and developing the web site was 
              to avoid making it appear like a database, but rather to be more 
              like 'reading' about artists and their work, and the people and 
              events that influenced them. While additional browsing and searching 
              tools, such as browsing by image, will also be added as the site 
              develops, the intent will be to maintain an overall user-friendly 
              interface. 
            <p> The other main element of the website is an extensive links directory 
              which provides links to more than 350 other sites related to the 
              visual arts in Canada, categorized by province and territory, and 
              under the following headings: 
            <p> 
          <li>Artist Sites, Exhibitions and Projects, 
          <li>Artist Groups, Organizations and Resources, 
          <li>Artist-Run Centres and Virtual Galleries, 
          <li>Public Art Galleries and Art Museums, 
          <li>University Art Galleries and Art Museums, 
          <li>Art Dealers, 
          <li>Art Schools and Art Departments, 
          <li>Art Journals, Art Magazines and E-Zines, 
          <li>Cultural Organizations and Government Agencies, 
          <li>Directories and Indexes, and 
          <li>Copyright Sites.
            <p> It is expected that CCCAnet will provide considerable assistance 
              to artists who are faced with keeping many different institutions 
              informed about themselves with up-to-date information, and to institutions 
              that find it difficult to keep information about artists up-to-date 
              due to shrinking resources. Participating artists will need only 
              to keep the CCCA informed of new information for its database and 
              the CCCA can then provide reliable, timely information to a wide 
              range of interested institutions and individuals. 
            <p> CCCAnet will also be of considerable value to curators, teachers 
              and students for teaching purposes and for research on the visual 
              arts in Canada. It will assist publishers in locating images to 
              illustrate books, the media for articles on the visual arts, and 
              visitors from outside Canada in locating Canadian artists and information 
              about them. 
            <p> <b>Conclusion</b>
            <p> The benefits of the Student Interactive Imaging Program partnerships 
              have been many. It has provided students with a practical project 
              through which to learn marketable technological skills, a new opportunity 
              to experience contemporary Canadian art, and a community education-based 
              method to aid in the building of an important national visual art 
              information resource. It has also made it possible for the CCCA 
              to begin building an important cultural resource with modest finances 
              and resources. 
            <p> <b>Success stories</b><br>
              Working on this project not only equipped the students with new 
              skills, but it gave them added confidence to undertake other projects, 
              further their interests in information technology, and even set 
              to up a student business: 
            <p> 
          <li>The student who designed the CCCAnet logo, letterhead and business 
            card was able to build an impressive portfolio and went on to community 
            college in graphic design; 
          <li>One of the imaging students became editor-in-chief of the school 
            website and leads a team of students in designing, editing and maintaining 
            it; 
          <li>The designer of the CCCAnet website, designed his own site and has 
            set up a web design business; and 
          <li>Two other students gained added confidence to better represent themselves, 
            and subsequently were accepted for placements with area technology 
            firms. 
            <p> <b>Opportunities for museums</b><br>
              The concept of developing partnerships between schools and community 
              businesses and cultural organizations is flexible and economically 
              advantageous for all. Many schools are equipped with electronic 
              equipment - computers, scanners, etc. and have a pool of talented 
              students with a wide range of skills and who are motivated to learn. 
            <p> For museums and other cultural institutions such collaborations 
              could provide a valuable, cost-effective method to aid in the automation 
              and dissemination of their collections, provide real opportunities 
              for students to interact intimately with museum collections, and 
              enhance museum and school educational objectives. Creating such 
              authentic learning opportunities enables students to apply their 
              skills while making a valuable contribution to their community, 
              and hopefully will encourage more young people to pursue cultural 
              careers.
