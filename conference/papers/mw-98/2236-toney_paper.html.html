          <p align="CENTER">Introduction</p>
          </b></FONT>
          <p>Like the rest of the world, our work has increasingly been involved 
            with the World-Wide Web since 1996. Although a great deal of what 
            we know about databases and how people use them is relevant to putting 
            databases on the Web, there is still a lot to learn that is new.</p>
          <p> My first Web project was the development of a new interface to an 
            old database. In this case the database was almost 50 years old and 
            had been implemented in two earlier automated systems. 
          <p> <a href="s1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="t1.JPG" align="left" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=1></a> 
            <br>
            <i>Figure 1. The Janus logon screen (click on images for larger version)</i> 
          </p>
          <p>The new system, called Janus, was developed under contract to the 
            J. Paul Getty Trust to provide access to the Census of Antique Art 
            &amp; Architecture Known to the Renaissance.</p>
          <p>Doing such a massive project as my first Web application was truly 
            being thrown into the deep end, although my co-author, who was the 
            interface designer on this project, has been doing this work for several 
            years. The Census consists of records for about 15,000 antique monuments 
            and works of art, and records for 25,000 Renaissance writings about 
            and drawings of these works; there are also 150,000 other records, 
            such as preservation histories and authority records; plus 25,000 
            images. As you can imagine, the information landscape that the Census 
            represents is one that has many dimensions and relationships. Our 
            job was to make this complex data explicable, navigable, and easy 
            to use.</p>
          <p>Our overall goal was to create a user experience that enabled effective 
            browsing and searching of the content, while affording the best use 
            of the technology and the available bandwidth. For example, we enabled 
            single-click access to supporting vocabularies, so it would be easy 
            for the user to create queries. We also chunked search results into 
            digestible bits of information, using image thumbnails and icons to 
            represent information about the search results. In this way, the user 
            would not be overwhelmed by detail about the results of a search, 
            but could choose which results to pursue. By using image thumbnails, 
            we made judicious use of precious bandwidth, allowing the user to 
            decide when to commit resources to downloading a full-size image. 
            Often the thumbnail had enough information in it so that the user 
            knew whether it was the correct one to pursue.</p>
          <p>Since then, Karen and I have collaborated on a number of other Websites, 
            both for museums and for other organizations. We have discovered that 
            the solutions developed for Janus are applicable to an amazing variety 
            of problems, giving us additional confidence in our approaches. Although 
            the visuals are taken from Janus, this talk is also based on knowledge 
            gained from deploying the MWeb website tool in a variety of situations.</p>
          <p>For more info on Janus, the Census, or our other work, see the URLs 
            listed on the title-page image above. As you can see on the logon 
            screen, there is a freely available demo version of Janus which you 
            can reach from my website. You will also find there links to implementations 
            of MWeb.</p>

          <b><font size=5>
          <p align="CENTER">Databases on the Web</p>
          </b></FONT>
          <p>&nbsp;The World-Wide Web provides a wonderful opportunity to make 
            old databases widely available at low cost. While some sacrifices 
            of functionality are inevitable, the potential to reach a world-wide 
            audience through a standard interface far outweighs the drawbacks.</p>
          <p>The potential is truly amazing. Only four persons in the world could 
            use the first Census system that required a Unix server, a PC, two 
            TVs, and two videodisc players. The second Census system requires 
            a dedicated high-end computer with 8 gigabytes of storage - for a 
            DOS application. Janus, the third Census system, can be used by anyone 
            with a browser.</p>
          <p>All Web applications inherently gain from the numerous benefits that 
            come with the platform: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>they are usable by PCs, Macs, and Unix client computers, regardless 
              of location and modem speed; </li>
            <li>they have graphical interfaces; </li>
            <li>they have hyperlinks for navigation, a wonderfully intuitive method, 
              especially for the general user; </li>
            <li>there is no need to distribute software; </li>
            <li>and most important for museums, they have world-wide availability.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I mentioned sacrifices. The most important one of these is speed. 
            The Web is just plain slow in transmitting data, and this can be compounded 
            by distance and by local networks that must also process the transmissions. 
            Although we generally keep the size of downloaded data small, we wanted 
            to make an exception here to permit the user to see the entire set 
            of values for a given field, without having to ask for it in sections; 
            this is one of the best ways to empower the user to create good search 
            strategies. However, there is no getting around the fact that the 
            complete list of values for a large database can generate a large 
            download. We had trouble with this during the development of Janus, 
            which implements this with the buttons called "See List' in Figure 
            2.</p>
          <p> <a href="s2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="t2.JPG" align="left" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=1></a> 
            <br>
            <i>Figure 2. Seeing a list of all values for a field</i> </p>
          <p>A large list may have tens of thousands of entries (limited to 35 
            characters each, however). These lists take no more than 10 seconds 
            to display in my office, only a mile from my Internet Service Provider. 
            At the Getty, 300 miles away, and complicated by a local network, 
            these lists were unusable; the browser simply assumes the data is 
            unavailable. (We did not abandon this method because Janus was always 
            intended be installed at the Getty using their fiber-optic network.)</p>
          <p>A newer solution used by MWeb is to put on the "See List" buttons 
            the number of values. Since MWeb is installed at museums for public 
            access, speed is even more important since modems will be the primary 
            means of access. Thus in MWeb the user has buttons that say "See all 
            589 values". This involves another trade-off, since the display of 
            the buttons is delayed a fraction to perform the counts, and they 
            cannot be done ahead of time if the database is live; but this is 
            preferable to frustrating the user with a question like "Are you sure 
            you want to see all 589 values?" every time a button is clicked.</p>
          <p>The lesson here is that any large downloads of data must be at the 
            user's option. In a theme that will be repeated throughout, the user 
            should never be surprised except pleasantly.</p>
          <p>The other sacrifice is the poverty of HTML and Javascript for building 
            a sophisticated interface. Karen's original design called for tabbed 
            dialog boxes to group the various Census fields, as in this figure:</p>
          <br clear="all">
          <p> <a href="story2b.gif" target="_blank"><img src="story2.JPG" align="left" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=1></a> 
            <br>
            <i>Figure 3. Original design for Monument Search</i></p>
          <p>However, once an HTML page is displayed, it cannot be modified without 
            a call to the server, which causes delays (although there are now 
            some new ways to make a page seem to change). Since at the time we 
            were designing Janus, Java and ActiveX were not serious options, we 
            had to find a Javascript solution. In the final Monument Search shown 
            in Figure 2, Javascript had to be written for the tabs to simulate 
            scrolling a list of fields.</p>
          <p>In other words, while HTML is an amazing in what it can do with so 
            little, its interface features are impoverished compared to Windows, 
            the Mac, XWindows, or similar platforms. Dynamic HTML, style sheets, 
            and other things in development will improve this, but for public 
            access, you should not use features that are less than two years old 
            or you will reduce the size of your audience.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <b><font size=4>
          <p>Overcoming Limitations of the Web</p>
          </b></FONT>
          <p>How do we overcome these two important limitations of the Web?</p>
          <p>First, we pay a lot of attention to the user's experience, and what 
            is needed to enable a "richer" interface. We design custom interface 
            components that married the "look and feel" of a traditional Microsoft 
            Windows application interface with "Web-interface" designs, such as 
            a persistent navigation bar at the top of the screen.</p>
          <p>Second, we use techniques that address the issues of speed and database 
            access.</p>
          <p>Karen and I hold one principle very dear: that the user of the system 
            is paramount. Simplicity, speed, and meeting user expectations are 
            the goals of all our development work. These are not easy to achieve 
            in querying a large, complex database, which can put heavy processing 
            burdens on the computer. This was one of the major challenges in developing 
            Janus - the Census is so complex that the Unix system often had "response" 
            times (if that is the appropriate word) of 5-10 <u>minutes</u> for 
            some queries. I consider this unacceptable. Period.</p>
          <p>How can the speed problems be overcome? We use three techniques, 
            each discussed below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Preprocessing of the database to simplify searches and reduce 
              the amount of data sent </li>
            <li>Javascript to avoid calls to the server </li>
            <li>Client-side image maps, also to avoid server calls</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <b><font size=4>
          <p>Maintaining Flexibility</p>
          </b></FONT>
          <p>After user considerations, my second concern is always flexibility 
            of deployment. This is something I would encourage you to strive for, 
            as it will be of value to you when the next platform after the Web 
            comes along. Our work implements this in many ways, but two are noteworthy 
            if rather esoteric. First, the query syntax for each type of search 
            is stored in a database, accessed when the user performs a search. 
            Thus the syntax can be changed and new types of queries added without 
            changing the programs. </p>
          <p>Second, a data-access library called ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) 
            is used for all database access. This allows the underlying database 
            management system to be almost anything without changing the programs. 
            The downside - which affects only the developer, not the user - is 
            that all access of the database must be in the standard SQL language, 
            which makes some things harder to program than using direct database 
            commands.</p>
          <p>Later work has shown both these techniques to be equally useful to 
            perform database updates as they are for searching.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <b><font size=5>
          <p align="CENTER">Speeding Response Time</p>
          </font><font size=4>
          <p>Database Preprocessing</p>
          </b></FONT>
          <p>By preprocessing, I mean transforming the data from its original 
            form to achieve better speed. This may involve denormalizing tables, 
            adding redundant data, making hyperlinks in advance, and other techniques.</p>
          <p>Although normalized data and non-redundant data are usually taken 
            to be sacred concepts, they are really of most value in conceptual 
            data models. Performance requires minimizing the number of tables 
            accessed. For installations that do not update the database, we are 
            free to derive a new database from the working one to suit the needs 
            of Web access. The only downside is extra disk space, which is almost 
            free now.</p>
          <p>To speed up searches, I write programs to rip apart the database 
            and reassemble it for performance. Indexing is also given a great 
            deal of attention - more sophisticated indexing is used, even for 
            keywords, than just indexing every word. </p>
          <p>A simple example of preprocessing can be seen in this display of 
            Janus search results, showing which records have images.</p>
          <p> <a href="s3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="t3.JPG" align="left" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=1></a> 
            <br>
            <i>Figure 4. Brief-record display of search results</i> </p>
          <p>Here it would be possible for the CGI program to count the image 
            links for each record and create the label on the fly. But since the 
            number of links cannot change in a read-only database, I saved the 
            user's time by counting the images during preprocessing.</p>
          <p>Another example of preprocessing is the use of a separate table just 
            for image queries, which puts all the data together that is displayed 
            with images (Figure 5). This saves having to get the few fields needed 
            from the main database which can have hundreds of fields per record. 
            The result is that image queries are actually faster than data queries, 
            even though images are inherently slower to transmit and display.</p>
          <p> <a href="s4.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="t4.JPG" align="left" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=1></a> 
            <br>
            <i>Figure 5. Results of image search (bottom cut off intentionally)</i> 
          </p>
          <p>Here, although the same number of records were found, and each image 
            retrieved from a separate file, the response time is quicker because 
            of the separate file. Redundant and denormalized - but efficient!</p>
          <p>A final example of preprocessing: Renaissance notebooks and sketchbooks 
            tend to have been unbound and their pages dispersed throughout the 
            world. Thus it is impossible for a scholar to view the book as its 
            author created it. Janus implements a feature that partially overcomes 
            this problem - it has a page-view for Renaissance documents that shows 
            their images as well as the transcribed text (Figure 6).</p>
          <p> <a href="s5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="t5.JPG" align="left" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=1></a> 
            <br>
            <i>Figure 6. Viewing document pages virtually</i> </p>
          <p>All the labels you see represent multiple levels of links and are 
            built during preprocessing; during output, only the text needs to 
            be manipulated. </p>
          <p>Although the examples focus on manipulating data to reduce the delay 
            for the user, huge speed gains can also result from having searches 
            result in what the user expects, thus saving trial and error. During 
            the successive releases of Janus we paid attention to what data elements 
            were returned from searches, and fine-tuned these in order to minimize 
            follow-up searches. Thus speed must be a priority for both the architecture 
            and the interface design.</p>
          <p>To summarize, speed is an old consideration that is of new importance 
            on the Web. With a traditional application, you have a variety of 
            solutions if performance is unacceptable, the simplest being to use 
            a faster computer. With the Web, however, the transmission delays 
            are unpredictable and out of the developer's control. Thus the emphasis 
            in our work on minimizing the number of calls to the server; and secondarily 
            minimizing the amount of data transmitted, although this is much less 
            important.</p>

          <b><font size=4>
          <p>Javascript </p>
          </b></FONT>
          <p>Javascript is another feature that is good for the user but hard 
            on the developer. It is actually harder than writing functions into 
            the CGI program. But using the CGI program means a delay while the 
            user's request is transmitted, processed, and the results received. 
            Instead, Janus and MWeb user Javascript run by the user's browser, 
            so the results are instantaneous. Of course, when the database is 
            involved, the request must go to the server; but query building, checking 
            user input, processing buttons, and other client-side processes are 
            all done by the browser. Because the displays (which contain the hidden 
            Javascript) are generated by the CGI programs, it meant writing Javascript 
            code in C++. In fact, this work provided a rather traumatic opportunity 
            to program in 5 languages at once: Javascript, C++, HTML, SQL, and 
            the native language of the database management system, only the first 
            two of which are at all similar!</p>
          <p>Here is an example of Javascript to insert the user's selection into 
            the search form:</p>
          <p> <a href="s6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="t6.JPG" align="left" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=1></a> 
            <br>
            <i>Figure 7. Inserting data values with Javascript</i> </p>
          <p>If the user clicks the "Go" button, this search is sent to the server. 
            However, if the user clicks the "Edit" button ...</p>
          <br clear="all">
          <p> <a href="s7.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="t7.JPG" align="left" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=1></a> 
            <br>
            <i>Figure 8. Creating the search string using Javascript</i> </p>
          <p>... the query, created from the fields above using Javascript, is 
            displayed as it will be sent to the server. The user who knows boolean 
            notation can edit the search before sending it (remember, this is 
            an interface for scholars, not the public). If the user changes the 
            default AND/OR operators using the radio buttons in Figure 8, the 
            search string is instantaneously updated using Javascript - no waiting 
            for the server to parse and reformulate the query and send it back! 
            (Field numbers are used instead of names because of the limited space 
            in the textarea, and also to save numerous server calls to translate 
            them, a compromise I'm not too happy with.)</p>
          <p>It might be added here that Java and ActiveX were avoided completely 
            in Janus, partly because of the outstanding security questions, but 
            more because they require the user to wait while large programs are 
            downloaded. As I said before, I don't think the user should ever have 
            to wait.</p>
          <p>Javascript has one severe limitation - it is not implemented the 
            same way across platforms. We had to stop supporting Microsoft Internet 
            Explorer version 3 for Janus because it did not implement Javascript 
            correctly. This was not a problem since Janus was developed for use 
            internally at the Getty, which has standardized on Netscape Navigator; 
            but in later work, I have had to write programming code to have these 
            functions processed by the server for users of IE3. The downside is 
            that using the server instead of Javascript causes delays for processes 
            that the user can expect will not take time (such as jumping to a 
            specific previous display). In fact, functions like the Monument Search 
            you have just seen would not be worth doing without Javascript.</p>

          <p>Client-Side Image Maps</p>
          </b></FONT>
          <p>This is no longer a new technique, but worth mentioning. Image maps 
            are images that perform different actions depending on where the user 
            clicks. Originally, the coordinates of the user's click were sent 
            to the server for action. Now you can embed the logic in your HTML 
            pages so some work is done by the browser. That is how the tabs you 
            see here are implemented.</p>

          <p align="CENTER">Planning the User Interface</p>
          </b></FONT> 
          <p>I hope you'll agree that Janus is a very attractive system. I think 
            the fact that both of us have a passion for clean and attractive interfaces 
            is one of the reasons so much complexity is not overwhelming.</p>
          <p>However, a lot of planning and prototyping is also required. A lot 
            of credit must go to the testing team at the Getty that gave us feedback. 
            By using rapid prototyping techniques, the interface went through 
            many iterations without wasting precious development time. Mockups 
            were done as hand-drawn sketches, then rendered as image maps to create 
            a storyboard of the user interface.</p>
          <p>Here are some thoughts on the user interface for database applications 
            on the Web.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <b><font size=4>
          <p>Simple Searches</p>
          </b></FONT>
          <p>One way to avoid overwhelming the user is by having multiple levels 
            of searching. This is an old idea, but we took it as far as we could. 
            Besides the advanced searching described earlier, we also added a 
            simple way for users to search by keywords, and a simple way to "search 
            by thumbnail" since users indicated early on that images were a crucial 
            part of their browsing and searching process. These latter two were 
            combined into the same screen; we made this look simple, but it has 
            enough power so that the advanced searching is rarely needed: </p>
          <p> <a href="s8b.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="t8b.JPG" align="left" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=1></a> 
            <br>
            <i>Figure 9. Janus Keyword Search</i> </p>
          <p>This is the initial screen after logging on. The essential objects 
            on this screen are only 1 instruction, 1 place to type, and three 
            buttons. On the left are more controls that I'm not too happy with 
            because they distract from the total simplicity of the rest of the 
            screen. I put them in colored boxes to make them look like "sidebars"; 
            that is, not essential to the main purpose of the screen. Even though 
            the sidebars detract from simplicity, for a user familiar with the 
            conventions of graphical interfaces, I believe the functionality is 
            self-evident. But if the user ignores them, the expected occurs - 
            which is what we should strive for.</p>
          <p>In fact the most common search performed consists simply of typing 
            a single word and pressing the enter key. The resulting display (shown 
            in Figure 4) is also fairly simple, given the complexity of the possible 
            results. And the use of links means not having to tell the user how 
            to get to the full record.</p>
          <p>Meeting user expectations also enables the avoidance of instructions 
            and help files. For example, one would hope that typing "apollo belvedere" 
            and pressing Enter would bring up that statue, and in fact it does. 
            This is because the keywords are ANDed by default and are not case-sensitive. 
          <p>A user can truncate one or more keywords by simply adding the most 
            common character for this: the asterisk. Have we needed the Help file 
            so far?</p>
          <p>The first two radio buttons control whether the search will show 
            data or thumbnails. The drop-down list enables the user to search 
            only specific record types; for example, the person authority file 
            can be searched for "Caesar" to find the nine or ten persons with 
            that name, instead of wading through the hundreds of other records 
            with the word in them.</P.



>
          <p>Finally, just as the user can see the complete list of values for 
            any field in the advanced search, the last two radio buttons permit 
            searching the complete keyword index and the Art &amp; Architecture 
            Thesaurus.</p>
          <p>For the record, we could not avoid a Help file - although the users 
            do!</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <b><font size=4>
          <p>Single-Record Displays</p>
          </b></FONT> 
          <p>I haven't yet discussed the single-record display. Users can see 
            the full data for any record, no matter how arcane (such as notes 
            entered by the data-entry person or the barcode number on photographs 
            scanned for the Census).</p>
          <p>The next two Figures show a full record for an only moderately complex 
            Renaissance document:</p>
          <p> <a href="s9.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="t9.JPG" align="left" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=1></a> 
            <br>

            <br>
            <i>Figure 11. Full record for a Renaissance document (2 of 2)</i> 
          </p>
          <p>Here is another use of links to make it simple for the user. All 
            records related to other records have links in both directions. Every 
            field controlled by authority files has a reciprocal link to the record 
            for that authority (the Creator field in the second slide). Records 
            in hierarchies can be clicked on to see their ancestors and descendents 
            (these include not only placenames but monuments and documents that 
            have multiple parts). Every image is a link to its larger sizes. Images 
            and data are linked so that the user can go from one to the other 
            simply. Here again intensive processing of the data was done to take 
            advantage of the potential of hyperlink navigation.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <b><font size=4>
          <p>Saved Searches</p>
          </b></FONT>
          <p>Complex databases can be hard to use. When you do develop a search 
            that gives results you want, it is helpful to permit the user to save 
            it to be used again later. We implemented this by permitting the user 
            to save search strategies. In contrast to the obvious approach, which 
            is to save them on the server, coded by the user's ID, we took the 
            simpler option of storing them on the user's computer. Thus we don't 
            need to maintain a list of users, keep track of expiration dates, 
            etc.</p>
          <p>Since Web browsers have only one way to store data, namely the cookie, 
            this was the only approach available. Cookies have some limitations, 
            not least of which is that some users don't trust them, but I believe 
            they are acceptable if used only for optional functions.</p>

          <p align="CENTER">Imaging Considerations</p>
          </b></FONT> 
          <p>Although using multiple image sizes is not a new concept, a great 
            deal of effort was spent finding the optimum sizes for all monitor 
            resolutions. The goal was to be able to display two images side-by-side 
            on standard 800x600 monitors without having to scroll the images. 
            In addition, a large image can be seen in its entirety at this resolution. 
            On high-resolution monitors, of course, more or larger images can 
            be seen. As usual, the user's needs were the only consideration.</p>
          <p> <a href="s11.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="t11.JPG" align="left" hspace=20 vspace=20 border=1></a>

            <i>Figure 12. Two full-size images</i> </p>

            photographs.</p>

            <br>
            <i>Figure 12. Two zoomed images</i> </p>
          <p>By clicking on the images to zoom them we can easily read the inscription 
            in the left image, and confirm the poor photography and/or scanning 
            of the right image. The point is that no single image size will serve 
            for both the overview and studying the details. Using large images 
            for both slows down the user's experience unacceptably, but large 
            ones are needed when the user wants detail.</p>
          <p>Here is another interface design question. During the design of Janus 
            we considered various schemes for predetermining where and at what 
            size images should open. Finally we realized that for art scholars, 
            no predetermination could be made. Thus any number of images can be 
            opened and the windows can be moved and resized at will.</p>
          <p>A final word on images. These are absolutely marvelous considering 
            what we started from - low-resolution scans of what often were tourist 
            snapshots. Get professional help here; it's worth the money.</p>

          <b><font size=4>
          <p>Progressive Releases</p>
          </b></FONT>
          <p>It is important with large projects to keep the user population interested 
            throughout a long development process. Although the Census is of great 
            importance to a small group of scholars, it is obviously not a major 
            priority to most people. Thus we had to keep our group of testers 
            enthusiastic. One obvious way was to provide a free lunch at each 
            review meeting.</p>
          <p>The other way was to implement what I call "progressive releases", 
            a development process in which the system is developed and released 
            in parts. With Janus, although the development took a year, the first 
            release was out only 21 days after we began. This gave testers their 
            first look at keyword searching, a feature they had been wanting for 
            10 years. These progressive releases are more than prototypes or betas. 
            They are intended to be complete, bug-free releases of part of the 
            system, in order to provide useful features as soon as possible. And 
            in fact Janus was being used by scholars long before it was finished. 
            This approach is more costly, in that finishing work is done on features 
            that may be changed later; but the benefits are higher also.</p>
          <p>Here again I must credit the testing team at the Getty for their 
            prompt and valuable contributions to twelve releases of Janus in eight 
            months.</p>
          <p>There is a danger to this approach besides higher costs. As the simpler 
            features were released first, the demand grew to elaborate these to 
            solve problems better addressed by later features. It was necessary 
            to resist this pressure to ensure that the simple features did not 
            lose their simplicity.</p>

          <p>A final important consideration for databases over the Web is security. 
          </p>
          <p>Passwords are the obvious solution. But we have to ensure that the 
            password process cannot be avoided. The primary means of doing this 
            is to avoid using static HTML pages, since if these can be displayed 
            in a browser they can be used to submit valid database requests. Instead, 
            HTML pages are generated by the server after each request.</p>
          <p>An alternative way is to use cookies to transmit the user's logon 
            information with every request. This was rejected because of inherent 
            security problems with cookies, and even more because of the perception 
            of security problems.</p>

          <p>In designing a new "face" for the Census, we have learned a great 
            deal about the challenges faced by developers in rearchitecting databases 
            to live in a new and dynamic environment such as the Web. These challenges 
            come from attempting to create a compelling and elegant solution in 
            the context of a novel and unsophisticated design/technology environment. 
            By placing the user's needs squarely at the center of our design goals, 
            and by exploiting the available technology with an eye towards the 
            future, we have crafted a solution that answers many of these challenges, 
            and serves as a strong basis as new tools and environments emerge.</p>
