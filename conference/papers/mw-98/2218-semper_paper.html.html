            <h3>Bringing Authentic Museum Experience to the Web</h3>
            <h4><a href="../../bios/semper.html">Rob 
              Semper</a>, Center for Media and Communication, The Exploratorium</h4>
            <p>Despite its lack of 3-D reality presence, the Web has some particular 
              capabilities which make it of great interest to the museum world. 
              It is both a temporal and a spatial medium. It provides the opportunity 
              to meld imagery, text and interactivity. And it provides for both 
              individual as well as group (albeit distributed) experience. These 
              attributes are similar to those offered by the museum experience 
              and this is what makes the marriage between museums and the Web 
              such an intriguing opportunity. It is no accident that two of the 
              earliest World Wide Web applications were museum-like projects: 
              the Library of Congress exhibition of <a href="../http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Experimental/vatican.exhibit/Vatican.exhibit.html" target="_top"> 
              Vatican Art</a> and the University of California at Berkeley's <a href="../http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibit/exhibits.html"

target="_top"> Museum of Paleontology exhibit</a>. 
            <p> Museum use of the World Wide Web has run the gamut from publicity 
              and marketing opportunities to publishing resource to on-line exhibit 
              presentation to real-time connectivity to the museum environment. 
              While much of what museums are doing on the Web follows good Web 
              design rules, museums have a unique role to play when they bring 
              their own public space design sensibilities to their Web work. Along 
              with many museums, the Exploratorium has been undertaking a number 
              of projects which are designed to explore the intersection of traditional 
              museum design and Web resource creation. Over time this work has 
              included the creation of on-line exhibits, exhibitions and experiences. 
              Along the way we have explored how to provide meaningful interactivity 
              for our visitors. Each project has provided lessons about what works 
              and what does not work for this medium. 
            <p>Our goal has been to bring authentic museum experience to the Web 
              and we have found it helpful to keep our museum exhibit designer 
              hat firmly on our head as we explore the use of this new medium. 
              By thinking of the Web resources in museum terms, i.e. exhibits, 
              demonstrations, exhibitions, it is possible to bring the best of 
              museum experience to an on-line audience. Museums have a unique 
              perspective on interaction and involvement honed by many years of 
              public visitation. It is this perspective that can lead museum Web 
              designers as they work in this new medium. 
            <p>This paper will present a brief history of some of our past work 
              and then describe our most recent experiments which focus on real-time 
              interaction be tween the exhibit floor and the Web. <br>

            <h4>ON LINE EXHIBITS</h4>
            <p>The on-line <a

href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/exhibits.html"

target="_top">Cafe Wall Illusion</a> exhibit is one of a series of on-line exhibits 
              based on existing physical Exploratorium exhibits. These on-line 
              exhibits are designed expressly to work directly on the screen. 
              The Cafe Wall illusion at the museum demonstrates a visual effect 
              which occurs when you look at a wall of alternating misaligned black 
              and while tiles. Based on an effect first noticed by the British 
              psychologist, Dr. Richard Gregory, on a cafe wall in Bristol, in 
              the illusion the horizontal lines of a tile set to look to be slanted 
              rather than straight when the black and white tiles are separated 
              by gray mortar and misaligned vertically. This effect disappears 
              if the mortar color is changed to match the tile color or if the 
              tiles are aligned one above each other. 
            <p>In the on-line version of this exhibit, created by Ron Hipschman, 
              the user can change the color of the mortar or move the tiles to 
              make the effect appear or disappear. Sliders under user control 
              allow the on-line visitor to change what they are seeing. The exhibit 
              works directly on the screen just as it does in the museum setting. 
              The interactivity is direct and to the point and the user can experiment 
              with various alternatives at their own pace. The design of this 
              resource (just like that of the physical exhibit) places the effect 
              front and center to encourage play and manipulation first rather 
              than text and context. <br>
            <h4>ON-LINE DEMONSTRATIONS</h4>
            <p>The <a

href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/learning_studio/cow_eye/index.html"

target="_top">Cow's Eye Dissection</a> was one of our first on-line resources 
              and was developed by the Exploratorium for the Science Learning 
              Network in 1995. SLN is a project of science museums to use on-line 
              museum resources and telecomputing to support K-8 inquiry-based 
              school science instruction sponsored by the National Science Foundation 
              and Unisys Corporation. Created by Jim Spadaccini, the Cow's Eye 
              Dissection is an on-line version of the popular Exploratorum demonstration 
              of the same name. Designed to present many of the features of the 
              physical demonstration and to encourage on-line visitors to do their 
              own cow's eye dissection, it includes a step by step visual presentation 
              of a dissection, tips from high school explainers, and information 
              about where to get cow eyes. 
            <p>Besides obtaining the content of this resource directly from the 
              museum demonstration, we tried to add an exhibit-like atmosphere 
              to the on-line experience. An important feature is the addition 
              of audio commentary by the explainers which adds to the verisimilitude 
              of the experience. The real stories of the explainers who do these 
              demonstrations everyday gives the experience an authenticity which 
              makes it more compelling to view. A museum demonstration is part 
              object, part show, part audience interactivity ands this Web resource 
              provides each of these elements for the on-line user. <br>
            <h4>ON-LINE EXHIBITIONS</h4>
            <p>The <a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/complexity/index.html"

target="_top">Turbulent Landscapes</a> project was designed to create an on-line 
              exhibition which was closely related to a physical exhibition. The 
              Turbulent Landscapes exhibition at the museum contained over 20 
              artists works which related to aspects of nature which demonstrated 
              the new field of complexity studies. 
            <p>The Website, designed by Zane Vella, used existing exhibit images, 
              the exhibit audio tour and the exhibition spatial layout to present 
              an on-line exhibition. To help exhibit visitors develop a deeper 
              understanding of the physical exhibition, the Website was designed 
              to be presented on the exhibit floor near the exhibit as well as 
              to be viewed on-line by remote users. A complexity timeline and 
              a complexicon was added to provide background information. This 
              on-line resource took advantage of the material collected for thecreation 
              of a physical exhibit to create an on-line in-depth experience. 
              It also explored the spatial dimension of the Webspace as a way 
              of organizing information about the site. The on-line experience 
              was designed to be rich and multifaceted in the manner of the physical 
              exhibit. <br>
            <h4>ON-LINE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT AN EXHIBITION</h4>
            <p><a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/nagasaki/index.html"

target="_top">Remembering Nagasaki</a> was developed three years ago as a memorial 
              for the 50th anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on the 
              city of Nagasaki in Japan. Created by Exploratorium staff Ali Sant, 
              Marina McDougall and Susan Schwartzenberg, this Website exhibition 
              was based on the photographs of Yosuke Yamahata, a young army sergeant 
              in the Japanese army, who was sent to Nagasaki to photograph the 
              aftermath of the atomic bombings. The Website exhibition appeared 
              on the exhibit floor of the Exploratorium as well as in cyberspace 
              on the Exploratorium server and was designed to provide visitors 
              a chance to explore the relationship between memory and historical 
              events. 
            <p>The Website contained four primary areas. The first was a "Gallery" 
              presentation of the photographs of Kosuke Yamahata. These were be 
              displayed full-screen, and were presented in a way that gave the 
              images the full power that they deserved. The navigation was designed 
              to be very simple and straight forward, and the experience invoked 
              to some degree what it would be like to tour around a gallery of 
              these images on bare painted white walls. The second area was "Atomic 
              Memories" where comments made by visitors about their experience 
              of the Nagasaki bombing were accepted by e-mail and posted on the 
              site. These comments were formatted into a threaded discussion by 
              curator by Ali Sant. The "Commentary" part of the Website invited 
              the public to comment on whole experience of living in the atomic 
              age. The "Commemorations" section of this exhibition was about memorials, 
              in this case a discussion of what it meant to memorialize something 
              such as this event, with links to the memorials that were created 
              for this particular anniversary. This part made use of the real 
              strong connectivity aspect of the web in its presentation of connections 
              to many sites, including the home page of the city of Nagasaki 
            <p>Taken as a whole this web site was an encapsulated museum exhibit 
              visitation. Physically, the Website could be visited at the Exploratorium 
              or from someone's home. Cyberly, the exhibition provided an opportunity 
              to discuss the ideas as if one might with a friend at the gallery. 
              The same principles of image manipulation, or evocative questioning, 
              of allowing interaction between people which work on the museum 
              floor worked on the cyber exhibit floor as well. The extraordinary 
              discussion that developed during the months that this exhibit was 
              on-line far exceeded any of our expectations of community dialog 
              and lead us to the conviction that this new tool of the Web provided 
              museums with a new way of interacting with its public. <br>
            <h4>ON-LINE EXPERIENCE WITH EXPLORATION</h4>
            <p>Recently, the Exploratorium has extended its work of connecting 
              the museum to the cyberworld by creating a program of real-time 
              networked exhibition experiences. The Live @ the Exploratorium project 
              being developed by Zane Vella is designed to connect a remote field 
              experience of scientific discovery in real time with an audience 
              on the exhibit floor of the Exploratorium and then to use this interaction 
              as the basis for a program that is Webcast on the Internet. In Live 
              @, the remote field experience appears as an exhibition on the exhibit 
              floor, and the audience interaction with the remote field experience 
              appears as an interactive program for viewers in homes and schools 
              anywhere in the world. 
            <p>For the initial test of this idea, <a

href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/hubble/" target="_top">Hubble Servicing Mission: 
              Looking Beyond Boundaries</a> the Hubble Space Telescope servicing 
              mission by the space shuttle in February 1997 was used as a foundation 
              for a series of 14 real time Webcast programs. These programs presented 
              the science of the servicing mission, background on the Hubble telescope 
              as an instrument of observing the world, and discussions with the 
              scientists and the technicians who are involved in the support of 
              the telescope's functions. The audience at the Exploratorium could 
              ask their questions of Hubble Space Telescope scientists and discuss 
              space science with Exploratorium staff. This program was Webcast 
              on the museum's Website and net visitors could e-mail or call in 
              their questions to the experts. A prototype Webcast studio to host 
              this event was built on the exhibit floor. The success of this program 
              demonstrated the potential viability of on the floor Webcasting 
              and remote audience engagement. We had almost 1000 visitors on site 
              over 10 days and over 20,000 on-line users. 
            <p>In the spring of 1997 a second test Webcast project called <a

href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/visualize/index.html"

target="_top">Eyeing the Storm</a> was created for schools which presented the 
              art and science of severe storm visualization. A series of on site 
              and remote interviews were presented on the Web and in person at 
              the museum along with imagery of storm visualization and real storm 
              footage. Each production was offered to a specific classroom. A 
              series of five programs were produced from a small on-floor production 
              center. 
            <p>Most recently, as part of the total solar eclipse of February 26, 
              1998 the Exploratorium presented its third Live @ the Exploratorium 
              production titled <a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/index.html"

target="_top">Eclipse: Stories from the Path of Totality</a>. For the February 
              eclipse totality was only visible in parts of the Galapagos, South 
              America and the Caribbean. This project provided the excitement 
              of attending a total solar eclipse to a live audience at the Exploratorium 
              and to a world wide Internet and television audience. The goal of 
              this program was to provide the experience of being at the eclipse 
              as well as provide context for the event by with science experts, 
              exhibits, visual material and Web material that would present the 
              background of the eclipse for the audience at the museum and on-line. 
            <p>The eclipse program was produced for a live audience in our new 
              1500 sq. ft. Webcast studio built on the exhibit floor of the museum. 
              It involved the development of a comprehensive Website on the Exploratorium 
              server along with live two-way production from with an Exploratorium 
              crew which originated from a viewing site on the island of Aruba. 
              Zane Vella and served as coordinating producer for the project and 
              with the help of Noel Wanner produced the Webcast program from the 
              Webcast theater. The Exploratorium sent a field expedition team 
              including Marina McDougall, Kurt Keppler and Ron Hipschman to Aruba 
              to provide coverage of the total eclipse. They were joined by a 
              reporter for Discovery On-line, Hannah Holmes. The eclipse Website 
              was produced by Jim Spadaccini with stories developed by Exploratorium 
              staff. 
            <p>Our idea was to use the activity of the total solar eclipse, which 
              is highly interesting to a broad public, as a vehicle to present 
              aspects of current research on the Sun-Earth interaction. We also 
              wanted to provide a background of past history and the social and 
              cultural aspects of eclipse viewing to help support a discussion 
              of the long-standing interest of people in viewing eclipses wherever 
              the occur around the world. This project was a collaboration between 
              the Exploratorium, NASA's Sun Earth Connection Education Forum which 
              is designed to educate the public about the scientific research 
              activities surrounding the sun and it's relationship to the earth 
              and Discovery Channel On-line, which presents to its on-line audience 
              coverage of scientific events happening around the world. We were 
              fortunate to be able to connect with the Science Museum of Minnesota's 
              travel program which provided a trip for its members to the Aruba 
              viewing site. 
            <p>The new Webcast studio on the exhibit floor of the museum was the 
              key locus of activity, serving as the production as well as educational 
              nexus for this networked event. The production studio is open to 
              the exhibit floor and can hold up to 100 people seated and many 
              hundreds more standing in different locations around the outsides 
              of the studio space. It is designed to be operated by a host who 
              interacts with guest scientists and staff on site at the Exploratorium 
              and with remote scientists and guests from locations around the 
              world. The interaction between the audience and the scientists both 
              at the Exploratorium and at remote locations serves as the content 
              material which was produced and streamed through the Internet from 
              the Exploratorium. The Webcast was visible within the eclipse Website 
              which included background material on the eclipse, the various stories 
              of past eclipse events, as well as a Webchat, e-mail dialog, and 
              archive of images. The studio is designed so that the public can 
              replay past events from an archive as well as view new events. 
            <p>Because of the difficulty of providing two-way IP communication 
              to the island of Aruba, NASA provided a high-bandwidth datalink 
              between the island of Aruba and the Internet using the TDRSS Communication 
              Satellite system. This allowed for sufficient bandwidth to provide 
              both two-way communication to the island of Aruba, as well as Webcast 
              video streaming from Aruba. For the period of the eclipse itself, 
              we also provided a standard one way television satellite video feed 
              from Aruba which was used by large group viewing at schools and 
              museums. In the Webcast studio, three large monitors -- two video 
              and one data -- provided images of the eclipse and information from 
              the Internet. Distributed monitors on the floor of the museum provided 
              additional viewing sites for the public. 
            <p>A preview event Webcast was held the night before the eclipse. 
              Guests at the preview program included solar science researchers, 
              Exploratorium scientific staff, as well as visitors in Aruba that 
              were awaiting the next day's eclipse, and stories from archeoastronomer 
              who talked about past eclipse events. The Webcast of the eclipse 
              itself occurred during a two hour Webcast Thursday morning and was 
              a mixture of video feeds from the floor of the Exploratorium as 
              well as from the Aruba event. The backup video feed was also carried 
              by news services in the United States and around the world including 
              real time coverage by CNN. The eclipse project recorded over 500,000 
              users of the Website, over 10,000 viewers to the Webcast itself, 
              and millions of people received the images and interacted with the 
              event through the television broadcast component of the project. 
            <p>Live @ the Exploratorium places the museum squarely in the center 
              of the design and development of public experiences of exploratory 
              discovery in the world. Future proposed projects include a series 
              of programs on earthquakes, an examination of the underground aspects 
              of a city and the presentation of the research on the discovery 
              of the complete genome of species to name a few. This project demonstrates 
              the potential for opening a museum transparently to the world at 
              large through the use of telecommunication and network while maintaining 
              the museum's central role as an interpreter of objects and events, 
              and as creator of social experience of discovery. <br>
            <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
            <p>As these examples have hopefully shown, museum design and Web design 
              can have a strong interrelationship. Museum sensibilities such as 
              thinking of 3-D exhibits not 2-D books and providing experience 
              not just information mean that museum Web sites can be fundamentally 
              different and more inviting than many designs today. As museum professionals 
              we should not leave our museum design sensibilities on the doorstep 
              as we step into the Web design world. Our spatial, informational 
              and experiential proclivities can serve as in good stead as we look 
              how to use this new medium to fulfill our mission as museums in 
              the future.
