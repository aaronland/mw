            <h3>The Whys of Deinstitutionalization</h3>
            <h4><a href="../../bios/wilson.html">Martha 
              Wilson</a>, <a href="../http://www.franklinfurnace.org/" target="_top">Franklin 
              Furnace</a>, USA</h4>
            <p>I wish that I could say that Franklin Furnace's evolution from 
              an avant-garde presenter to a virtual institution was a conscious, 
              planned and steady process, but it was not. Moments of clarity appeared 
              through the fog, and we're still in a groping phase, checking with 
              various parts of our community for feedback and adjusting our path 
              accordingly.</p>
            <p><b>A Fast History of Franklin Furnace</b></p>
            <p>It all started in 1976, when the fog cleared and I saw that major 
              institutions were not accommodating works of art being published 
              by artists, and decided to gather, exhibit, and sell, preserve and 
              proselytize on behalf of the form that came to be known as "artists' 
              books." I opened Franklin Furnace Archive, Inc. in my living loft 
              (which happened to be a storefront) on April 3rd, 1976. Soon after, 
              Printed Matter, Inc. came into being to publish and distribute artists' 
              books; we reapportioned the pie, Franklin Furnace taking the not-for-profit 
              activities of collecting, cataloging, preserving, exhibiting and 
              related activities like artists' readings, the activity that evolved 
              in turn into the performance art program. Printed Matter published 
              and sold artists' books as a for-profit corporation, (and later 
              sought and received not-for-profit status too).</p>
            <p>Franklin Furnace's presentation of temporary installation work 
              and what became to be known as performance art started right from 
              the get go. The artists who were publishing artists' books were 
              the same ones who considered the text to be a visual medium (Jenny 
              Holzer and Barbara Kruger come to mind). Martine Aballea, whose 
              book was in Franklin Furnace's collection asked if she could read 
              it in our storefront in June 1976. When she showed up in costume, 
              her own lamp and stool, the performance art program was born. Although 
              I called it Artists Readings in the beginning, every artist chose 
              to manipulate the performance elements of text, image and time, 
              from a very simple 1977 performance by Robert Wilson of the word 
              "there" repeated 144 times with a chair on stage, to the rather 
              messy 1983 performance of Karen Finley taking a bath in a suitcase 
              and making love to a chair with Wesson oil. </p>
            <p>Franklin Furnace's niche became the bottom of the food chain, premiering 
              artists in New York who later emerged as artworld stars: Ida Applebroog, 
              Eric Bogosian, David Cale, Guillermo Gomez-Peña, Ann Hamilton, Theodora 
              Skipitares, Michael Smith, Annie Sprinkle, Krzystof Wodiczko, Paul 
              Zaloom, and hundreds of others.</p>
            <p>Around 1980, I perceived another vacuum in the art world. No one 
              seemed to be researching the history of the contemporary artist 
              book in any thorough-going manner, so I tried to do it in a year, 
              hiring four guest curator teams to tackle four 20th century time 
              periods of <em>The Page as Alternative Space</em>. Clive Phillpot 
              organized material for 1909 to 1920; Charles Henri Ford from 1921 
              to 1949; Barbara Moore and Jon Hendricks from 1950 to 1969; and 
              Ingrid Sischy and Richard Flood from 1970 to 1980. After this heady 
              year, Franklin Furnace hired a slew of guest curators to explore 
              the history of the published artwork in even more depth, organizing 
              usually one big exhibit per season such as <em>Cubist Prints/Cubists 
              Books, The Avant-Garde Book: 1900-45, Fluxus: A Conceptual Country, 
              Books by Russian Avant-Garde Artists</em>, as well as thematic shows 
              such as <em>Artists' Books: Japan, Multiples by Latin American Artists, 
              Contemporary Russian Samizdat, Eastern European Artist Books</em>. 
              Taken together, the magazines and catalogues published to document 
              these exhibits form a history that is still not available under 
              one cover.</p>
            <p>Although we had been reprimanded by Hugh Southern, Deputy Chairman 
              of the National Endowment for the Arts and Benny Andrews, Director 
              of the Visual Arts Program for our exhibition entitled <em>Carnival 
              Knowledge</em>, the conservative tide in this country was not strong 
              enough in 1984 to be taken seriously. 1990 was a fateful year, however. 
              In this year, the Democratic Governor of New York State, Mario Cuomo, 
              cut the NYSCA budget in half, decimating support of Franklin Furnace 
              to the tune of $100,000 from one year to the next; and Franklin 
              Furnace exhibited an installation by Karen Finley entitled <em>A 
              Woman's Life Isn't Worth Much</em>. This in itself was not a crime, 
              but by May of 1990 she had already been branded "the chocolate-smeared 
              young woman" by columnists Evans and Novak and conservative forces 
              in Washington had gained much credibility and momentum. Following 
              Karen's exhibition, Franklin Furnace was turned in to the New York 
              City Fire Department as an "illegal social club," closing the performance 
              space; and our program and financial records were audited by the 
              General Accounting Office, the National Endowment for the Arts, 
              the Internal Revenue Service, and the New York State Comptroller.</p>
            <p>Clarity started to be visible through the fog. The cost of cataloguing 
              and conserving Franklin Furnace's collection of artists' books published 
              internationally after 1960, by this time the largest in the United 
              States, was going up; but the public support of small arts institutions, 
              especially those that chose to exhibit "difficult" art, was going 
              down. Further, the beautiful, 19th-century Italianate loft in which 
              Franklin Furnace was living was made of wood, while its collection 
              was made of paper. Lastly, we did not own the building, so bringing 
              the space up to code for performances and installing climate control 
              equipment for the maintenance of the collection did not add up financially. 
              Also the landlord was suing us to get us to vacate so he could sell 
              the building. In the Fall of 1990, I made the decision to mount 
              Franklin Furnace's performance program "in exile," in other institutions' 
              spaces around town such as Judson Memorial Church, Cooper Union, 
              The New School, P.S. 122, Dixon Place, the Kitchen, NYU. And then 
              on Halloween of 1990, the landlord dropped dead, and his daughter 
              offered the artists who occupied 112 Franklin Street the opportunity 
              to buy the building.</p>
            <p>Ideas were forming in the aftermath of the events of 1990. One 
              was to place the collection of artist's books in the embrace of 
              a larger institution that would value it, and continue to catalogue, 
              exhibit, lend and enlarge its scope. The Board made inquires at 
              a few select institutions, including the Walker, the Guggenheim, 
              and MOMA. But it was really Clive Phillpot's resolve to acquire 
              Franklin Furnace's collection for the MOMA library that made this 
              deal happen in 1993. The terms that were important to us were that 
              Franklin Furnace's name would remain on the Museum of Modern Art/Franklin 
              Furnace/Artist Book Collection; and that its collection policy would 
              be open to any artist who claimed, "this is a book." It remains 
              the only uncurated collection at MOMA. We believe that this year, 
              the collection will become accessible through Franklin Furnace's 
              website so artists may look up their works to see how they are catalogued.</p>
            <p>The other idea that galvanized the Board was that we should raise 
              the money to make the down payment on purchasing Franklin Furnace's 
              loft, and eventually bring the "c" copies of the artist book collection 
              home to be handled casually, get coffee stained and read, as the 
              artists intended; and to bring the performance art program home 
              as well. In short, our idea was to renovate Franklin Furnace's loft 
              into a downtown art emporium. After a Summer long search in 1994, 
              we hired Bernard Tschumi to prepare a physically and visually accessible 
              design that was still sensitive to the historic nature of the building 
              and the neighborhood. And we hired a Capital Campaign Consultant 
              to help us raise the $500,000 it was going to cost to make the design 
              a reality.</p>
            <p>During the 1994-95 season, four separate donors asked us, "Have 
              you been to the American Center in Paris?" Here is an institution 
              that sold its Beaux Arts building downtown to build a Frank Gehry 
              building on the outskirts of Paris--and ran out of money to mount 
              its program. The fog cleared in the Summer of 1995 when, sitting 
              in my sister's kitchen staring at Mount Rainier, I realized that 
              Franklin Furnace would never be remembered for its blonde oak floors, 
              but rather for its program--and I was raising half a million dollars 
              for the wrong purpose. Omigod.</p>
            <p>In September of 1995, I took a radical concept to my Board: I wanted 
              to sell the darn building, and concentrate the program on broadcasting 
              artists' ideas. This was not really dissimilar from the original 
              purpose publishing itself served in 1910 when the Italian Futurists 
              threw 800,000 manifestoes berating past-loving Venice onto the heads 
              of folks emerging from church. Except now there were all sorts of 
              new ways to broadcast artists' ideas including broadcast and cable 
              television, and the Internet. They really went for it, especially 
              the plan to get performance artists on broadcast television, which 
              I ultimately failed to accomplish; more on the vertigo that accompanied 
              this decision later. </p>
            <p>1996 was another fateful year. By the time we had made some decisions 
              that changed the path of the organization's history:</p>
            <p>1. We collectively pledged to look beyond artist development, our 
              focus for 20 years, toward audience development. Could we cultivate 
              a broad audience for the consumption of avant-garde art by utilizing 
              electronic delivery media?</p>
            <p>2. We decided to sell the loft, a step which would separate us 
              from real-estate based presentation activity and commit us to an 
              unknown course with rapidly evolving technology.</p>
            <p>3. We embarked on a multi-year project to electronically catalogue, 
              digitize and build a relational database of our program files from 
              1976 to 1996. My dream for Avant-Garde New York, the working title 
              of this project, is to keep going after we have completed bringing 
              our own history on line, to make accessible the archives of Fashion 
              Moda, Minor Injury, JAM Gallery, the Collective for Living Cinema, 
              ABC No Rio -- small, but important centers for avant-garde art activity 
              now out of business-- to make the "unwritten history of American 
              art," as Jeanette Ingbermann, Co-Director of Exit Art calls it, 
              accessible to both scholars and aficionados. This is not something 
              I think I can do on my own. So I am trolling now for a an institution 
              affiliation that would give Franklin Furnace the stable context 
              necessary to raise the kind of money this project will require. 
              Well, a girl can dream.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But back to the whys and hows of deinstitutionalization: Altogether, 
              Franklin Furnace got in trouble four times with the forces of darkness 
              in Congress and among the conservative Christian right. Most recently, 
              in September, 1996, the Christian Action Network mounted a performance 
              art spectacular on the steps of the Capitol Building to protest 
              the $132,000 in federal dollars (not true) we were spending on our 
              <em>Voyeur's Delight</em> exhibition, and to call for the death 
              of the NEA. Their press release linked us with the virus eating 
              away at the health of the body politic, and the performance included 
              two coffins and a guy dressed up as the Grim Reaper. (I think it 
              says something when the Christian conservatives recognize the power 
              of performance art tactics in getting their point across.) But this 
              time, Franklin Furnace was building its website as its public face, 
              so I decided to put up a page called U-B-D-Judge, to collect public 
              comment, both positive and negative, regarding the works in exhibition. 
              We reprinted CAN's press release in its entirety, and ours; and 
              asked permission of the artists to publish their work on our site, 
              each piece accompanied by the artist's statement explaining why 
              Jocelyn Taylor had a speculum up her vagina, for example. Sure enough, 
              this page has generated both positive and negative comment, intelligent 
              and stupid comment, all of it I believe valid and important to the 
              discourse that surrounds and emanates from contemporary art.</p>
            <p>In 1996-97, I mounted a pair of 20th Anniversary exhibitions to 
              go out of the physical space with a bang: <em>Voyeur's Delight</em>, 
              organized by Barbara Rusin and Grace Roselli examined the power 
              of looking; and <em>In the Flow: Alternative Authoring Strategies</em>, 
              traced the evolution during the last two decades of art as flowing 
              information rather than property, including works by the Thing, 
              X Art Foundation, Guerrilla Girls, Frank Gillette and David Ross, 
              Sol LeWitt, Louise Lawler, Group Material and others. On February 
              1, 1997 this exhibition closed, and Franklin Furnace's website was 
              launched as the institution's public face. </p>
            <p>Also during the fateful year of 1996 I developed a pilot tape to 
              show to cable and broadcast television producers in what turned 
              out to be a futile effort to get performance artists on television. 
              It was called <em>Untitled</em>, and it showed a wide array of artists' 
              approaches to the subject of sex -- since the commonly-held belief 
              is that that's all we think about anyway, I wanted to show approaches 
              that were humorous, despairing, scary, satirical of corporate exploitation 
              -- a wide range of approach. Some members of my board felt this 
              represented a tactical error, and that I would ever succeed in catching 
              the interest of TV execs. And indeed, after meeting with Lorne Michaels, 
              Tom Freston, Eileen Katz, Mary Salter, Susan Wittenberg, Sue West 
              and a bunch more executive types, it became clear to met that broadcast 
              and cable television represent an entrenched industry, one that 
              has become highly regulated, developing "standards of conduct" and 
              clear taboos in order to continue to blast content directly into 
              our homes.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, I was being courted by Internet-based broadcast companies. 
              Sensory Networks, Thinking Pictures, Pseudo Programs -- these start-up 
              companies were broadcasting over the net from facilities such as 
              clubs, a gorgeous blue-screen studio, a funky loft in Soho. At first, 
              I was put off by the tiny, jerky image and the cramped, smoke-filled 
              facilities that Sensory Networks was proposing to use to mount a 
              performance art program. I wanted the gorgeous studio that Thinking 
              Pictures had built on West 16th Street, and entered a long conversation 
              with their principals that would have included asking Laurie Anderson 
              to kick off our virtual performance program. But on September 19, 
              1997 our deal crashed and burned over the issue of money: Thinking 
              Pictures wanted $4,000 for each use of their studio -- that was 
              before I paid my artist fees, staff and publicity costs. So I went 
              hat in hand back to Galinsky at Pseudo Programs. Galinsky had proposed 
              a performance program in collaboration with Franklin Furnace during 
              the Summer of 1997, but I blew it off because their studio was not 
              capacious, nor set up for visual artists -- Josh Harris, the founder 
              of Pseudo, had established it as a radio network first, and was 
              luckily at the same moment (Fall, 1997) preparing to become the 
              largest producer of television-style broadcast over the Internet. 
              Further, these guys wanted MORE Annie Sprinkle. They were not only 
              not afraid of the tendency of artists to get naked, they embraced 
              the challenging stuff wholeheartedly.</p>
            <p>The last year has not been particularly pleasant for me, the chief 
              executive officer of Franklin Furnace. When the ink dried on the 
              contract selling Franklin Furnace's loft in September, 1997, the 
              Board went into a paroxysm of doubt about what a virtual institution 
              was, what its programs should be and for whom, so we entered a soul-searching 
              process that included a series of town meetings with artist and 
              others within and without the artworld; and I commenced an itinerary 
              of travel and research, attending important conferences such as 
              Silicon Alley 98, Circuits@nys, and this one, and commenced to travel 
              to meet and talk, to re-evaluate and re-imagine Franklin Furnace's 
              role as an "alternative space" at the end of this century. now almost 
              a year into the process, I'm pretty happy with how Franklin Furnace 
              has managed to become Janus metaphorically -- the Roman god of passageways 
              and patron of new beginnings -- who is represented as having two 
              faces, one looking forward and one back. During these last three 
              years, Franklin Furnace has developed ways to maintain its role 
              in the contemporary artworld as an organization which both fosters 
              the art of the future and archivally cares for its past.</p>
