          <p>This paper will describe some of the current issues considered by 
            the Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN) in a project undertaken 
            to re-design access to museum information on its website &lt;<a href="../http://www.chin.gc.ca/" target="_top">www.chin.gc.ca</a>&gt;. 
            As the title suggests, this new access refers both to a new role envisioned 
            for users, the electronically connected participants in the creation 
            of a collective knowledge resource and, as well, to the new role for 
            the collective resource. </p><b><u>
          <p>The Canadian Heritage Information Network</U><br></B>
            The Canadian Heritage Information Network is a special agency within 
            the federal government department of Canadian Heritage. CHIN's mission 
            is "to broker effective access to heritage information for public 
            education and enjoyment, and for the collective benefit of Canadian 
            museums." <a name="GN1"><a href="#N1">[1]</a></a> </p>
          <p>Twenty-five years ago, when the leading-edge information tools in 
            cultural institutions were the typewriter and the file card, Canadian 
            museums, through CHIN, were the first in the world to attempt the 
            creation of an electronic inventory of a nation's heritage, "an ambitious 
            undertaking, not merely envisioned but also achieved". <a name="GN2"><a href="#N2">[2]</a></a> 
            It was done by providing electronic collection management services 
            to the participating museums. During this time, three national inventory 
            databases covering the disciplines of Humanities, Natural Sciences 
            and Archaeological Sites were created, representing information from 
            Canadian museums on 25 million objects, specimens and sites. CHIN 
            has also been actively involved in the development of data standards 
            for museum information nationally and internationally. </p>
          <p>Over the last three years, CHIN has shifted its focus from collections 
            management services to the provision of museum information over the 
            Internet. Today, CHIN's website is an electronic gateway to Canada's 
            rich cultural and natural heritage. Working with member museums and 
            partners, CHIN provides public access to the treasures of Canadian 
            museums and related national and international heritage resources. 
            Advanced search and retrieval tools work with integrated information 
            on millions of museum objects. CHIN's long term vision and role is 
            to ensure that audiences of all kinds - general public, museum professionals, 
            school children and senior researchers - can enjoy effective access 
            to museum content that meets their diverse needs, promoting an important 
            and visible presence for Canadian museums in the world of networked 
            information. <br>

            <br>
            </a></B></FONT>CHIN's change in focus has been the result of a<b><font size=4> 
            </b></FONT>transition both in the user's behavior and the system's 
            behavior. The trend is toward the provision of tailored and adaptive 
            responses to different types of usage situations. </p>
          <p>The movement from "Come and Get it" towards "Seek and You Shall Find" 
            and the transition from a "Central Resource" to "An Information Meta-Center" 
            is as dramatic as the shift of emphasis from product to process, from 
            structure to system, from one-medium transmission to multimedia communication 
            and from hierarchy to network. </p>
          <p>It represents the transition from pre-organized information to a 
            more open system:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Information is no longer to be gathered only from the margins 
              to the center or bottom-up, stored in one physical place, according 
              to similar rules. </li>
            <li>It means moving away from top-down information delivery towards 
              communication processes based on dialogue. </li>
            <li>Information is no longer to be deprived of its specifics or context 
              during the process of generalization. </li>
            <li>It represents a transition towards new access possibilities with 
              links between specific and general, classification and context. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>In essence this transition is the way towards the development of 
            a framework where the user can create new organizations of information 
            and contribute thereby to the development of the knowledge environment. 
            The ability to see things from an unusual perspective and to produce, 
            from that, insight to an original organization of familiar components, 
            something that did not exist before, is defined as creativity. </p>
          <p>The capacity of the knowledge environment to enhance creativity, 
            which produces new knowledge, is one of the core elements of the transition.<br>

            Meta-Center<br>
            </a></B></FONT>Theoretically, an information Meta-Center is the integrated 
            state of the accessible or available information. It is not a centralized 
            collection of information but a series of relationships established 
            among multiple information resources. It involves managing the process 
            of communication or relationships among the components and constantly 
            re-building the network of connections. It is intimately linked to 
            a group of resources, in close and continuous communication, and it 
            classifies the similarities and differences among them. Thus, through 
            a cumulative process of experience, the Meta-Center has the potential 
            to build up a more complete knowledge of the information environment, 
            acting as a specialized gateway or access agent.<br>

            The transformation discussed has been accompanied by a shift in the 
            users' attitude towards information. It is increasingly recognized 
            that information is both material and tool, source and target. The 
            distinctions between maker and user have started to fade. The maker, 
            the user, the artifact, technology and intuition have gradually been 
            united in a participatory creative process or "global consciousness" 
            <a name="GN3"><a href="#N3">[3]</a></a>. Users no longer consider 
            themselves simple consumers of information. They are increasingly 
            becoming participants, partners, initiating dialogue, needing informational 
            space for reflection and interpretation, and a means to express and 
            apply their own views and creative capacity. </p>
          <p>This new attitude has been signaled and expressed convincingly by 
            scientists and contemporary artists <a name="GN4"><a href="#N4">[4]</a></a> 
            alike. Networked communication used only by scientists to collaborate 
            with each other in their pursuits, is now available to the general 
            public, who has been invited to join in. Visitors to art exhibitions 
            are invited to participate interactively in the process of experiencing 
            or even constructing the work of art. </p>
          <p>The enhanced focus on creativity invokes the two main components 
            of thinking and language: intuitive concepts and logical concepts. 
            It is the new information environment, characterized by connectivity 
            and multimedia expression that induces a new degree of perception 
            and awareness of reality, intuition and logical construction.<a name="GN5"><a href="#N5"> 
            [5]</a></a> This is where art and science meet. </p>
          <p>Take for example, a working model or mechanism of a possible human-computer 
            interaction, proposed by a web artist. Is it science, art or technology? 
            Or is it an object or a process? </p>
          <p>The meeting between art and science or technology is a recurrent 
            theme, being expressed today by the appearance of a growing number 
            of prestigious articles, publications, institutions and conferences 
            dedicated to this topic.</p>
          <p>But why is this topic of such interest? We talk about effective access 
            to the information environment. Effective access is creative and dependent 
            on the "intellectual" component where the new or original organization 
            of information items plays a significant role.<br>

            Access to on-line information has become one of the hot topics of 
            the builders and users of the interactive knowledge environment. In 
            the virtual world, the collective presence and role of the museum 
            community can be enhanced by providing effective access and retrieval 
            strategies that relate the different types of available information, 
            offer the potential for integrating and extending its value and relevancy, 
            and help reveal implicit narratives embedded in it. Beyond this, consideration 
            must be given to the potential experiences that can be offered to 
            on-line audiences, given the variety of their perspectives and expectations. 
          </p>
          <p>Roy Ascott, <a name="GN6"><a href="#N6">[6]</a></a> describing the 
            nature of on-line display, in his article entitled "The Digital Museum" 
            considers that: </p>
          <p>"To talk about the digital museum is to talk about two things - behavior 
            and architecture". </p><b><u>
          <p>Behavior</U><br></B>
            Behavior refers to the dialogue between the users and the knowledge 
            environment. It consists of the ways the users can express their expectations 
            and the ways the responses are adapted or tailored to meet these expectations. 
            In essence, it consists of the processes or methods for communication, 
            learning, knowing, perceiving or organizing the available on-line 
            information. </p><b><u>
          <p>Architecture</U><br></B>
            Architecture refers to the building blocks of the organization of 
            information and communication on multiple levels of meaning and interpretation. 
            Architecture is the reflection of the knowledge of the domain, mirrored 
            by the arrangements of the components to form patterns different from 
            what could occur by chance.</p>
          <p>While defining the "Intellectual Access" Project at CHIN, in addition 
            to behavior and architecture, we came across a third, very important 
            component, which we added to our research domain.</p>
          <p>"To talk about the digital museum is to talk about its context".&nbsp;</p><b><u>
          <p>Context </U><br></B>
            Context refers to<b> </b>the situation or environment in which cognitive 
            activities occur. The surroundings, conditions or influences, especially 
            those affecting the existence or development of the objects under 
            consideration, such as place, time or social roles, are all factors 
            influencing how the context is interpreted. </p>
          <p>In undertaking basic documentation of collections, museums have already 
            created architectural structures of knowledge representation, classification 
            and interpretation. Museum websites are virtual realms that now could 
            be oriented towards actions or processes of contribution and construction, 
            creation and remembrance, interaction and dialogue. Museum information 
            is so important in the process of constructing a virtual culture, 
            that is, where myth and action, memory and future can be linked. This 
            specific virtual environment is fulfilling simultaneously two important 
            functions. The ideational function represents the world around us, 
            connecting the natural to the artificial, the real to the virtual, 
            challenging traditional notions of the authentic versus the reproduced, 
            creating a new feeling of beauty or value. The interpersonal function 
            enables social interaction.</p><b><u>
          <p>Intellectual Access</U><br></B>
            With these three components in mind,<b> </b>(behavior, architecture, 
            and context), CHIN undertook a project called "Intellectual access" 
            to investigate and test access requirements. The goal of the project 
            was to develop an intelligent tool to provide effective and enjoyable 
            access to on-line information developed by Canadian museums, to guide 
            and to assist the use of the information, and to encourage the development 
            of a community resource and collaborative creativity. Owing to the 
            complexity of the problem a phased approach was adopted. This paper 
            will report on the first two phases: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Phase 1: Redesigning Access - The Integrator<b> </li></B>
            <li>Phase 2: Redesigning Access to the National Inventories.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Architecturally, the project looks at the potential of the integration 
            of all the available knowledge components and, as integration is a 
            process of increasing the number of connections, it has proved to 
            be very much dependent on representation and design issues. What seems 
            ordered and comprehensible on one level, becomes meaningless on another: 
            for example 20,000 paintings organized by style as opposed to 20,000 
            paintings with no organization.</p>
          <p>Behaviorally, the project considers procedures for providing various 
            ways to access information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>by dynamic overviews, according to concepts or points of view 
              chosen by the user </li>
            <li>using the organization of a categorization tool, a well-established 
              thesauri </li>
            <li>through pre-defined points of access. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The access procedures are conceived more like construction tools, 
            using filtering and browsing techniques. But as the access procedures 
            are addressing an integrated environment and, as integration is a 
            process of increasing the number of connections, categorization is 
            a basic element for the provision of meaningful information. </p>
          <p>In the future, the project will investigate means to develop dialogue, 
            a narrative course and its components.</p>
          <p>From the context perspective the project will study the notions of 
            authentic versus reproduced and methods to contextualize information.</p>
          <p>Access, interaction and integration are the processes that enable 
            the creation of the knowledge artifact. The knowledge artifact is 
            the result of the user's research. It is a construct, a map or a maze 
            of relations, a hypothetical system, having an interpretive value, 
            involving a distributed collection of inter-connected knowledge entities 
            or a new set of relationships established by the architectural components 
            of the information environment, possibly creating new behavior. <br>

          <p><a name="Re1">Redesigning</a> Access - Phase 1: "The Integrator"<br></A></B></FONT>
            The first phase of the project dealt mainly with the architectural 
            aspects related to the development of effective access. The idea was 
            to construct an information architecture where a specialized tool, 
            which we have called "The Integrator", could access and search the 
            different available resources.</p>
          <p>The integration operated only on a conceptual level. The goal was 
            not to alter the individual resources. Each resource was to be accessed 
            sequentially and was supposed to work according to its own rules, 
            navigation options and interface issues. In this way, the identity 
            of each participating resource and its uniqueness expressing the original 
            and creative aspects was respected. Synthesis occurred only as an 
            intermediary between the query formulation and the results display.</p>
          <p>Access to an integrated environment, possibly including distributed 
            resources, with different conceptual and physical organizations, for 
            example, references, thesauri, dictionaries, inventories, bibliographies, 
            etc. - was defined as one of the main goals of this phase. The user 
            was offered one single entry point to the whole information environment. 
            The search request could be addressed to all the available resources 
            or to any combination, according to the user's choice. The first answer 
            the system provided was a quantitative one: 300,000 or 10 or 50. The 
            provision of this intermediary phase, interfering between the search 
            request and the results display is an incipient form for dialogue. 
            The quantitative answer might stimulate the user to refine or broaden 
            the search to get a browsable and meaningful result.</p>
          <p>A legitimate question at this point was:<br>
            "How does the Integrator delimit the information environment to be 
            considered?"</p>
          <p>At this initial phase only the resources that were known to the system 
            and that could be controlled were considered. This restriction was 
            established in order to test and validate the concepts and the methods 
            involved in the integration before considering its application in 
            a larger environment. </p>
          <p>In the future, when the Integrator is available in a more open environment, 
            a list of types of resources would be more effective than names. It 
            is difficult to control the length of the list and the names do not 
            always adequately describe the type of resource. <a name="GN7"><a href="#N7">[7]</a></a></p>
          <p>At this phase other types of active links were created and tested, 
            for example between the information item and the real object through 
            the <i>Guide to Canadian Museums and Galleries</i>. An information 
            item about an object from a museum was linked through the <i>"</i>Institution 
            Name<i>"</i> to the <i>Guide to Canadian Museums and Galleries, </i><a href="../http://www.chin.gc.ca/Museums/e_museums.html" target="_top">http://www.chin.gc.ca/Museums/e_museums.html</a>&gt; 
            which could lead the user to the respective museum's web site. The 
            artist's name was linked to the <i>Artists in Canada</i> database, 
            which is a resource under the coordination of the National Gallery 
            of Canada Library. An external authority resource, the <i>Union List 
            of Artist Names</i>, developed by the Getty Information Institute 
            was also made available &lt;<a href="../http://www.gii.getty.edu/ulan_browser/" target="_top">http://www.gii.getty.edu/ulan_browser/</a>&gt;. 
            Object type/name was linked to the terminology in <i>The</i> <i>Art 
            &amp; Architecture Thesaurus</i> developed by the Getty Information 
            Institute. <br>

          <p></A>Goals</U><br></B>
            The Integrator brought to light the following issues:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The user could still be faced with hundreds or sometimes thousands 
              of hits and would need further support to categorize the information 
              in order to be able to browse it efficiently. </li>
            <li>The context of the search was easily lost or became confusing. 
              A degree of ambiguity was present and there was no mechanism for 
              disambiguation. For example, a search for "spring" could result 
              in hits where spring was meant as a season, as a location, as a 
              proper name or an object.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Both issues are specific to large knowledge environments containing 
            complex information items. </p>
          <p>In the development of new access procedures, the focus of the Integrator 
            was next limited to the National Inventories, a collection of three 
            databases: Humanities, Natural Sciences and Archaeological Sites. 
          </p>
          <p>Limiting the focus was necessary due to the complexities of dealing 
            with approximately 25 million information items, in French and in 
            English, using diverse classification and terminology and, above all, 
            the connections they entail. </p>
          <p>Limiting the focus of the Integrator to a single resource also meant 
            a step forward in our general research on access redesign. This step 
            tested the integration concepts and methods on more detailed level. 
          </p>
          <p>The challenges now became: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How to make the National Inventories respond in a meaningful and 
              enjoyable way to a broad audience of museum professionals, researchers 
              and interested public, in French and in English, reconciling the 
              diversity of terminology and classification. </li>
            <li>How to create responses that challenge the user's understanding 
              of the domain and provide opportunities for reflection and interpretation. 
            </li>
            <li>How to transform the invitation of "Come and Get It" to an intellectual 
              adventure of "Seek and You Shall Find", where the skills and level 
              of interest determine the way the system organizes and formats the 
              answers. </li>
            <li>How to use the links and the connections embedded in the retrieved 
              information to place it into a context or follow a narrative path.</li>
          </ul><b><u>
          <p>What, When, Who, Where, and How</U><br></B>
            The Humanities database contains information describing objects, using 
            generic and/or specific terms to express underlying concepts, intended 
            to represent distinctions. Defining a concept means proposing a procedure 
            for explicitly expressing that distinction. The two basic dimensions 
            of distinctions are stability and generality. <a name="GN8"><a href="#N8">[8]</a></a> 
            It was found that the development of an effective access tool to the 
            Humanities database did not depend primarily on distinctions related 
            to stability, since the information items are not situations or events. 
            Distinctions related to generality issues, namely classes and objects, 
            are the keys for effective access and creative organization of the 
            retrieved material. The advantage of defining concepts was that semantic 
            categories could be constructed, assisting the user in the selection 
            and disambiguation of the results. "Spring" could be grouped under 
            "location" when signifying a place name and under "time" when signifying 
            a season, etc.</p>
          <p>The choice for concept mapping and categorization strategy considered 
            interaction, responsiveness, understanding multiple views, the ability 
            to encourage learning and discovery and even game-like framework issues. 
            A theoretical challenge, to be considered in the future, is the prototype 
            theory, where membership is determined by the similarity of the attributes 
            of an object to the category's prototype. Here, in contrast to the 
            classical view of categorization, where features are necessary for 
            deciding what belongs in what category, relationships are determined 
            by both intuition and logic. For example, in the category of games, 
            the only thing its members have in common is a vague family resemblance 
            as leisure pastimes. (Wittegenstein) <a name="GN9"><a href="#N9">[9]</a></a></p>
          <p>The problem, at this stage, is how to select concepts to form meaningful 
            categories, which could respond to the diverse usage situations the 
            access procedure must support. </p>
          <p>At this stage, the Concept Search model, developed by the Consortium 
            for the Interchange of Museum Information (CIMI), was used to define 
            the basic groupings of answers to the fundamental questions of What, 
            When, Who, Where, and How, as described and demonstrated in the Cultural 
            Heritage Information On Line Project <a name="GN10"><a name="GN14"><a href="#N10">[10]</a></a></a>. 
            During the CHIN design sessions, the names of these concepts were 
            debated and alternatives were proposed. It was decided to proceed 
            with What, When, Who, Where, and How, in the "Canadian Collections" 
            phase of the project, as broadly accepted basic concepts.</p><b><u>
          <p>The Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus</U> &lt;</B><a href="../http://www.gii.getty.edu/vocabulary/aat.html" target="_top">http://www.gii.getty.edu/vocabulary/aat.html</a>&gt;<b><br>
            </b>The integration of <i>The Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus</i> 
            with the Humanities database was one of the most significant improvements 
            to access and retrieval. The thesaurus, used as a behind-the-scenes 
            retrieval tool, enables access to objects through hierarchies. This 
            integration has permitted a conceptual structure, that embeds art 
            history knowledge, to be applied to the terminology used in the existing 
            information collections, without the need to modify the resource itself 
            or to impose vocabulary or category structures on those participating 
            in the construction of this collective resource. The architecture 
            enables the potential addition of other authorities and organized 
            information resources including geographical or temporal perspectives 
            or offering alternative views for categorization.</p>
          <p>To enable access in both French and English, a multilingual thesaurus 
            was developed using <i>The Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus</i> as 
            a base. The most frequently used terms in the Humanities database, 
            were identified and a French equivalent term was defined. Currently, 
            there are 2,600 French terms available and active during the retrieval 
            process. A searcher can enter the term <i>"painting", </i>for example, 
            and retrieve all the records containing the French equivalent "<i>peinture"</i>, 
            as well as records using the English term. This has significantly 
            improved full access to the bilingual resource, which contains data 
            in the language chosen by the contributing institution.</p><b><u>
          <p>Access</U><br></B>
            The redesign of access to the resource considered different usage 
            situations and habits, based on users' comments and requirements. 
            In defining the access scenarios the following were considered: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>frequency of usage (a first-time visitor or a frequent visitor), 
            </li>
            <li>different usage situations (work, enjoyment, information, incidental 
              access), </li>
            <li>level of knowledge of the field, understanding of the discipline 
            </li>
            <li>research and learning style (from concept to objects, from objects 
              to concepts, browsing, selecting) </li>
            <li>usage habits </li>
            <li>interaction style (preference for intelligent agents versus direct 
              manipulation <a name="GN15">controlled by the user <a name="GN11"><a href="#N11">[11]</a></a></a>).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The access scenarios that have been developed for "Canadian Collections" 
            are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Single Entry Search Box </li>
            <li>Browsing Access Points </li>
            <li>Concept Search </li>
            <li>Search Using a Form </li>
            <li>Search by Command </li>
            <li>Browsing Authorities: "Need assistance with a term?"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p><b>
          <p>The Single Entry Search Box </B>can work for everyone. It was designed 
            to bring the user a broad range of material in response to a query. 
            It is the place where the user can associate any combination of terms 
            with no restrictions imposed by the system. The system's immediate 
            response to the Single Entry Search Box command consists of the number 
            of objects retrieved, grouped according to the five main concepts 
            of What, When, Who, Where, and How. As stated above, this grouping 
            categorizes the answer into meaningful sets and renders a greater 
            degree of clarity to the response. The user can either start browsing 
            the information objects or, if the results are not satisfying, refine 
            or rephrase the query.</p><b>
          <p>Browsing Access Points </B>uses pre-defined queries, organized according 
            to the What, When, Who, Where, and How concepts. These are entry scenarios 
            developed and displayed by those who are actively involved in the 
            construction of the information environment. They are intended for 
            first-time visitors or non-specialists and are meant to be "quick" 
            access to interesting topics. The queries are not fixed and will be 
            updated periodically based on user response and usage patterns. </p>
          <p>The<b> Concept Search </b>is designed for those who wish to start 
            their search from one or more of the basic concepts of What, When, 
            Who, Where, and How. More control is provided for how the search is 
            performed, how terms are combined, and how results are delivered.</p>
          <p>The<b> Search Using a Form </b>opens with a pre-defined query form, 
            itemizing the most common fields for searching. A search assistant 
            is also available which provides, for each field, an alphabetic index 
            of all the available search terms along with the number of times the 
            term occurs in the resource as a whole. The terms from the index can 
            be cumulated to the form, reducing spelling errors. This search option 
            is designated for the more frequent users who can be more specific 
            in their queries. The responses are not categorized by the What, When, 
            Who, Where, and How concepts since the number of the hits is expected 
            to be lower because of the specific and targeted nature of the query.</p><b>
          <p>Search by Command </B>is provided for frequent users who are familiar 
            with the native command syntax of the underlying software. There has 
            been considerable pressure from CHIN's original member community to 
            provide this method which retains the power of the command line search 
            structures.</p><b>
          <p>Browsing by Authorities </B>enables users to perform searches starting 
            from a term or a concept. The user can search the thesaurus for a 
            specific term. The information about a term could include detailed 
            or family information, broader and narrower terms, alternate terms, 
            scope notes as well as a French equivalent. The hierarchies of the 
            thesaurus can be browsed by scrolling. When viewing the detailed term 
            definition the user can launch a query against the information resource, 
            which returns results categorized by the 5 concepts of What, When, 
            Who, Where, and How. The user can explore the objects representing 
            or illustrating the researched concept. The only authority which has 
            been integrated, at this time, is <i>The Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus</i>. 
            Other authorities, enabling the user to select different views into 
            the information environment and offering a mechanism to collect terms 
            from different authorities and then launch a combined query, will 
            be considered in the future. </p><b>
          <p>Refine </B>or<b> Rephrase </b>functions are considered key features 
            of the interface. As mentioned above, when dealing with large quantities 
            of information, the user requires a proper tool to enable regrouping 
            of the information in meaningful and useful ways. The user never has 
            to go "back" to refine a search. Having this function available encourages 
            a sense progress rather than failure.</p>
          <p>Each of the access scenarios is equipped with a "refine" option. 
            The Single Entry Search Box can be refined through interaction with 
            the system, which promptly responds to each new term added, providing 
            updated figures for the categorized results. Single Entry Search Box, 
            Concept Search, Browsing Access Points and Browsing Authorities, have 
            access to a refine option where terms can be added to the 5 concepts 
            of What, When, Who, Where and How. Each of these concepts can become 
            even more specific, efficiently reducing the scope of the search. 
            For example, if the user starts with "Thomson" and gets 5,000 hits 
            under "Who", the search can be narrowed to artists or manufacturers 
            or merchants named "Thomson". The user can use the same tool to broaden 
            the scope of the search. </p>
          <p>Providing these various search, retrieval and query refinement options 
            means that the user is in control. The level of interaction with the 
            system is determined by the type of query submitted. From children 
            working on school projects to those performing more sophisticated 
            research, each can select the level of interaction that is comfortable. 
            Users who just want to know what is in museum collections can use 
            the predefined searches and, when comfortable with that, start exploring 
            the resource on their own. The goal is to provide the user with options 
            based on interest and expertise.<br>

          <p></A>"Seek and You Shall Find", as a process, enables users to direct 
            their interaction with a knowledge environment - the "Information 
            Meta-Center". The goal of the CHIN Intellectual Access project has 
            been to develop a process which makes this happen and to enable the 
            user to explore the information resources on their own level based 
            on interest and expertise. With more frequent use, the level of expertise 
            and understanding of the knowledge environment will increase, which 
            will in turn enhance the perceived value of the resource.</p>
          <p>The initial goal was to focus on the information needs of the museum 
            professional, but it was rapidly determined that developing layered 
            access also opened the application to a much broader audience. From 
            the very simple search using the Single Entry Search Box or Browsing 
            by Access Points for the uninitiated, to the Search by Form or Search 
            by Command for those more intimately familiar with the knowledge environment, 
            it is anticipated that the spectrum of user perspectives into this 
            Meta-Center will be satisfied. </p>
          <p>Adopting the 5 concepts, which focus on the basic questions posed 
            by users, was a natural consequence of figuring out how best to synthesize 
            the volume of information into logical partitions which could be commonly 
            understood and effectively used. Allowing users to query, as well 
            as refine their searches on these concepts, was a logical extension. 
            Users can "seek" out the relevant information and, with assistance 
            from the conceptual structure, focus and refine the query to "find" 
            what is applicable to their need.</p>
          <p>The use of search assistants, such as subject specific thesauri and 
            multi-lingual thesauri, also greatly enhances access to the collective 
            resource. Superimposing a hierarchical vocabulary structure adds interpretive 
            knowledge to existing terminology in the Information Meta-Center.</p>
          <p>The focus up to this stage has been on developing search methodologies 
            and strategies on single information resources. Our next goal is to 
            extend these ideas to a group of resources, enabling the user to search 
            many related resources at one time - a more truly integrated search. 
            In addition, there is the need to synthesize results according to 
            the point of view of the user, such as distribution of results on 
            a time line, or geographically on a map. Enabling the selection of 
            that point of view gives the user a role on how results are presented 
            and subsequently used.</p>

            CHIN's mission is to: "Broker effective access to Canadian and international 
            heritage information for public education and enjoyment and for the 
            collective benefit of Canadian museums." <br>
            CHIN does this by working with the heritage community and others to:<br>
            1. Promote the creation, management, dissemination, and use of heritage 
            information; <br>
            2. Articulate and promote standards and guidelines which will enable 
            the creation and exchange of coherent information resources in a distributed 
            environment; <br>
            3. Offer integrated access to distributed heritage information; <br>
            4. Ensure the development and effective use of technology appropriate 
            to the specific needs of the community; <br>
            5. Represent Canadian museums in the development of national and international 
            initiatives and programs related to access to heritage information.

            Alexander Chislenko, Automated Collaborative Filtering and Semantic 
            Transports - (ACF) is an unprecedented technology for distribution 
            of opinions and ideas in society and facilitating contacts between 
            people with similar interests. It automates and enhances existing 
            mechanisms of knowledge distribution and dramatically increases their 
            speed and efficiency. This allows to optimize knowledge flow in the 
            society and accelerate the evolution of ideas in practically all subject 
            areas. ACF also provides a superior tool for information retrieval 
            systems that facilitates users' navigation in the sea of information 
            in a meaningful and personalized way. This technology can be viewed 
            as a semantic transport - a social utility that, after physical and 
            data transports, transfers increasingly abstract and intelligent objects 
            between previously isolated fragments of the social organism. &lt;<a href="../http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/ACF.html" target="_top">http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/ACF.html</a>&gt;<br>
