            <h2>1. Museums in an Interface Culture</h2>
            <blockquote> <a name="bearman_t"></a> <i>Museums once thought of themselves 
              as institutions to collect and preserve objects from around the 
              world, places for scientific study of their collections, and only 
              lastly as places to display the exotic to the public. Some have 
              referred to this period of display as the stack 'em deep, pile 'em 
              high philosophy of display. Over the years museums have changed 
              a great deal. Today, while museums are diverse, as are their aims, 
              it can safely be said that they are primarily in the business of 
              dissemination of information rather than artifacts. The advantage 
              to thinking in terms of information is that it validates the collection 
              of intangibles, such as oral histories, and replicas, as well as 
              actual artifacts; it places museums in a key position in an information 
              age; and it makes it easier to integrate traditional functions of 
              collection, preservation, research and display with the new watchwords, 
              education and communication. <br>
              </i>--David Bearman <a href="#bearman_f"><font size=2>(1)</font></a> 
            </blockquote>
            <p> Writing in 1992 about technology <i>in</i> museums, Bearman neatly 
              summarizes a profound shift in museums' perception of their mission, 
              which has only accelerated since then with the explosion of the 
              Internet and the World Wide Web . <br>
            <p> <a name="curatorial_problematics_t"></a> This shift has inevitably 
              placed stress on the curator's central role in the museum. Not that 
              they weren't already under fire on many fronts, from issues of omniscient 
              authority in a postmodern age of multiple meanings to accusations 
              of parsimonious gatekeeping to the challenges of communicating difficult 
              ideas and complex research to a &quot;general audience&quot; (which 
              usually means a lot of very different audiences with specific needs 
              and often-entrenched points of view). Regardless of how the curatorial 
              role is defined, however, the Net in particular and interface culture 
              in general introduce interesting and perhaps profound opportunities, 
              which might also be perceived as competitive pressures in the culture 
              arena. <a href="#curatorial_problematics_f"><font size=-1>(2)</font></a><br>
            <p> My experience these days (as opposed to just last year) working 
              with museums and new media is that while most personnel don't understand 
              how the Internet works--which seems perfectly reasonable--increasingly 
              they understand how it can work <i>for</i> them. Usually this is 
              as another avenue for education and communication. In this sense, 
              there is nothing particularly revolutionary about the Web. It's 
              a bit like direct marketing, only funner. It's like distance learning, 
              only via a computer instead of a camera. It's like publishing a 
              brochure or catalog, only you can still make changes after it's 
              &quot;printed.&quot; The echo of McLuhan here--we tend to understand 
              new media, initially, in terms of our understanding of old media--is 
              familiar and entirely appropriate.<br>
            <p> I am interested in at least considering whether and how digital 
              culture may affect museum culture in unexpected--and perhaps "unreasonable"--ways. 
              Steven Johnson writes toward the end of <a name="johnson_t"><i>Interface 
              Culture:</i></a> 
            <blockquote> <i>The most profound change ushered in by the digital 
              revolution will not involve bells and whistles or new programming 
              tricks. . . . The most profound change will lie with our </i>generic 
              <i>expectations about the interface itself. We will come to think 
              of interface design as a kind of art form--perhaps </i>the <i>art 
              form of the next century. And with that broader shift will come 
              hundreds of corollary effects, effects that trickle down into a 
              broad cross section of everyday life, <b>altering our storytelling 
              appetites, our sense of physical space, our taste in music, the 
              design of our cities </b></i>[emphasis added]. <a href="#johnson_f"><font size=2>(3)</font></a> 
              <br>
            </blockquote>
            <p> <a name="beyond_t"></a> I am skeptical of interface becoming the 
              new art form for a century, but I do find plausible that our understanding 
              of interface will expand dramatically and impact directly on creative 
              expression, which is why, in this paper I look primarily, although 
              not exclusively, at examples of the intersection of museums with 
              the Web in the arts. I believe that contemporary artists and &quot;interfacers&quot; 
              (Johnson) have much to teach us about the relevant possibilities 
              of a new medium in a changing society.

            <h3>Virtual Tours & Augmented Museum Exhibitions</h3>
            <p> Skipping right over the &quot;brochure-ware&quot; era of museum 
              Web sites, museums quickly realized the possibility of putting their 
              exhibitions online, often augmenting the efforts with richer information 
              that might not be available at the exhibition. <br>
            <p> <a href="#whc_l"><img src="images/whc.jpg" width="450" height="311" border="0" alt="White House Crafts, NMAA"></a> 
              <br>
              <a href="#whc_l"><i><font size=1>The White House Collection of American 
              Crafts</font></i></a><font size=1>, National Museum of American 
              Art<br>
              </font> 
            <p> <a name="whc_t">For instance, the Smithsonian's first online exhibition 
              was &quot;</a><a href="#whc_l">The White House Collection of American 
              Crafts</a>,&quot; presented and produced by the National Museum 
              of American Art. This exhibition included extensive video and audio 
              clips of the curator talking about selected pieces and handling 
              them in ways that would not be possible during the exhibition. In 
              addition, each artist was asked to answer a series of questions 
              about their work, which was not part of the exhibition itself.<a href="#whc_f"><font size=-1>(4)</font></a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              <a name="alternating_t"></a> Another, more up-to-date example of 
              the basic online tour of a museum exhibition is the San Jose Museum 
              of Art's fine implementation of <a href="#alternating_l"><i>Alternating 
              Currents</i></a> . This site makes clear how the increasing sophistication 
              of the HTML specification allows for much greater control of the 
              design and layout of Web pages. Note that the online versions of 
              both The White House Collection of American Crafts and Alternating 
              Currents are referred to as <i>tours</i>, an important semantic 
              difference that attempts to clarify and keep separate the notion 
              that online presentations are not meant as substitutions for the 
              exhibitions.<br>
              <br>

            <h3>You Are There: The Immersive Interface</h3>
            <a name="nga_t"></a> <a href="#nga_l"></a> <a href="#andersen_l"><img align=Left src="images/andersen.jpg" width="318" height="250" border="0"></a>
            <p> Another approach besides exhibition &quot;augmentation&quot; that 
              museums have attempted on the Web is a &quot;you-are-there,&quot; 
              more immersive interface using QTVR (e.g. Walker Art Center's <a href="#andersen_l"><i>Andersen 
              Window Gallery</i></a>), RealSpace (e.g. National Gallery of Art's 
              <a href="#nga_l"><i>Thomas Moran</i></a> or VRML (e.g. The Natural 
              History Museum's <a href="#endeavour_l"><i>The Virtual Endeavour</i></a>). 
              Interestingly, there is some preliminary evidence from the Virtual 
              Endeavour experiment that younger visitors prefer the greater interactivity 
              and control of navigation allowed by an immersive interface. <a href="#immersive_f"><font size=-1>(5)</font></a> 
              If this proves true, it may become a significant reason for museums 
              to experiment with innovative interfaces. Currently, such efforts 
              are often considered simply &quot;bells and whistles,&quot; which, 
              if anything, complicate rather than enhance communication.<br>
              <br>
              <a name="vr_t"></a> <i>The Virtual Endeavour</i> actually had a 
              networked VR component to it. Other institutions such as Ars Electronica 
              in Linz and ZKM in Karlsruhe are looking at fully immersive environmnets, 
              which could also be networked, as is demonstrated by the <i>NICE</i> 
              program at the Electronic Visualization Lab at the University of 
              Illinois. <a href="#vr_f"><font size=-1>(6)</font></a>

            <h3>The Extended Exhibition</h3>
            Finally, in terms of online tours of museum exhibitions, besides augmenting 
            the exhibition and presenting an immersive interface, there is also 
            the option of <i>extending</i> the exhibition. Like the best exhibition 
            publications, extending an exhibition online means more than simply 
            re-presenting it but also reformatting it for the best possible experience 
            in the medium--in front of a computer screen, transmitted via the 
            Internet. <br>
            <br>
            <a name="thater_t"></a><a href="#thater_l"><img align=Right src="images/thater.gif" width="231" height="158" border="0" alt="Diana Thater"></a> 
            One example of extending the exhibition is <a href="#thater_l"><i>Diana 
            Thater: Orchids in the Land of Technology</i></a>. The online version 
            was &quot;announced&quot; by an automated series of pages, which reprised 
            one of Thater's video works, which appeared as a &quot;tunnel&quot; 
            to the entrance to the Walker home page.<a href="#thater_f"><font size=2>(7)</font></a> 
            Clicking on it dumped the viewer in front of a scrolling quote by 
            Walter Benjamin, which was also based on a &quot;wall label&quot; 
            displayed on a TV monitor at the beginning of the site-exhibition. 
            The viewer can then &quot;wander&quot; through QTVR galleries, where 
            many of the depicted objects are "hot." While wandering, it is possible 
            to listen to audio snippets taken from an opening day dialogue with 
            the artist. But it is here that the designer, Louis Mazza, extends 
            the experience by re-mixing the audio in a way that calls attention 
            to the mix, just as Thater's &quot;mixing&quot; of the rgb channels 
            of the video projector calls attention to the technological and constructed 
            underpinnings of the normally transparent, narrative experience. It's 
            a fine line between presenting the work in an exhibition and extending 
            it appropriately--appropriate to both the work and the medium. 
            <h3><a name="designed_2b_t">Exhibitions Designed to be Online </a></h3>
            <p> Increasingly, exhibitions are designed to be at least partially 
              online. That is, from the earliest conception for an exhibition, 
              an integrated online component is planned. Primarily, these involve 
              site-based exhibitions, but this is also changing, as we shall see. 
            <p> Just a few <a href="#designed_2b_l">examples include:</a> <i>Arts 
              As Signal: Inside the Loop</i>, <i>Bodies Incorporated</i>, <i>Mixing 
              Messages: Graphic Design in Contemporary Culture</i>, and <i>Techno 
              Seduction</i>. 
            <p> One of the most radical online exhibitions is the Smithsonian's 
              <i>Revealing Things</i> curated by Judy Gradwahl. Based on &quot;everyday 
              objects&quot; in the collection of the National Museum of Natural 
              History, there is no physical installation related to this effort, 
              on which Gradwahl devoted over two years. It is not clear whether 
              in the long run, entirely virtual exhibitions of physical objects 
              will become a common practice--some would say that the authentic 
              object is just about the only thing separating museums from all 
              other online curatorial practices--but regardless, it is an important 
              benchmark. The site also uses an innovative interface based on <a href="#plumb_t">Plumb 
              Design's Thinkmap</a>.
            <p> 
            <h3><a name="filter">The Curator As Filter</a></h3>
            <p> No matter which way you slice it, of course, putting some version 
              of an exhibition online is not the same as curating on the Web. 
              Here museums to date have been more circumspect, but there are several 
              fruitful directions that have been tried. At the present time, the 
              museum community is expending a great deal of effort simply digitizing 
              its resources and making them increasingly accessible online. Digitizing 
              assets is not dissimilar to the historical function of the museum 
              to preserve artifacts. As this process becomes more and more successful, 
              however, there will be an increasing need to find ways to &quot;filter&quot; 
              the vast quantities of information that are available. The emphasis 
              will shift from simply &quot;creating&quot; content to presenting 
              a context for it; a point of view about it--just as one of the roles 
              of the curator is to identify, contextualize, and present a point 
              of view about works of art. While lots of museum Web sites have 
              lists of links, few tend to &quot;curate&quot; these links or offer 
              much reason for listing them beyond a generic &quot;sites to check 
              out.&quot; 
            <p> <a name="filter_t">The </a><a href="#whitney_l">Whitney Web site</a>, 
              for instance, states, &quot;From this location, we offer a link 
              to other museum sites, where some of the most interesting online 
              delivery of museum content is occurring. Inclusion in this list 
              does not constitute an endorsement by the Whitney Museum, nor is 
              this list by any means comprehensive.&quot; And while this may be 
              more explicit than most, it is not uncommon. <a href="#montreal_l">The 
              Musee d'art contemporain de Montreal</a> has one of the most organized 
              and comprehensive listings of contemporary art on the Web, but they 
              too don't provide much contextualization for the links. The <a href="#cac">Cincinnati 
              Contemporary Arts Center</a> states, &quot;We're interested in exploring 
              the Web as a &quot;new medium&quot; for artists and are planning 
              to develop this Virtual Exhibitions page to do just that. In the 
              interim, here are links to various sites that use cyberspace as 
              art space.&quot; And they do provide contextual information about 
              the links. Interestingly, a science museum, the <a href="#exploratorium_l">Exploratorium,</a> 
              lists a weekly &quot;ten cool sites,&quot; many of which are often 
              art sites. The National Museum of American Art's photography online 
              site, <a href="#transmissions_l">Helios</a>, also reviews photography 
              web resources every two weeks in &quot;<a href="#transmissions_l">Transmissions</a>.&quot;

            <h3><a name="hyperessay">Curating the Web: Maps &amp; Hyperessays 
              </a></h3>
            <p> The closest parallel to a &quot;curated&quot; list of Web links 
              may be the annotated bibliography. Once, however, we delve outside 
              of the museum's collection (on the Web), even in a bibliographic 
              way, the conceptual floodgates open to curating the Web itself, 
              so to speak. Of course, exhibitions from outside the collection 
              are nothing new, but it is still not widely practiced on the Net. 
              There are, however, some intriguing examples. 
            <p> <a name="curatours_t">The Institute for Contemporary Art in London 
              has what it calls &quot;</a><a href="#curatours_l">Curatours</a>,&quot; 
              which &quot;explore ideas and themes across web sites. Each Curatour 
              explores a different theme and is curated by a specialist within 
              the field.&quot; To date there are only two curatours and they are 
              approaching a year old, so it is not clear whether ICA intends to 
              continue the program. Artist Jake Tilson's <i>Colour-Color</i> &quot;focuses 
              upon the use of colour on the Internet from symbolism and theoretical 
              issues to the effects it creates.&quot; The other curatour, <i>Collapse</i> 
              is actually less a Web tour than the idea of using a different interface--in 
              this case VRML--to explore the ICA Web site from a different vantage 
              point, so to speak.

              <a name="cyberatlas_t">The Guggenheim Museum has a similar program, 
              which it calls &quot;</a><a href="#cyberatlas_l">CyberAtlas</a>,&quot; 
            <blockquote><i>a concerted effort to chart this terra incognita [of

              a series of maps of cyberspace, with a particular focus on sites 
              related to visual art and culture. Unlike the typical navigational 
              chart, the maps in CyberAtlas can take you where you want to go 
              as well as tell you how to get there: clicking on a Web site in 
              any of the maps will transport you immediately to the corresponding 
              page on the Internet.&quot;</i></blockquote>
            Its first two projects are <i>Electric Sky</i> by Jon Ippolito--&quot;Bright 
            stars in the firmament of online art and the networks that support 
            them--and <i>Intelligent Life</i> by Laura Trippi--&quot;A thematic 
            map that traces connections between recent scientific developments 
            and art, theory, and popular culture.&quot; These are wonderful, must-see 
            works, which point to an important direction in curating (on) the 
            Web. 
            <p> <a name="beuys_t">As a variant of the Web map, the Walker Art 
              Center commissioned a &quot;</a><a href="#beuys_l">hyperessay</a>&quot; 
              based on the life and work of Joseph Beuys. The occasion was an 
              exhibition of his work, but the goal was to write an informational 
              text that could not only be read in a non-linear manner, but would 
              also be designed to take advantage of the vast resources of the 
              Internet by linking out to them whenever appropriate. If the World 
              Wide Web is a prototype of Bush's <i>Memex</i> or Nelson's <i>Xanadu</i>, 
              then we should be able to construct programming that takes advantage 
              of this &quot;universal library.&quot; <a href="#memex_f"><font size=-1>(8)</font></a> 
              The Walker plans to commission at least three hyperessays a year 
              on broad themes that relate to on-site programming.

            <h3><a name="web_art">Curating Web Art </a></h3>
            <p> Annotating links, mapping territory, navigating a route, are all 
              curatorial-like functions operating on digital objects and/or in 
              a digital domain. Perhaps the clearest expression of this kind of 
              effort is curating Web-specific art. While technology, including 
              the Web, has been making its way into the gallery for the past 30 
              years or more, there appears to be little consensus in the museum 
              community about the definition or even the value of Web-specific 
              art. 
            <p> <a name="installation_t">Many artists have incorporated the Internet 
              as an aspect of their physical installations in museums: Shu Lea 
              Cheang's </a><a href="#bowling_l"><i>Bowling Alley</i></a> originally

              the Museum of Modern Art, to name just two, but museums' embrace 
              of Web-specific art has been more cautious to date. 
            <p> <a name="ucr_t">Two of the earliest pioneers, it is interesting

              that have significant Web components for several years. They even 
              acquired a copy of the software program Adobe Photoshop for their 
              permanent collection because of its importance to the future history 
              of imaging. <a href="#A__art">@art</a>, one of whose founders, Joseph

              Dia's artists' projects</a> for the web began in late 1994 when 
              Michael Govan became the Director of Dia. His enthusiastic support 
              for the web had two goals: to make information about Dia and its 
              programs accessible to a wide audience; and, more importantly, to 
              commission art works made specifically for the web. Since its inception, 
              Dia has defined itself as a vehicle for the realization of extraordinary 
              artists' projects that might not otherwise be supported by more 
              conventional institutions. To this end it has always sought to facilitate 
              direct and unmediated experiences between the audience and the art-work. 
              The web provided an opportunity to bring art directly to the public 
              by commissioning significant projects with artists who are interested 
              in exploring the aesthetic and conceptual potentials of this new 
              medium.
              <p> Dia's Curator, Lynne Cooke, selects the artists with whom Dia 
                plans to work in consultation with Sara Tucker, Director of Digital 
                Media. On the basis of our extensive and ongoing research in contemporary 
                art practice, we follow the work of many artists, both in the 
                United States and abroad, ranging from the young and unknown to 
                the acclaimed and established. We choose artists mostly from the 
                fine arts but also from adjacent disciplines, including dance 
                and architecture, based on our conviction that they will approach 
                the medium in a thoughtful, even unorthodox way. The artists bring 
                the set of issues and questions that they address in their work 
                in other media to the web, formulating projects which further 
                their own ideas while addressing the context and characteristics 
                of the web.
              <p> There are no formal rules or guidelines for these projects - 
                the production process usually varies greatly from project to 
                project. Sara Tucker works closely with the artist to realize 
                the project in optimal terms. Decisions about what bandwidth or 
                browser to design to are left to the artist after they have understood 
                the various tradeoffs. While there have been a few exceptions, 
                most of the artists have not had programming skills: the working 
                process involves first exploring potentials and limits, then the 
                artist works closely with Tucker to design and program the projects.
              <p> Multimedia and electronics are not new to the visual arts. Dia, 
                for example, sponsored the multimedia installations by such artists 
                as La Monte Young and Robert Whitman in the early 1970s. Digital 
                media, however, have become increasingly important in the visual 
                arts as advances in computer and communications technologies have 
                enabled artists to easily manipulate images, text, and sound, 
                and to imagine distributing their work to the enormous audience 
                suggested by the exponential growth of the Internet. Given that 
                the historical development of any new media, such as film or photography, 
                was led by artists, it is our hope that Dia, by implementing artists' 
                projects in the realm of digital media, can extend the boundaries 
                of this medium, and challenge the reigning presuppositions that 
                govern it.
              <p> The overall goal of this program of artists' projects for the 
                web is to commission a series of diverse, challenging, and intriguing 
                projects.</I> <a href="#dia_f"><font size=2>(9)</font></a>

            <h2><a name="competition">3. Cultural Competition </a></h2>
            <p> When Disney proposed a historic theme park partially on the site 
              of a Civil War battlefield in Virginia, there was much hue and cry--and 
              only part of it came from the nearby landed gentry concerned about 
              its impact on their fox hunting. There was equal concern about the 
              &quot;Disneyfication&quot; of history and how could a <i>real</i> 
              museum like the nearby Smithsonian compete with such &quot;edutainment.&quot; 
              In fact, it is commonplace to bemoan the task of museums who must 
              <i>compete</i> with the various juggernauts of popular entertainment, 
              whether they be Niketown or Disney or <i>Amistad</i>. 
            <p> Without downplaying--or wanting to get into, here--issues of authentic 
              and inauthentic experiences in a mediated culture, from my perspective, 
              forget competing with the artistic vision of a Steven Spielberg 
              or James Cameron, we museums are hardly keeping in sight of let 
              alone abreast of the more modest efforts of artists and artist organizations 
              <i>working the Web</i> today. 
            <p> <a name="becomes_t">In January of 1997 I was asked by the AAM 
              publication, <i>Museum News</i>, to </a><a href="#becomes_l">write 
              about the best museum Web sites.</a> I ended up suggesting that 
              a non-museum, artnetweb, had the best museum Web site. The museum 
              Web environment is an order of magnitude richer a year later, but 
              I'm still not convinced that the best museum Web sites are being 
              produced by brick-and-mortar museums with collections of artworks. 
            <h3><a name="virtual_museums">Virtual Museums </a></h3>
            <p> <a name="louvre_t">Just as in &quot;real life,&quot; where the 
              Louvre is one of the most renowned museums in the world, </a><a href="#louvre_l"><i>Le 
              WebLouvre</i></a> is one of the best known, most visited, and most 
              often linked Web sites in cyberspace. Only <i>Le WebLouvre</i> is 
              a virtual museum. It has no collection and is not officially related 
              to the Louvre (it is now formally called <i>Le WebMuseum</i> after 
              a "conversation" with the Louvre's lawyers). 
            <blockquote> <i>Part of the ENST (Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications, 
              Paris) World Wide Web server, Le WebLouvre - no official relation 
              to the famous art museum - was created by Nicolas Pioch, a 23-year-old 
              student and computer science instructor at the ENST. The project 
              is continually being developed and expanded with the help of outside 
              contributors because &quot;more artistic stuff is needed on the 
              Internet,&quot; as Pioch explains.</i><a href="#louvre_f"><font size=2>(12)</font></a> 
            </blockquote>
            <p> There are other examples of virtual museums that either &quot;borrow&quot; 
              the collections of other museums or model themselves on a museum, 
              but I am more interested in the incredibly wide range of &quot;institutions&quot; 
              that do many of the things that museums should consider doing more 
              of, without needing to define themselves <i>qua</i> museums. What 
              is the point, after all, if the collection is either virtual (i.e. 
              non-existent) or digital, in which case it is infinitely and exactly 
              replicable and the issue of ownership is not as central as other 
              kinds of issues, such as point of view, context, innovation, support 
              of artistic practice, and much more? 
            <h3><a name="virtual_arts_orgs">Virtual Arts Organizations </a></h3>
            <a href="#virtual_orgs_l"><img align=Left src="images/adabase2.gif" width="300" height="180" border="0" alt="adaweb"></a> 
            <p> <a name="virtual_orgs_t"></a> There are probably hundreds of virtual 
              organizations even in the delimited realm of contemporary art. An 
              <a href="#virtual_orgs_l">inadequate list</a> of some of the more 
              outstanding would include: adaweb, Digital XXX, irational.org, Stadium, 
              The Thing, Turbulence, Year Zero One, and ZoneZero. A list of the 
              artists and projects represented by just these sites, however, would 
              constitute a significant &quot;collection.&quot; [Before you groan 
              about all the great sites missing, read on, many more are discussed 
              below in different contexts.] What's more, the commitment of each 
              of these sites to a critical context, education, innovative interface, 
              community building, and yes, curatorial selection, is impressive 
              and inspiring. 
            <p> The interesting question is not how do these sites match up with 
              museum sites or as virtual museums, but rather, what do traditional 
              museums have that these sites don't or couldn't? 
            <p> Before exploring this question, however, I'd like to detail some 
              of the other &quot;competition&quot; that museums face. In the &quot;atomic 
              world,&quot; it is difficult for an arts magazine, for instance, 
              to compete directly with a museum. A &quot;project&quot; on the 
              pages is seldom comparable to an installation in the galleries. 
              In the digital realm, however, the virtual gallery of a zine is 
              potentially just as effective as the virtual gallery of a museum--both 
              can provide the same amount of hard drive space, of cyberspace, 
              of color space, of coding capability. Again, so what is the difference? 
            <h3><a name="zine_galleries_t">Zine Galleries </a></h3>
            <p> It may be true that every graduate art department and 50% of the 
              undergraduate departments around the world are starting online zines. 
              And many of them are very good. Nor is academia the only source 
              of zines. But wherever they come from, most that deal with art and 
              visual culture in any significant way, &quot;curate&quot; digital 
              galleries of online artworks. A <a href="#zine_galleries_l">short 
              and again inadequate list</a> might include Hotwired's rgb gallery, 
              Leonardo Electronic Almanac, Speed, Switch from the CADRE Institute 
              at San Jose State University, Talk Back!, Why Not Sneeze? and many 
              others. 
            <blockquote> <a href="#zine_galleries_l"><img align=Left src="images/disalvo.gif" width="75" height="65" border="0" alt="Carl DiSalvo, LEA"></a> 
              <a name="lea_t"></a> <i>While conceiving on the redesign of the 
              Leonardo Electronic Almanac Gallery, I felt the need to take a few 
              steps back in order to move forward. The world wide web is rife 
              with &quot;virtual galleries,&quot; the majority of these are simply 
              links to work or personal homepages. Though occasionally interesting, 
              these sites present more a collection of portfolios than what one 
              would expect under the guise of a 'gallery'. With the LEA Gallery 
              I wanted to sustain some aspects of the traditional gallery -- the 
              curatorial presence, themes, and a sense of place in a larger history 
              than that of the world wide web. <br>
              <br>
              The LEA gallery is conceived to be ever-changing -- adapting itself 
              in both design and function to complement new projects as well as 
              offering a framework for the archiving of older works. While the 
              Leonardo Electronic Almanac itself is designed to accommodate a 
              wide variety of users -- those on the bleeding edge of technology 
              as well as those relying on dial-in modems and older browser -- 
              the LEA gallery has been designed to take advantage of some of the 
              newer technological developments. As the gallery evolves and adapts, 
              so will the technology it uses, and by keeping the gallery open 
              to technological exploration, it creates the possibility for projects 
              investigating and utilizing animation, sound, VRML and Java. <br>
              <br>
              The future of the gallery includes the presentation of new works 
              exploring the boundaries of art, science and technology, topical 
              works dealing with themes explored in the monthly issues of the 
              Almanac, artistic homages to media pioneers, and works that illuminate 
              contemporary theories in the arts and sciences.</i>--Patrick Maun,

            As the programmer for Walker's Gallery 9, I could--and do--identify 
            many of the same goals. How are we diferent?
            <p> <a name="feast_t"></a> 
            <h3>A Moveable Feast</h3>
            One of the best known sites for new media did not even have a permanent 
            public home until last year. However, <a href="#feast_l">Ars Electronica's</a> 
            "Festival of Art, Technology and Society" has been a significant force 
            for almost 20 years and in recent years has had extensive Web presence. 
            Similarly, the annunal conference for the <a href="#feast_l">International 
            Society for Electronic Arts</a> (ISEA) hosts a Web site with a juried 
            set of links to artists' work. The venerable <a href="#feast_l">SIGGRAPH</a> 
            conference has an online art gallery. Even the most recent Documenta 
            curated a Web site separate from its physical installations. And for 
            this year's Museums and the Web conference, there is an online exhibition 
            of net art.
            <p> Some of the most significant effort in terms of identifying and 
              contextualizing net art is being done on an annual basis at festivals 
              and conferences around the world. And while a CU-SeeMe connection 
              or http click may not be the same thing as sipping espresso at a 
              sidewalk cafe in Paris, it is truly a networked feast that allows 
              for some of the same "branding" advantages of sited museums.
            <p> 
            <h3><a name="design_t">Designing Art </a></h3>
            <p> In the digital realm, it seems as if it is not enough for design 
              studios to have a few prestigious accounts, such as museum Web sites. 
              Many of the major agencies create their own &quot;art&quot; Web 
              sites--semi-autonomous efforts that are seen as both a creative 
              outlet and a kind of research effort for cutting edge design. 
            <p> For example, Agency.com has <a href="#design_l"><i>Urban Desires</i></a>, 
              a heretofore zine-format effort that is in the process of changing 
              but whose goals are perhaps even more directly about creating cultural 
              content: &quot;...we will create a venue for the distribution of 
              new-school new media: highly visual pieces, not so linear storytelling, 
              interactive explorations, short films, animations, games, experiments, 
              media hoaxes.... and who knows what else.&quot;<a href="#urban_f"><font size=2>(14)</font></a>. 
              Razorfish has two efforts.<a href="#design_l"><i>The Blue Dot</i></a> 
              "curated" by Craig M. Kanarick, which takes as its challenge to 
              &quot;prove that the Web can be beautiful,&quot; and rsub, the goal 
              of which is to &quot;create an online network of original content 
              just when everyone else has given up.&quot; 
            <p> <a name="plumb_t"></a> Beyond the (con)fusion of design houses 
              creating original content/art, the interface itself, as has been 
              discussed, is an important art form (e.g. <a href="#sfmoma_t">SFMOMA 
              collecting Web site design</a>). One particularly interesting interface, 
              Plumb Design's <a href="#design_l">Thinkmap</a>/Visual Thesaurus, 
              was actually a spin-off of Razorfish's rsub, and is the main interface 
              for the Smithsonian exhibition, <a href="#design_l"><i>Revealing 
              Things</i></a> mentioned earlier.
            <p> <a name="ecommerce_t"></a> 
            <h3>e-Commercial Galleries</h3>
            Commercial galleries throughout the history of modern art have been 
            among the most prescient in recognizing new art forms. Perhaps given 
            the ease of replicability of much net art coupled with an anti "product" 
            attitude on the part of many practising net artists, there still is 
            not widespread activity on the net by commercial galleries, but <a href="#ecommerce_l">some 
            significant efforts do exist</a>, such as the Sandra Gering Gallery, 
            Postmasters. There are also other interesting outlets, such as the 
            <a href="#ecommerce_l">Robert J. Schiffler Foundation</a>.
            <p> 
            <h3><a name="libarchive_t">Libraries &amp; Archives </a></h3>
            <p> <a name="quality_t"></a> Normally, we think of libraries and archives 
              as complements to museums, which they certainly are, of course (and 
              vice versa). At the same time, to the extent that museums are &quot;primarily 
              in the business of dissemination of information,&quot; there is 
              overlap. In the short run, librarians' efforts to identify quality 
              sources of information should point them toward museum resources, 
              if we do our jobs well.<a href="#quality_f"><font size=2>(15)</font></a> 
              In the long run, however, decisions about what &quot;stuff&quot; 
              to archive--including, for example, art Web sites--is tantamount 
              to a curatorial decision. Except not only might curators not be 
              making these decisions, they may not be made directly by any human 
              at all. 
            <p> <a name="lesk_t">In his fascinating paper for the </a><a href="#time_l">Time 
              &amp; Bits conference</a>, Michael Lesk debunks the notion that 
              it will be physically impossible to store the sum of human knowledge 
              but suggests an even greater problematic--how to evaluate it. 
            <blockquote> <i>There will be enough disk space and tape storage in 
              the world to store everything people write, say, perform or photograph. 
              For writing this is true already; for the others it is only a year 
              or two away. Only a tiny fraction of this information has been professionally 
              approved, and only a tiny fraction of it will be remembered by anyone. 
              As noted before the storage media will outrun our ability to create 
              things to put on them; and so after the year 2000 the average disk 
              drive or communications link will contain machine-to-machine communication, 
              not human-to-human. When we reach a world in which the average piece 
              of information is never looked at by a human, we will need to know 
              how to evaluate everything automatically to decide what should get 
              the precious resource of human attention.</i><a href="#lesk_f"><font size=2>(16)</font></a>

            Standards, Dewey decimals, archives, longevity. These are not sexy 
            topics, but unless we pay attention, history may end up being understood

              have shown incredible interest and enthusiasm in the collaborative 
              process, and exposed really interesting takes on what the Web can 
              be used for, how it would change the way we communicate, how it

            <p> Not only are many artists engaging the Web with innovative work, 
              but some are also problematizing the potential role of museums and 
              other institutional spaces/collections vis-a-vis the Web in challenging 
              ways. The obvious issue that comes to mind is the Internet's &quot;many-to-many&quot; 
              structure and what has been called &quot;disintermediation.&quot; 
              In other words, through the Internet, an artist almost anywhere 
              in the world can reach anyone almost anywhere else who has an Internet 
              connection. without having to go through the a &quot;middleman,&quot; 
              such as a gallery or museum. 
            <p> <a name="net_art_t">One of the better-known efforts in this regard--and 
              more mysterious in many ways--is a loose confederation of artists,

              and the Web site <a href="#net_art_l">irational.org</a> as well 
              as several others. Suffice it to say that the nettime archive and 
              irational.org are worth spending a great deal of time reading and 
              clicking through but that the artists and theorists associated with 
              net.art self-consciously problematize issues of curation and institutionalization 
              at the same time that they practice forms of it.

              system, etc. I think it's not possible at all, especially on the 
              net, because of the hyperlink system. Whatever you do it can be

            <p> <a name="mailart_t">There is nothing revolutionary, of course, 
              about art projects that invite open participation according to a 
              prescribed format. Many artists have done this over the years, such 
              as Lew Thomas's important work with photography in the early 70s. 
              There also parallels with mail artists, who &quot;as practitioners 
              of an international art movement treat the distribution system as 
              integral to their medium.&quot; And Group Material describes their 
              process this way:</a> 
            <blockquote> <i>Our working method might best be described as painfully 
              democratic, because so much of our process depends on the review, 
              selection, and critical juxtaposition of innumerable cultural objects, 
              adhering to a collective process is extremely time-consuming and 
              difficult. However, the shared learning and ideas produce results 
              that are often inaccessible to those who work alone.</i> <a href="#mailart_f"><font size=2>(18)</font></a> 
            </blockquote>
            <p> The Internet, however, is perhaps a uniquely fluid and supportive 
              medium for such projects--in terms of putting out the call, in terms 
              of the ease of creating the work, in terms of contributing the work, 
              and in especially in terms of displaying the work (despite the possibility 
              of a gallery installation of <i>Desktop IS</i>, it lives perfectly 
              comfortably on the Net). Perhaps most importantly, however, as the 
              Net becomes increasingly ubiquitous, the designed interface becomes 
              concomitantly central to our lives, and it is important to question 
              and investigate it as something that is indeed constructed and not 
              &quot;natural,&quot; as we have come to unconsciously think of the 
              desktop--if we think of it at all.

              was specifically extended to the Web in order to invoke the collaboration 
              of people from around the world. 
            <blockquote> <i>The File Room ... documents numerous individual cases

              view, or banned since the beginning of history. This project intends

              visible. Although, as an ironic and tragic footnote, with the closing

              that,&quot; the net equivalent may be a smart agent knowing before 
              you do what book or music CD or artwork you are going to like and 
              linking you to it. The artist team Komar and Melamid have taken 
              this a step further by creating paintings based on &quot;scientifically

              professional marketing firm, a survey was conducted to determine 
              what Americans prefer in a painting; the results were used to create 
              the painting America's Most Wanted. This project was expanded in

              dozen countries, analyze the survey data, and participate directly

            <p> While Komar and Melamid do not go so far as to &quot;mass customize&quot; 
              their offerings--they are more interested in the mean and the norm--the

              the much-vaunted two-way communication of the Net. Not only can 
              viewers tell the artists what they think, they can even directly 
              influence what they create. 
            <p> Paul Vanouse takes this a step further with his <a href="#A"><i>Persistent 
              Data Confidante</i></a> project. With <i>PDC</i>, visitors tell 
              a secret (of at least 10 words) and then are told a secret, which 
              they rate (Vanouse says cu-rate) on a scale of 1 to 10. Over time, 
              as secrets receive more ratings, they are in turn algorithmically 
              rated as to suitability for &quot;reproduction&quot;. Eventually, 
              the highest rated secrets mate and are fused to create a &quot;new&quot; 
              secret. Curating as Darwinian selection? Participants get to chose/curate 
              their favorites, yes, but the results of their choices are unknowable--in 
              a not dissimilar way from not knowing how Komar &amp; Melamid's 
              paintings will ultimately turn out.

            <h3><a name="artist_museum_t">The Artist As Museum </a></h3>
            <p> From Andrew Wyeth to Any Warhol, it is nothing new to have a museum 
              devoted to a single artist, even while the artist is alive. It is 
              somewhat less usual for the artist to be architect, director, exhibit 
              designer, publications and pr manager, registrar, educator, and, 
              oh yes, the artist. But there are a number of such edifices on the 
              Internet that playfully mimic the traditional structures of the 
              museums in the zero g of cyberspace. The <a href="#artist_museum_l">Lin 
              Hsin Hsin Art Museum</a> is perhaps the most energetic example around, 
              complete with souvenir shop, cafe, a musical toilet, and much, much 
              more. Become a member now! and received discounted admissions to 
              . . . 
            <p> The Hsin Hsin Museum is a bit like the roasting of a famous person. 
              One can speak the truth by clothing it in excess. Whether or not 
              it is tongue-in-cheek, Hsin Hsin's museum skewers The Museum by 
              so faithfully and lovingly recreating its forms without worrying 
              too much about its meanings. And this is a not inaccurate description 
              of the first couple of waves of museum Web sites. We knew the form, 
              and we managed some jazzy technology, but is that the experience 
              we want to have on the Web? 
            <p> Robbin Murphy's <a href="#artist_museum_l"><i>Project Tumbleweed</i></a>, 
              however, is a bit like visiting a large museum where lots is going 
              on and the signage really only makes sense after you've been there 
              a few times and are starting to become comfortable with things. 
              To the first time visitor it can be a bit disorienting, but it's 
              clear there's something there. Murphy, a co-founder of artnetweb 
              (and it's not always clear where one stops and the other begins) 
              writes of his project: 
            <blockquote> <i>The entire project is an evolving investigation into 
              the possibilities of multi-dimensional on-line environments and 
              will be one model for what many think of as a &quot;virtual museum.&quot; 
              I use this term with hesitation but acknowledge that it has become 
              common to think of an online representation as something virtual, 
              meaning unreal, and is a result of thinking in terms of multimedia 
              CD-ROM and other forms of digital delivery that have become current 
              but are not necessarily applicable to a networked environment like 
              the Internet.<br>
              <br>
              My definition of virtual would be closer to &quot;universal,&quot; 
              meaning a museum of the possible. In the end &quot;unreal&quot; 
              and &quot;universal&quot; may mean the same thing in that the term 
              &quot;universe&quot; is a metaphor for what we can't wholly comprehend, 
              a lie we tell ourselves to avoid thinking the unthinkable. So a 
              better term would be potential and that's why I subtitle this project 
              &quot;a potential museum,&quot; a &quot;house of the muses&quot; 
              that is based not on a collection, education, connoiseurship or 
              any other aspect of our current institutions but on what the muses 
              (the daughters of memory) promise -- potentiality.</i> </blockquote>
            <p> <a name="tumbleweed_t"></a> Unlike Hsin Hsin, who touts &quot;over 
              1000 digital artworks&quot; like a Corbis press release, the artwork 
              is a bit harder to find in <i>Project Tumbleweed</i>--or rather 
              the project is the artwork, to a large degree. There is a collapse 
              of container and contained. Everything is surface, no matter how 
              deep you go. As Mark Taylor writes about another architect, Bernard 
              Tschumi, in his brilliant new book, <i>Hiding</i>: 
            <blockquote><i>When reality is screened, the real becomes virtual 
              and the virtual becomes real. In his current work--especially the 
              Columbia University Student Center--Tschumi extends the processes 
              of mediaizing and virtualizing reality by transforming bodies into 
              images. The in-between space where media events are staged is folded 
              into the building in such a way that screens screen other screens. 
              Infinite screens render the real imaginary and the images real.... 
              Screens are not simply outer facades but are layered in such a way 
              that the building becomes an intricate assemblage of superimposed 
              surfaces. As bodies move across skins that run deep, the material 
              becomes immaterial and the immaterial materializes. Along the endless 
              boundary of the interface, nothing is hiding.</i><a href="#taylor_f"><font size=2>(20)</font></a></blockquote>
            There are digital reproductions of earlier paintings by Murphy, for 
            sure, but these really serve more as &quot;stations&quot; for him 
            to meditate both on his life and the construction of meaning/the meaning 
            of art. More critically than presenting some notion of his work per 
            se, built into the structure of <i>Project Tumbleweed</i> are the 
            notions of point of view and perspective. That is, Murphy acknowledges 
            and plays out multiple roles--and assumes the visitor will also be 
            coming from different points of view, whether as surfer or critic, 
            artist or player, archaeologist or diviner. The main structural way 
            this is accommodated is by three &quot;levels&quot; (perspectives): 
            <blockquote> <i>&quot;&lt;i&gt; i o l a &lt;/i&gt;&quot; is the foreground 
              (red) platform and is a personal curated interface with the rest 
              of the Internet through links to articles, e-zines, books and projects 
              updated on a daily basis. It is an &quot;entrance&quot; to the rest 
              of the project yet most of the links will take a visitor elsewhere. 
              Most institutions want to keep visitors within their own &quot;space&quot;. 
              What they don't take into consideration is that in the physical 
              building people do not materialize in the doorway, they come through 
              some mode of transportation -- walking, taxi, bus -- and from the 
              &quot;outside&quot;. The transition from &quot;outside&quot; to 
              &quot;inside&quot; is metaphorical on-line and the advantage of 
              linking would seem to be the ability to link in both directions. 
              The advantage is that it creates a space of entering with the possibility 
              of going elsewhere and that encourages return visits. The entrance 
              has a use other than as an aesthetic decompression chamber.<br>
              <br>
              From this platform you can enter the &quot;Hypomnemata&quot;, or 
              middleground (green) platform, which could also be considered as 
              a form of &quot;studio&quot; for me where I work on projects and 
              keep the information and material for those and future projects. 
              In the future this platform will be spatial using VRML, Dynamic 
              HTML and/or whatever tools are available for developing spatial 
              metaphors. I am intentionally trying to avoid thinking in terms 
              of 3-D modeling and have opted to start with the fourth dimension, 
              time (or chronology in this case) in a very simple representation. 
              Some of the projects within this platform investigate time further 
              in terms of tempo, looping and rhythm using gif animation and javascript.<br>
              <br>
              From the &quot;Hypomnemata&quot; you may enter the &quot;Undergrowth&quot;, 
              or background (blue) platform, which consists of journals from the 
              past fifteen years I am converting to digital form and uploading. 
              This will eventually include images and be a relational database 
              where my past, or some kind of history, can be reconstituted. </i>

            <p> This is a significant project that museums would do well to steal 
              as much as they can from. 
            <p> For a more traditional-seeming but thoroughly thought-provoking 
              and engaging iteration of the &quot;virtual museum,&quot; see <a href="#artist_museum_l"><i>ZoneZero: 
              From Analog to Digital Photography</i></a>. Pedro Meyer, the creator 
              of <i>ZoneZero</i>, however, makes a strong and provocative case 
              that the best way to think of <i>ZoneZero</i> and other similar 
              sites is not as a virtual version of an analog medium we already 
              think we know and understand but as a completely new form of art.

            <h3><a name="guide">Guide On the Side </a></h3>
            <p> In education, it has become commonplace shorthand to describe 
              the changing role of the teacher as going from the &quot;sage on 
              the stage&quot; to the &quot;guide on the side.&quot; Technology 
              doesn't cause this, but it can abet it. With museums' focus on outreach, 
              it may be that the role of the curator is undergoing a similar transformation. 
              And to the extent that collaborative processes are desirable, the 
              Internet is a great facilitator. 
            <p> <a name="port_t">I think the first time that I really woke to 
              this possibility was stumbling across the listserv for the exhibition: 
              </a><a href="#port_l"><i>PORT: Navigating Digital Culture</i>.</a> 
              Basically, it was an open curatorial process that anyone could participate 
              in, could propose projects for, could just listen in on. It would 
              be naive to think that all decisions were made on that listserv, 
              but basically it created a context for itself, both to test out 
              ideas and to identify opportunities.<a href="#stirfry_f"><font size=2>(21)</font></a> 
            <h3><a name="auto_curate">Auto-Curation </a></h3>
            <p> The Hsin Hsin Museum, <i>Project Tumbleweed</i>, and <i>ZoneZero</i> 
              can all be viewed as examples of auto- or self-curation by artists, 
              but there is also the idea of <i>automatic</i> curating. The most 
              likely version of this in the near future--in the present, in fact--is 
              of the &quot;make your own map&quot; variety. 
            <p> For instance, right now I can go to the Arts Wire Web base and 
              put in criteria such as that I want to see Web-specific art on museum 
              or gallery Web sites that have the word &quot;women&quot; in the 
              site description. <i>Voila</i>. Instant tour of the Web. Of course, 
              there are a number of factors affecting how well the territory is 
              covered, so to speak. How often is the database updated? How consistently 
              are criteria applied? How deep is the information catalogued? How 
              well is the contextual web captured? How spunky is the algorithm...? 
              It may not be the sexiest topic in the world, but databases like 
              those used on the National Gallery of Art and San Francisco Museum 
              of Fine Arts Web sites allow for very sophisticated interrogation 
              of the museums' resources. There is no reason--in fact, every likelihood--that 
              such cataloging will occur across the Web, across knowledge domains, 
              across artifact types. With such Xanadu-like access to information, 
              the value of the curatorial role will lie not so much in what is 
              known as in how well the stories can be told.

              a hypertext interface.</i><a href="#ilex_f"><font size=2>(23)</font></a> 
            </blockquote>
            <p> The computing challenge of ILEX is being able to generate text 
              dynamically based on tracking what the user has already viewed and 
              her level of interest. To create the text-base, the ILEX researchers 
              spent many hours interviewing the curator of the collection being 
              used (jewelry), parsing her knowledge into stories about the different 
              objects, which she had told during guided tours. 
            <p> <a name="alda_t"></a>Interestingly, in February, <i>Scientific 
              American Frontiers</i> aired a show in which &quot;Alan 2.0&quot;--a 
              realistic digital recreation of Alda's likeness--was programmed 
              to be able to speak lines he had never spoken before by accessing 
              a database of phonemes he had spoken. Imagine marrying the dynamic 
              text generation of ILEX with a realistic visual model that can speak 
              the text believably.<a href="#alda_f"><font size=2>(24)</font></a> 
              Conversation with a virtual curator that does not have to follow 
              a pre-defined script is no longer science fiction. 
            <p> The point of all this is not to hype some future of animatronic 
              curators, who know everything but don't necessarily act like they 
              do. But as society's ability to process &quot;information&quot; 
              becomes ever more fluent, we may need to refine our notions of what 
              the best roles of museums and curators are.
            <p> 
            <h2><a name="fusion">6. Hybridity and Fusion </a></h2>
            <a name="franklin_t"></a> Real virtual museums are already appearing 
            on the horizon. <a href="#franklin_l">Franklin Furnace</a>, for instance, 
            recently closed its doors and is now curating a bi-weekly performance 
            series specifically for the Internet and planning to make its extensive 
            archives available via the Web. 
            <p> By and large, however, a monolithic approach, whether toward exclusively 
              utilizing or specifically ignoring the virtual, is unlikely to be 
              a major trend. Instead of either/or, the answers will be both or 
              neither--a third way. Museums such as ZKM are already making extensive 
              efforts to integrate new media--all media--into their permanent 
              collection dispaly on a permanent basis. Conversely, museums of 
              contemporary art such as Chicago and San Diego, and the Walker Art 
              Center (among many) are making significant efforts to take their 
              programming online.
            <p> Recently, this "in between" approach has been codified (at least 
              version 1.0) in the Technorealism "manifesto." Neither savior nor 
              antichrist, technology cannot give museums a purpose, but museums 
              ignore the reality of the virtual at their peril. 
            <p> It is clear to me what innovative applications of the Net have 
              to offer museums. What is less clear is whether museums will automatically 
              "win" the cultural competition, if and when they jump into the fray 
              wholeheartedly. There is evidence both ways.
            <p> Only five years ago, you could not have had a more venerable brand 
              than Encyclopedia Britanica. Yet, essentially, a $100 CD-ROM version 
              of a defunct competitor, Funk & Wagnalls, bankrupted EB. We could 
              argue till the cows come home over whether--or rather to what extent--this 
              was a case of "the people" preferring cheapness over quality, or 
              a triumph of marketing (shades of vhs vs. beta) or a dinosaur not 
              paying attention to its future and feeling secure in a humungous 
              set of door stops costing well over $1,000, as if the format was 
              what was important, not the knowledge and information it contained 
              (does IBM ring a bell?).
            <p> So what does this have to do with museums? I think it is a cautionary 
              tale that our existence may not be guaranteed, especially in an 
              unchanging form, regardless of how impossible and even ridiculous 
              it seems now to contemplate a universe without us. Prosperity, if 
              not survival, may require an increasingly hybrid self-definition 
              and an openess to fusion and mutation.
            <p> As for curating, we have no choice. We will go where the artists 
              lead us.<br>

              Another example of how technology and the network have augmented 
              the curatorial process in a simple, fun way, is with Barbara London's 
              &quot;<a href="#port_l">Stir-Fry</a>&quot; project. We have all 
              had to write reports of our travels--of people met, art viewed--for 
              our colleagues. London, in a collaboration with adaweb, posted her 
              notes, pictures, and sound bytes to the Web on a daily basis, allowing 
              anyone to follow trace her route on a daily basis as she &quot;found&quot;
