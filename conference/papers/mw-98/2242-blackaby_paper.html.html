            <h3>Play it Again, SAMI -- Finding a Tune Museums Might Learn to Hum</h3>
            <h4><a href="../../bios/blackaby.html">Jim	
              Blackaby</a>, Senior Systems Developer, United States Holocaust 
              Memorial Museum</h4>
            <h4>Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange Format</h4>
            SAMI is an interchange format used to support closed captioning and 
            audio descriptions to provide extended accessibility to digital media.
            <p> In its broadest sense, closed captioning provides an alternate 
              and synchronous presentation of some form of media that has time 
              as one of its components. Most usually, this is a transcription 
              of words to accompany a video stream, but it might be extended to 
              include images to accompany a musical stream, translations of spoken 
              audio texts. Most usually, closed captioning appears as a text overlay 
              at the bottom of a screen, but it might be extended to include multiple 
              elements appearing anywhere within a presentation format.
            <p> Audio description is apparently less familiar than closed captioning. 
              It involves some kind of narrative overlay to describe visual materials. 
              Currently, this is interpreted as creating text descriptions of 
              video materials to make the visual materials available to blind 
              audiences. In the past, however, the techniques of audio description 
              were commonly experienced by anyone listening to a sports or live 
              news event on the radio.
            <p> SAMI is an open interchange format, but in the examples you can 
              view from here, it is realized for the web with the Microsoft ActiveMovie 
              control and Explorer 4.0. At its core, it is a very simple, and 
              it is intended to be something that can be replicated in many environments.
            <p> At its core, SAMI depends on some kind of timer or timed object 
              such as a digital sound or video file that can be used to trigger 
              events. Whne those events are triggered, something happens. That's 
              about it, really. The "something" may be the display of closed caption 
              text, but it can be other things as well.

            <h4>What Makes SAMI run?</h4>
            SAMI depends on the convergence of several acronymic developments 
            on the WWW: 
            <ul>
              <li>DOM (Document Object model) 
              <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
              <li>VBS or JS (Visual Basic or Java scripting) 
              <li>Tabular Data Control (Data Binding, vague enough not to need 
                an acronym) 
              <li>DHTML (Dynamic HTML) 
            </ul>
            <h4>DOM (Document Object model)</h4>
            As early as Netscape 2.0, browsers were enabled not only to display 
            the materials that passed through them but to create an index of each 
            of the "objects" that they were displaying. These objects were defined 
            as anything that was surrounded a pair of opening and closing HTML 
            tags, such as <strong>&lt;h2&gt;Everything in this heading plus its 
            tags are an object&lt;/h2&gt;</strong>. For the browser's own purposes 
            or peace of mind, it kept track of the fact that there was an object 
            that was surrounded by <strong>&lt;h2&gt; . . . &lt;/h2&gt;</strong> 
            tags, that it had some sequence in the document that was being displayed, 
            that it had some particular position - absolute or relative - on the 
            screen, and so on. In addition, and this is the important part, each 
            object was allowed to have a specific identifying name and to be perceived 
            as part of a class of similar things, though these are optional.
            <p> So, the heading mentioned above might have a unique identifier 
              of "subtitle" and it might be in the class of things that was to 
              be displayed in blue Garamond old style text. Its presentation would 
              then be:
            <p> <strong>
            &lt;h2 id="subtitle" class="bluestuff"&gt;Everything in this heading 
            plus its tags are an object&lt;/h2&gt;.
            <p></STRONG> Rather than having to refer to this object as "the fifth 
              item in the DOM list" which you and I might have had trouble knowing 
              anyway, it can be called by its unique id, "subtitle."
            <p> This allowed specifically manipulating the characteristics of 
              the object in the DOM's view of the world. It might have thought 
              that this object was to be displayed as the fifth object on the 
              screen all the way to the left. But for browsers that allow it (and 
              not all do all the time or for everything), the DOM's view could 
              be modified to present this object as, let's say, the second thing 
              presented, all the way to the right of the screen. This could be 
              done if the browser allowed it. For reasons probably having to do 
              with performance and "yeah? So what??" the possibility of manipulating 
              objects on the web page was not widely adopted. Internet Explorer 
              4.x is the only browser that makes all objects able to be exposed 
              to manipulation in this way.
            <p> 
            <h4>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h4>
            The underlying principle of cascading style sheets allows certain 
            attributes to be attached either to documents or to individual HTML 
            objects that might affect their appearance. This can be done in a 
            global declaration of style attributes at the beginning of a document. 
            The fact of these style sheets five greater freedom in managing the 
            appearance of objects on an HTML page, but it also makes managing 
            style much easier, because one only has to change the style sheet 
            rather than individual items.
            <p> One way of expressing things in the style sheet is to assign stylistic 
              values to tags. To make all ordered lists in an otherwise uninspired 
              document appear in red, arial type, the ordered list tag would be 
              given the following definition in the <strong>&lt;style&gt;</strong> 
              portion of a document:
            <p> <strong>
            &lt;ol&gt; {color:red; font-family:arial}
            <p></STRONG> Another way of expressing things in the style sheet is 
              to assign stylistic values to classes. Then, objects that are defined 
              as being in those classes will take on the class stylistic attributes 
              rather than whatever they might normally have. This would be expressed 
              in the <strong>&lt;style&gt;</strong> portion of a document as:
            <p> <strong>
            .bluestuff {color:blue; font-family:garamond}
            <p></STRONG> for instance. The heading in mentioned in the previous 
              section <strong>&lt;h2 id="subtitle" class="bluestuff"&gt;</strong> 
              would follow the rules of the bluestuff style characteristics. Ordered 
              lists that were not assigned to any class would be in red arial, 
              but if one ordered list were specified as being <strong>&lt;ol class="bluestuff"&gt;</strong> 
              it would follow the rule for the class rather than its more general 
              object definition.
            <p> 
            <h4>VBS and JS (Visual Basic and Java scripting languages)</h4>
            These scripting languages allow programmatic things to happen to pages 
            that are otherwise pretty static when certain events occur. The things 
            that can happen are limited to simple things that can be managed by 
            sets of instructions put in scripts, but that does not make this a 
            trivial approach to making things happen. Among the things that scripts 
            can do is to make things happen to objects that it can identify. This 
            is generally done by referring to the id's that DOM made available. 
            One thing that a script might do, for instance, would be to find the 
            object named "subtitle" and change its style (currently it is blue, 
            you'll recall) characteristics so that it displays as green. Another 
            thing a script might do is to modify the content of that object changing 
            the text between the tags that defined it as an object to be "Hey, 
            How Did that Happen?" instead of "Everything in this heading plus 
            its tags are an object"
            <p> 
            <h4>Tabular Data Control (Data Binding, vague enough not to need an 
              acronym)</h4>
            I think that SAMI uses this. If it does not use this, it uses something 
            very like it.
            <p> Tabular Data Control allows taking an outside data source that 
              is in a specified format and attaching it to a particular object 
              on a web page. If the Data Table has, for instance, a list of painting 
              titles, it could be attached to the object with the id of "subtitle" 
              we have been discussing, and then a script could be written that 
              would have the contents that was written between the two tags change 
              every time there was some event like a mouse click.
            <p> 
            <h4>DHTML (Dynamic HTML)</h4>
            Dynamic HTML kind of glues all of the above together in a structure 
            that enables all of these tricks and also is always reflecting on 
            itself so that if items in the DOM listing have been modified - like 
            their class has been changed or the text between the tags in an object 
            has been specified to be different - those changes are reflected on 
            the screen.
            <p> 
            <h4>One more necessary thing that has no acronym:</h4>
            A clock or something that works like one.
            <p> 
            <h4>When SAMI is running what happens?</h4>
            Lots of things are possible, but the simplest to imagine is closed 
            captioning. As a piece of digital media runs in a web page, words 
            appear beneath the picture that reflect what is being said in the 
            media.
            <p> To make this happen you need to have a piece of media that has 
              time codes that can be identified, a transcript of what is said 
              on the media with an idea of how the transcript relates to the time 
              codes, and a little thoughtful patience.
            <p> The media is embedded in a web page as an object, and the transcript 
              is marked with tags to identify each passage that is to appear as 
              closed captioning. The text is then made invisible, and the tags 
              are bound to an external SAMI file. Each tag is given an id that 
              corresponds to its time in the media stream. So, you might have 
              something that looked like this:
            <p> <strong>&lt;span id=1 class="cc-eng"&gt;</strong>This is the beginning 
              of my talk<strong>&lt;/span&gt;</strong><br>
              <strong>&lt;span id=1000 class="cc-eng"&gt;</strong>which is being 
              measured in milliseconds<strong>&lt;/span&gt;</strong><br>
              <strong>&lt;span id=2000 class="cc-eng"&gt;</strong>so that it seems 
              like lots is happening.<strong>&lt;/span&gt;</strong><br>
              <strong>&lt;span id=3200 class="cc-eng"&gt;</strong>Actually, it 
              is not long enough<strong>&lt;/span&gt;</strong><br>
              <strong>&lt;span id=4100 class="cc-eng"&gt;</strong>to fall asleep 
              to.<strong>&lt;/span&gt;</strong>
            <p> The bound file has some SAMI administrative stuff including parameters 
              that pointed to the piece of media and that indicated its length 
              and the time units. In addition, it defines a CSS class called ENUSCC 
              (for English-American Closed Captions) and has as its body:
            <p> <strong>
            &lt;SYNC Start=1&gt;<br>
            &lt;P Class=ENUSCC&gt;&lt;SPAN ID="1"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;<br>
            &lt;SYNC Start=1000&gt;<br>
            &lt;P Class=ENUSCC&gt;&lt;SPAN ID="1000"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;<br>
            &lt;SYNC Start=2000&gt;<br>
            &lt;P Class=ENUSCC&gt;&lt;SPAN ID="2000"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;<br>
            &lt;SYNC Start=3200&gt;<br>
            &lt;P Class=ENUSCC&gt;&lt;SPAN ID="3200"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;<br>
            &lt;SYNC Start=4100&gt;<br>
            &lt;P Class=ENUSCC&gt;&lt;SPAN ID="4100"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;<br>
            &lt;SYNC Start=4900&gt;<br>
            &lt;P Class=ENUSCC&gt;END
            <p></STRONG> What seems to be going on is that as the media plays, 
              it sends time codes to this SAMI file, and when a time code is passed, 
              it sends the name of the object that ought to be on view (via something 
              like Tabular Data Control), and when that is received, a script 
              makes the object that is connected with the one that has been sent 
              visible.
            <p> It is pretty simple, really.
            <p> 
            <h4>So what?</h4>
            There are several amazing things that this technology enables: 
            <ol>
              <li>You can quickly and easily provide synchronous closed captioning 
                to media events -- any kind -- songs, video, video games that 
                have timers, visits into museum gallery space if there is some 
                kind of timing mechanism or triggering mechanism that fires when 
                something happens (like a long look at an image). This is great 
                for everyone. 
              <li>You can make anything visible. Text is the easiest, but there 
                is no reason why you can't show pictures, change the text on the 
                screen, or do any of a number of other simple multi-media like 
                things. 
              <li>You can attach SAMI files in multiple languages so that this 
                mechanism can become one for providing multi-lingual access. 
              <li>You can use the technology "backwards" Just as you can play 
                a media file and have it display text by virtue of having the 
                text marked as DOM objects, you can write a script that will identify 
                a part of the text that has been selected and have that launch 
                the media. 
            </ol>
            These are all wonderful tricks, but besides that, they go far to provide 
            useful techniques to help us speak to our audiences. Those who have 
            worked with issues of access and special needs will not be surprised 
            to see that the techniques of reaching a wider audience serve the 
            interests of all.

            <h4>Where to Get It</h4>
            SAMI has been developed jointly by WGBH and Microsoft among others 
            as an open interchange format. You can read more about it and the 
            other access programs of Microsoft at: <a href="../http://microsoft.com/enable/" target="_blank">http://microsoft.com/enable/</a>. 
            SAMI is more of an idea than an "it" that you can get. What is important 
            is to think about how you can use this approach, and after you've 
            played with it a while, you'll find that you've got it!
            <p> David Bolnick (<a href="mailto:davebo@microsoft.com">davebo@microsoft.com</a>) 
              is the head of the accessibility program, and he is an enthusiastic 
              supporter of the possibilities of these technologies. At the present 
              time, the SAMI format is being integrated into Microsoft's active 
              controls. But, it is important to recognize that this is really 
              a very straight forward format. At the USHMM, we expect to be writing 
              our own versions of SAMI as part of making use of video cards that 
              use their own media players. Using the MS Direct Show control is 
              easy because it is available, but this approach to linking text 
              and media is by no means limited to Microsoft products. Indeed, 
              they should be given due credit to putting the resources behind 
              providing these kinds of tools for all audiences.
            <p> What has been most useful to me is taking apart the samples that 
              Dave Bolnick has made to see how they work. There are many ways 
              of doing this. I am happy to share my own experiences. My address 
              is <a href="mailto:jblackaby@ushmm.org">jblackaby@ushmm.org</a> 
              and Bob Twitty who works with me (<a href="mailto:rtwitty@ushmm.org">rtwitty@ushmm.org</a>) 
              can provide information about some of the issues of incorporating 
              these techniques into other API's and other media players.
