              Abstract</a> </h3>
          </center>
          <blockquote> Traditionally museum visitors have had to physically go 
            to a museum to experience what it has to offer. However, many museums 
            can now be accessed directly from anywhere in the world via an Internet 
            connection. Of course the facilities on offer on-line are different 
            and not of the same quality as the real museum itself. However access 
            to some resources such as the museum store and records could potentially 
            be better than those available at the actual museum. This article 
            explores how museums have been using the Internet for access to their 
            collections, and how they could use it in the future, especially from 
            the virtual visitor's point of view. Two case studies of a large and 
            small museum which have embraced the technology seriously are included.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          Access to museums can be difficult for some people because of the expense 
          of travel. The 
          <!http://www.isoc.org/>
          <a target="_top" href=../http://www.internet.org/> Internet</A> computer 
          "network of networks" provides a low-cost and instantaneous means of 
          transmitting museums information to people over great distances using 
          the extremely popular <a target="_top" href=../http://www.w3.org/> World 
          Wide Web</A> (WWW, or Web for short) global hypermedia system (<a name=Berners-Lee96ref href=#Berners-Lee96>Berners-Lee, 
          1996</a>). However, a significant difficulty with the <a target="_top" href=../http://www.isoc.org/> 
          Internet</A> is finding information of interest (<a name=Johnson97ref href=#Johnson97>Johnson, 
          1997</a>). Automated "search engines" can provide search facilities 
          using keywords, but this can be a somewhat hit and miss affair in practice, 
          requiring significant selection skill on the part of the user. On-line 
          directories, maintained by experts, are one way that information in 
          a particular domain, such as museums, can be presented in a well thought 
          out manner. 
          <p> In this article we consider the ways the museums can interact with 
            their visitors using the Internet. Issues with respect to the type 
            of visitor and the rapidly changing technical facilities available 
            are discussed. The experiences of two museums, one of national status 
            and one of small but ambitious stature, are included. Finally a view 
            of possible developments in the future is posited. 
          <p> 
          <h2>Background</h2>
          Museums are traditionally information providers, drawing on and interpreting 
          their collections for their visitors. Schools, the general public, tourists, 
          scholars, etc., all potential museum visitors, are information gatherers. 
          Traditionally these gatherers have visited the information providers 
          such as museums. Now, with the advent of the Internet, it is increasingly 
          possible for the providers to reach out and give the gatherers experiences 
          while still located in their home (<a name=Kraut96ref href=#Kraut96>Kraut, 
          1996</a>), work place, school, local library, etc. 
          <p> To quote from an <a target="_top" href=../http://www.vmirror.com/rov-int/museums.html> 
            on-line article on Virtual Museums</a> by <a name=Argoski95ref href=#Argoski95> 
            Jason Argoski (1995)</a>: 
          <blockquote><font size=+1><em> The new [on-line] users are looking for 
            both information and amusement. And these, of course, are the very 
            attributes that all good museums share. </em></font></blockquote>
          <p> Museums are well-placed to provide real content that is appealing 
            to network users. 
          <p> 
          <h2>What is the Network?</h2>
          The Internet computer network is a new medium which now exists alongside 
          other more traditional communication media (<a name=McLuhan64ref href=#McLuhan64>McLuhan, 
          1964</a>) such as mail, newspapers, radio, telephone, television, etc. 
          Anyone involved in communicating information can benefit from its use, 
          including museums. The network provides a number of facilities which 
          can aid in the virtual museum visitor experience: 
          <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> <a href=mailto:>Electronic mail</a> (or "email" for brevity) 
              allows visitors to send queries to museum curators and other staff. 
              These can be answered in a timely manner far more easily than traditional 
              postal mail. Email messages are normally more informal than letters 
              and replies can include sections of the original message annotated 
              with answers. Like letters, and unlike telephone or personal calls, 
              email can be answered at a time convenient for the curator. Sending 
              an email can be a much less intimating experience for the sender 
              than contacting a professional by letter or phone. It is often significantly 
              cheaper, especially for international communication. Thus interaction 
              between museum staff and the public is likely to increase, which 
              may become a more important role for many in the museum profession. 
              <p> 
            <li> <a href=news:>Newsgroups</a> and mailing lists allow discussion 
              between a group of people, potentially geographically distributed 
              throughout the world. <a href=../http://www.dejanews.com/>Newsgroups</A> 
              are divided into thousands of specialized topics These discussion 
              groups may be "moderated" by a moderator who checks messages for 
              suitability before they are distributed, or "unmoderated", in which 
              case messages are sent out immediately. Moderated groups are generally 
              of higher quality because human intervention provides an editing 
              process. 
              <p> Museums could use suitable newsgroups to publicize their activities. 
                So far they have not taken advantage of this very cheap avenue 
                of information dissemination to any great extent, perhaps due 
                to lack of appreciation of the possibilities offered to interact 
                with potential visitors. 
              <p> A museum may wish to set up its own electronic mailing list 
                for distributing announcements of events and developments to interested 
                potential visitors (both virtual and physical), in a similar but 
                possibly much more informal and responsive way to postal mailing 
                lists (e.g., for "friends" of the museum). A larger museum could 
                have further lists for more specialized discussion. The expense 
                is far less and turnaround much faster than traditional communication 
                means such as mail. 
              <p> 
            <li> The World Wide Web is perhaps the most widely known aspect of 
              the Internet, and the two are sometimes confused. The Web is a distributed 
              but linked information system. The concept of globally hyperlinked 
              information has been established for some time (<a name=Bush45ref href=#Bush45>Bush, 
              1945</a>), but the required infrastructure has only burgeoned recently. 
              <p> The Web consists of "servers" (computers acting as information 
                providers) and "clients" running "browsers" programs for end-users 
                (gatherers). A major reason for the Web's popularity is the very 
                easy and natural point and click interface for navigation around 
                the available information. 
              <p> Increasingly, multimedia using graphics, sound, video, etc., 
                as well as text is possible. A recent survey (<a name=Reynolds97ref href=#Reynolds97>Reynolds, 
                1997</a>; summarized in <a name=Futers97ref href=#Futers97>Futers, 
                1997</a>) indicates that 87% of people visiting museum Web sites 
                expect images. A major limiting factor is the speed of access, 
                but this is likely to increase in the future (although not as 
                fast as many would like). 
              <p> 
          </ul>
          <h2>Why use the Network?</h2>
          It is worth considering the reasons why a museum might wish to use the 
          Internet. A number of these are enumerated here, some of which are generally 
          applicable to many organizations, and some of which are more specific 
          to the museum sector in particular: 
          <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> Maintaining a presence on the Internet provides the potential 
              for instant worldwide publicity. Information such as tourist information, 
              opening hours, press releases, etc., may be included. At the most 
              basic level the information may be considered as "brochure-ware", 
              containing much the same material that may be found in a glossy 
              leaflet describing and advertising the facilities offered by the 
              museum. 
              <p> 
            <li> Fast and convenient communication with colleagues, the public, 
              etc., is possible using electronic mail. This depends on building 
              up a critical mass of visitors with suitable email access. 
              <p> 
            <li> An important facility for museums is the possibility of virtual 
              exhibitions, perhaps mirroring actual exhibitions in the galleries, 
              both temporary and permanent, but also allowing access to material 
              not otherwise generally available (e.g., objects in store, normally 
              by far of the majority of a serious museum's collection, or those 
              too fragile or sensitive for display). A recent survey has discovered 
              that around three quarters of virtual visitors expect to find virtual 
              exhibitions at museum Web sites (<a href=#Futers97>Futers, 1997</a>; 
              <a href=#Reynolds97>Reynolds, 1997</a>). 
              <p> 
            <li> The network may be seen as an alternative, cheap, and complementary 
              form of information provision. In just the same way that recorded 
              music on CDs encourages rather than discourages attendance at live 
              music concerts, virtual exhibitions are likely to act as a draw 
              for those who are local enough and can afford to see the real thing. 
              <p> 
            <li> Remote access avoids the expense of travel, especially for international 
              access. Availability of on-line material is not affected significantly 
              by distance, apart from speed of downloading. Potential visitors 
              who may not be able to appreciate a museum's collection in any other 
              way can be given a chance to do so; and of course they may be encouraged 
              to visit the museum at a later date if the opportunity arises. 
              <p> 
            <li> On-line information gives relatively easy disabled access compared 
              to installing the required physical facilities in an actual museum. 
              Thus those who may never have a chance to visit a museum can be 
              afforded some degree of experience by the museum. 
              <p> 
            <li> An important development for the future will be increasing availability 
              of on-line databases for remote scholarly research of collections 
              (<a name=Mannoni97ref href=#Mannoni97>Mannoni, 1997</a>). The possibility 
              of searching across a wide range of information distributed around 
              the world is now physically possible. If existing museum catalogues 
              can be digitized, research which previous took months or years could 
              take orders of magnitude less time to undertake. 
              <p> 
          </ul>
          In any case, it is very important for a museum to think carefully about 
          why it wants or needs a virtual Web site, and what potential benefits 
          this could bring (<a name=Strimpel95ref href=#Strimpel95>Strimpel, 1995</a>;

          <p> 
          <h2>Virtual Museum Sites</h2>
          Sites containing museum information may be set up for a variety of reasons 
          and can give very different virtual experiences for on-line visitors. 
          The following are a few examples of why museum Web sites have been established 
          and what can be expected as a result: 
          <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> Enthusiasts, perhaps with no formal contact with a museum, sometimes 
              set up information, often very worthwhile in nature. This is especially 
              likely for specialist museums concerning popular hobbies (e.g., 
              railway museums) or in areas where important museums exist without 
              good information available. 
              <p> The problem here is that the information can date relatively 
                quickly, perhaps because the individual loses interest, moves 
                from the institution where the information is provided (often 
                a university), or whatever. However, this may not be immediately 
                obvious to the average virtual visitor, who could easily be misled. 
              <p> 
            <li> Information may be provided as part of some tourist resource. 
              The information is normally perfunctory in nature, but can act as 
              useful "brochure-ware" for potential visitors to museums, including 
              opening times, entrance fees, directions to the museum, etc. Provided 
              the content is kept up to date, this can be a useful source of information 
              on museums for visitors. 
              <p> 
            <li> Local government is in a good position to provide information 
              on local museums in a particular area. For example, in the UK, most 
              local councils provide some sort of on-line information, indexed 
              from the central government Web server under <a target="_top" href=../http://www.open.gov.uk/><tt>http://www.open.gov.uk/</tt></A>. 
              Some (but not yet many) now provide good museum information, again 
              normally in the form of brochure-ware. 
              <p> 
            <li> In some countries, the central government is itself directly 
              instrumental in providing and promoting on-line museum-related information. 
              For example, in France the Ministry of Culture has an extensive 
              Web site (<a name=Mannoni96ref href=#Mannoni96>Mannoni, 1996</a>, 
              see under <a target="_top" href=../http://www.culture.fr/><tt>http://www.culture.fr/</tt></A>), 
              and provides some significant databases which are accessible on-line 
              around the world (<a href=#Mannoni97>Mannoni, 1997</a>). 
              <p> 
            <li> Some regional museums services are setting up museum-related 
              sites which often list the museums in their area. This normally 
              only consists of basic information, but at least the providers are 
              in a position to maintain the information, and hopefully develop 
              it further in the future, perhaps in collaboration with the museums 
              concerned. The North of England Museums Service is developing such 
              a site, which may be helpful for tourists to the region, local schools, 
              etc. 
              <p> 
            <li> A museum may itself decide to create a site for marketing, educational 
              or other purposes. Often the impetus for such a site results from 
              the efforts of an enthusiast within the museum rather than a directive 
              from the management of the museum, although this is likely to change 
              as understanding of the Internet percolates through to higher levels 
              of management. 
              <p> A dedicated museum Web site obviously has the potential to provide 
                the most comprehensive and dynamic information on the museum concerned. 
                Only if the museum itself is directly involved in the production 
                of a Web site is the virtual visitor likely to gain anything but 
                the most superficial experience of the museum's resources, and 
                even then much effort and expertise is required from the museum 
                itself. 
              <p> 
          </ul>
          Commercial production of a Web site is expensive and often results in 
          a site which may look impressive when accessed locally, but could be 
          very slow for more remote access. It may well lack real content unless 
          there has been a high degree of effective interaction with museum staff. 
          In addition, maintenance of the Web site will be a significant and continuing 
          expense if undertaken commercially. Unfortunately unmaintained sites 
          tend to date quickly. For example, a current list of events at the museum, 
          accurate opening times, admission prices, etc., are desirable. A major 
          benefit of the Web is that updates can potentially be done very cheaply 
          if a reasonable amount of technical expertise is gained by one or more 
          of the museum's staff.

            1996</a>, <a name=Bowen97aref href=#Bowen97a> 1997a</a>, <a name=Bowen97bref href=#Bowen97b> 
            1997b)</a> considers a number of museum sites and briefly discuss 
            their potential interest to virtual visitors. The <a target="_top" href=../http://www.icom.org/vlmp/> 
            Virtual Library museums pages</A> (VLmp) also described in these papers 
            and elsewhere (e.g., see <a name=Marshall96ref href=#Marshall96>Marshall, 
            1996</a>) provide an extensive directory of on-line museums categorized 
            by country. This was originated by Bowen in 1994 and was adopted by 
            the <a target="_top" href=../http://www.icom.org/> International Council 
            of Museums</A> (ICOM) in 1996. ICOM wishes to keep abreast of technology 
            (<a name=Anderson97ref href=#Anderson97>Anderson, 1997</a>) and the 
            Internet provides an ideal way to bring the international professional 
            museum closer together (<a name=Karp97ref href=#Karp97>Karp, 1997</a>). 
            Volunteers for around the world now maintain information for specific 
            countries within VLmp. The directory provides a good starting point 
            for any potential virtual visitor wishing to explore on-line museums 
            (see under <a target="_top" href=../http://www.icom.org/vlmp/><tt>http://www.icom.org/vlmp/</tt></A>). 
          <p> In this article two example museums are considered in more detail 
            by personnel from the museums themselves. One example is a very large 
            museum, in fact the first to have itself own Web server in the United 
            Kingdom. The other is a much smaller museum in physical terms, but 
            is one that has embraced the technology enthusiastically and effectively. 
            On-line is it perfectly possible for a small museum to outshine a 
            large museum, and also to do so at a fraction of the financial cost 
            if suitably qualified enthusiastic volunteers with the right technological 
            expertise and design flair are available. 
          <p> 
          <h2>Case Study 1: A large museum</h2>
          The Natural History Museum in London first ventured onto the Web in 
          January of 1994, and was the first UK national museum to have a WWW 
          site (see under <a target="_top" href=../http://www.nhm.ac.uk/><tt>http://www.nhm.ac.uk/</tt></A>). 
          At first, the Web pages were simply a link into the Museum's library 
          database, but it was soon realised that they could be used to promote 
          the Museum and advertise new exhibitions. New material was added and 
          the site grew organically. 
          <p> By the middle of 1995, it was decided that the Web site needed a 
            complete overhaul. The overall design and layout of the pages was 
            not of the high editorial and design standards that the Museum requires 
            in it's printed literature. It was decided that the site should be 
            given a "look and feel" consistent with the Museum's corporate identity, 
            and a navigation system that would allow the visitor intuitive access 
            to all the material. 
          <p> The re-design of the site took around five man-months to complete, 
            and the re-designed site went live in December of 1995. The launch 
            received publicity in the Information Technology sections of the UK 
            national daily papers, and several articles in the computer press. 
            Almost immediately after the launch, the site experienced a rapid 
            rise in usage, with the number of users increasing almost three-fold. 
            This increase was not just a temporary peak, but has been maintained 
            since then. <a name=fig1ref href=#fig1>Figure 1</a> shows the increase 
            in usage of the site over one year from August 1995. The dotted line 
            shows a 4% projection which illustrates an estimate of the average 
            growth in number of users of the Web as a whole. 
          <p> In 1996, the Museum Web site received about 20,000 visitors a month, 
            approximately one sixth of the number of visitors the Museum receives 
            through the door. <a name=fig2ref></a><a href=#fig2>Figure 2</a> shows 
            that the majority of these visitors are from the UK or US. The demographics 
            of visitors to the Museum's Web site is similar to that of the Virtual 
            Library museums pages (VLmp) suggesting that it is similar to the 
            demographics of the Web as a whole. However, the NHM's Web site differs 
            from VLmp's in that it has a much higher proportion of visitors from 
            the UK (compare <a name=fig3ref>
          <a href=#fig3>Figure 3</a>). This suggests that although physical location 
          has little influence on the accessibility of material on the Web, people 
          still prefer to access material from the Web sites of organizations 
          of which they are familiar due to their physical proximity. 
          <p> The feedback form on the NHM's Web site has provided further information 
            about visitors to the site. Educational establishments are well represented, 
            with around one third of visitors from universities and about one 
            fifth from schools and colleges. The museum receives feedback from 
            teachers and educationalists using the Web site in the classroom, 
            mainly in the US and Canada. There is little evidence that schools 
            in the UK are using the Web in the classroom yet. Around one fifth 
            of visitors to the Web site are business people, often browing the 
            Web from work during their lunch break. 
          <p> Overall the Museum's Web site has proved to be a valuable and very 
            cost-effective means of communicating to a wide audience. We anticipate 
            the significance of the Web to grow significantly for the Museum in 
            the coming years, and it is likely to become a vital tool in the NHM's 
            mission to maintain and develop its collections and to use them to 
            promote the discovery, understanding, responsible use and enjoyment 
            of the natural world. 
          <p> In 1997 the museum put on a "Virtual Endeavour" temporary exhibition 
            using state-of-the-art virtual reality technology to present Captain 
            Cook's ship the Endeavour. A survey was undertaken to evaluate visitors' 
            experiences of the exhibition. This indicated that the major draw 
            for younger visitors was the ability for free movement around the 
            ship, whereas for older visitors, the content of the exhibition was 
            most important. 
          <p> This type of exhibit is currently only possible for visitors actually 
            visiting the museum because it requires computer hardware costing 
            around fifty times that available in most homes, and would need an 
            extremely fast connection if delivered remotely over a network. However 
            given the rapid exponential advances in the speed of computer technology, 
            we can expect this type of virtual exhibition to be possible on the 
            Internet in years to come. Meanwhile, an on-line exhibit using today's 
            generally available technology is accessible from: <a target="_top" href=../http://www.nhm.ac.uk/VRendeavour/><tt>http://www.nhm.ac.uk/VRendeavour/</tt></a>

          <h2>Case Study 2: A small museum</h2>
          A few words are needed to introduce the relevant characteristics of 
          the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford. It is a small museum, 
          with a total staff of under eight full-time-equivalent posts, including 
          warding and cleaning staff. We have an outstanding collection of early 
          scientific instruments, housed a building of the first importance for 
          museum history - the original home of the Ashmolean Museum, built for 
          that purpose in 1683. As part of the University of Oxford, we are an 
          academic museum, involved in teaching and expected to carry on research 
          as well as acting as a research resource for the history of science 
          community. Our displays reflect these academic interests and, in particular, 
          our special exhibitions have historical themes relevant to current concerns 
          in the history of science. 
          <p> Despite the academic setting, we see ourselves as enthusiastically 
            a public museum and we want to communicate more effectively with our 
            visitors. We are keen to have more visitors and to offer them a more 
            involving and rewarding experience, and we seem to be having some 
            success in this respect. Visitor numbers have more than doubled over 
            the last couple of years. 
          <p> Since all of this is relevant to understanding our Web site, perhaps 
            an important point must be that a site should be individual and serve 
            the particular set of needs of the museum concerned. If it is to be 
            valued by staff and visitors, it needs to grow up in the museum, and 
            to represent what those involved care about. It is doubtful whether 
            it could be introduced successfully without a great deal of thought 
            and consultation. While you can gather ideas from other sites, it 
            would not be wise to do too much copying. The ingredients must come 
            from the museum and the museum must set the agenda. 
          <p> We were one of the first academic museums to offer substantial material 
            via the Web, and it might be wondered why we bothered. We had plenty 
            of other things to do and, in any case, there were certain risks involved. 
            In academic circles in Britain the Web was - and to some extent still 
            is - associated with superficiality and triviality, and not without 
            justification, since much of the material on offer is disappointing. 
            We had to endure a fair amount of disdainful snorting and scepticism. 
          <p> It is easier to explain how this affected our approach to building 
            a site than to explain why we bothered in the first place. But new 
            staff with experience of networks elsewhere introduced an enthusiasm 
            for linking the Museum to the extending university network and for 
            maximizing its usefulness. We then approached Web applications for 
            our newly installed local Ethernet network in an experimental frame 
            of mind. It was the coming thing and we wanted to be there - an unworthy 
            motive admittedly, but a human one. We could see advantages for accessibility 
            and publicity, and we relished the opportunity to challenge our somewhat 
            staid and austere image by being fairly early with something new, 
            unexpected and unproved. 
          <p> How did we get started? There we had the unfair advantage of being 
            part of a university. This gave us access to the support and advice 
            of a computing service, and meant that we were connected to a local 
            network and through this to the <a target="_top" href=../http://www.ja.net/> 
            Joint Academic Network, JANET</A>. It also meant that there were mainframe 
            computers on which we could lobby for space. We deliberately did not 
            build up gradually. Visiting sites "under construction" is always 
            a dispiriting experience: so many links take you to apologies and 
            appeals for indulgence. We felt that, such was the scepticism in our 
            world, that we had to offer something worthwhile from the word go, 
            so we launched only when we were satisfied that this was the case. 
          <p> We found that getting started was not so difficult as might be thought. 
            We do not have an IT officer and there is no-one on the staff with 
            a qualification in computer science. It was useful that the university 
            runs relevant training courses and we did manage to find someone who, 
            though not formally qualified, was particularly enthusiastic and talented, 
            and to find some funds to employ him part-time. By giving him day 
            to day responsibility for maintaining the site and for designing its 
            various features, he was able to develop his knowledge and skill. 
            It is due to this member of staff, Giles Hudson, that the site maintains 
            a high standard of presentation. The relative ease mentioned earlier 
            relates to the situation when we began; there are potential difficulties 
            when dealing with prospects for the future. 
          <p> Like most people in museum work, "our world" was a world of objects, 
            and it is from this obvious truth that much of the scepticism we met 
            derived. It was not a world where the real could be replaced by the 
            virtual. Of course no-one involved with museums on the Web imagines 
            that it could, but there is a fear in some quarters that this might 
            be a creeping displacement of traditional museum virtues, rather than 
            an adjunct to them. We had to demonstrate that there was something 
            worthwhile here even for object-based scholarship. 
          <p> This was one reason why, from the beginning, the star attraction 
            was the presentation of a virtual version of the then current special 
            exhibition, "The Measurers: a Flemish Image of Mathematics in the 
            Sixteenth Century". This was meant to be a serious contribution to 
            the history of science, with a fairly challenging narrative, detailed 
            catalogue entries and very large images. It was important to prove 
            to our traditional audience that worthwhile material could be offered 
            on the Web. The success of this virtual exhibition has led to a policy 
            decision to offer virtual editions of each of our special exhibitions. 
            These are available in the gallery alongside the real exhibition and 
            also worldwide over the Internet. They contain much more information 
            than can be presented through the traditional resources of an exhibition 
            - labels, graphics, and so on - and, since the images are offered 
            at different resolutions, it is often possible to see more detail 
            on the computer screen than in the showcase. In addition, the exhibitions 
            are available via the Internet from anywhere at any time. 
          <p> Further, we do not remove the virtual exhibitions when the real 
            ones are dismantled, so they stack up into a library of exhibitions. 
            It has been very helpful that we design our exhibition catalogues 
            on computers in house, as much of this work contributes to making 
            the virtual exhibitions. At present they are available from distant 
            computers via the Internet and also via a public computer located 
            in the museum. It has been very rewarding for the curators that all 
            the work involved in organizing an exhibition is not lost when it 
            is dismounted. The main benefit, of course, is accessibility for the 
            public and, despite the fears of some traditionalists, there is evidence 
            of virtual visitors being stimulated to come along in person, as well 
            as of history of science courses in other universities making use 
            of our material on the Web. 
          <p> If the virtual editions of special exhibitions represent our major 
            effort, we also offer other things on the site. There is information 
            about the museum, of course, about the graduate course taught in the 
            museum, and about publications and postcards. Our newsletters are 
            published electronically as well as in print. There is a small image 
            library, a response form for comments and suggestions, and a collection 
            of links to other sites concerned with the history of scientific instruments. 
            In addition, we sometimes add virtual exhibitions that have no counterpart 
            in the galleries. One, for example, is of early photographic images 
            that we could not display for any length of time. Space is made available 
            for our students to mount their own virtual exhibitions based on material 
            in the collections, and the first of these is now on-line. 
          <p> What difficulties have we experienced? Where we have included large 
            images - some in "The Measurers" exhibition are as large as 2 or 3 
            MBytes - downloading can be very slow, and well-nigh impossible for 
            users not connected to the high-speed UK university Wide Area Network 
            <a href=../http://www.ja.net/> SuperJANET</A>. We have modified this 
            in later exhibitions. A more serious difficulty is keeping pace with 
            technical and design developments. Sites tend to be judged by appearances 
            and it will become increasingly difficult for a small organization 
            not to look dated, but that is a familiar problem in more traditional 
            museum media. For the future, we look forward to improving accessibility 
            to object documentation, and to developing shared resources with museums 
            in the same field. One such initiative was successful in obtaining 
            a grant from the European Commission, and our existing commitment 
            to accessibility via the Web was a factor in the success of our bid. 
          <p> In summary, we have found developing a Web site (location: <a target="_top" href=../http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/><tt>http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/</tt></A>) 
            really worth doing, with increased accessibility as the chief virtue. 
            The library of special exhibitions is probably our best and most valuable 
            feature. It is vital for the museum curators to be as involved as 
            possible, so that the site really reflects the interests and priorities 
            of the museum. We are continuing to update the Web site as the technology 
            develops (<a name=Sphaera97ref href=#Sphaera97>Sph&aelig;ra, 1997</a>). 
          <p> 
          <h2>Some Advice</h2>
          Producing a Web site can be difficult for museums. The first question 
          should be "Why do we want or need a Web site?". Answers will vary for 
          different museums, but it is very important to consider the experience 
          from the point of view of the virtual visitor and what they might wish 
          to gain from using the museum Web site, rather than just considering 
          what the museum has to offer. Here are some points to consider when 
          creating a museum Web site: 
          <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> Find an expert in the technology. For a large museum this may 
              be a professional company, which could cost a significant amount 
              of money, or it could be an enthusiastic volunteer for a smaller 
              museum. 
              <p> 
            <li> Use university contacts if possible. Museums normally have both 
              educational and commercial roles. It is worth exploiting academic 
              contacts since all universities already have good network access 
              and experience which it may be possible to exploit. For example, 
              computer science students may be very willing to undertake Web-based 
              projects in conjunction with a museum, at no financial cost to the 
              museum. 
              <p> 
            <li> Do not try to re-create the "traditional" museum experience. 
              The Web is a different medium with its own strengths and weaknesses 
              which should be exploited to enhance the virtual visitor experience. 
              Vast amounts of information such as museum catalogue databases can 
              be made available on-line at relatively little cost since computer 
              disk storage is cheap. 
              <p> 
            <li> Design Web pages with care. There are many technicalities and 
              tricks of the trade which may be used to dramatically improve the 
              apparent downloading speed of Web pages. Graphical images should 
              be used sparingly for fast access, especially on pages used to traverse 
              a Web site. 
              <p> Any multimedia content requiring significant downloading time 
                should be at the "leaves" of the hierarchy of Web pages within 
                a Web site. The average time spent by a Web user on most pages 
                is only a few seconds since much time is spent following links 
                from page to page in order to arrive at a page where the content 
                may be of actual interest to the visitor. This process should 
                be made as painless and as fast as possible to ensure the visitor 
                is not discouraged. 
              <p> Obvious and consistent navigation aids should be included on 
                all pages within a Web site to allow a visitor to move easily 
                within the site. For example, in a physical museum it may be difficult 
                to find the entrance hall from some galleries, but in a virtual 
                museum all locations should include a hyperlink directly back 
                to the "home page" for the museum. 
              <p> 
            <li> Keep your WWW pages up to date. Continuously updating a Web site 
              with new virtual exhibitions, and the latest information on activities, 
              opening times, etc., at the real museum will encourage re-visits. 
              <p> Museum personnel must be actively involved in the Web site content 
                for its long-term success. One feature lacking in most current 
                museum Web sites, although highly popular and encouraged at academic 
                university sites, is the inclusion of a "home page" for each member 
                of staff, with interests, individual contact details such as an 
                email address, a photograph, publications, links to further personal 
                pages or interests, etc. This adds a personal touch totally lacking 
                in most commercial Web sites. Given that museums engage in commercial 
                and educational activities, more informal and dynamic areas in 
                a museum's Web sites should be encouraged, as well as the formal 
                more controlled parts. Such facilities will encourage interaction 
                with virtual visitors. 
              <p> 
            <li> Avoid making high-quality graphical images available unless you 
              are happy for them to be reused by others. Such images are slow-loading 
              and should never be included in navigation pages within a Web site. 
              In addition, copyright issues may need to be addressed. It is worthwhile 
              including a copyright notice where appropriate, but on-line copyright 
              is an evolving area. Virtual visitors expect images (<a href=#Reynolds97>Reynolds, 
              1997</a>), so low and medium resolution images (which do not print 
              very well, but are adequate for screen viewing) should certainly 
              be included. 
              <p> 
            <li> Use the Internet for publicity, not for direct income generation 
              (yet), although attempts are being made in this area (<a name=Rees97ref href=#Rees97>Rees, 
              1997</a>). Unless you are a very large museum you are unlikely to 
              make any significant direct income from a Web site. There is some 
              hearsay evidence that virtual access increases actual visits to 
              museums. In any case, a museum that intends to embrace the Internet 
              seriously should build up a virtual museum community of both the 
              public (potential actual visitors) and also professional contacts 
              (<a name=McKenzie97ref href=#McKenzie97>McKenzie, 1997</a>). 
              <p> <a href=#Reynolds97>Reynolds (1997)</a> has found that the second 
                most popular reason for visiting a museum Web site (after pursuing 
                a personal interest) is to learn about a museum not in the virtual 
                visitor's locality. This certainly raises awareness of the museum 
                and could well influence a visit if the person is ever in the 
                physical locality of the museum in the future. This would bear 
                further investigation to see exactly how large the effects are 
                in practice. Whatever the influence exerted, it is likely to increase 
                exponentially because of the expansion in use of the Internet 
                itself. 
              <p> Once a Web site is installed, it is important to ensure it is 
                registered with the major "search engines" (e.g., AltaVista: <a target="_top" href=../http://altavista.digital.com/><tt>http://altavista.digital.com/)</tt></A> 
                and Web directories (e.g., Yahoo: <a target="_top" href=../http://www.yahoo.com/><tt>http://www.yahoo.com/</tt></A> 
                and for museums VLmp: <a target="_top" href=../http://www.icom.org/vlmp/><tt>http://www.icom.org/vlmp/)</tt></A> 
                to allow potential visitors to find it. Reciprocal links are also 
                worthwhile with related sites such as similar museums or non-museum 
                sites covering the same subject area. Most visitors to on-line 
                museum arrive via a link from another site, although many also 
                arrive by chance such is the serendipity of traversing the Internet 
                (<a href=#Reynolds97>Reynolds, 1997</a>). Much smaller numbers 
                hear of Web sites through more traditional means of publicity. 
              <p> 
            <li> Sponsorship or support may be possible through one of the large 
              computer companies, but this is probably only realistic on any significant 
              scale for museums of national or international standing. 
              <p> 
          </ul>
          Perhaps most important in the design of a Web site for a museum is the 
          "home page" or location at which most virtual visitors first arrive. 
          This sets the scene and tone for the rest of the site and has a similar 
          role to the front entrance hall of a real museum. It should be very 
          obvious for different classes of visitor where they may wish to proceed. 
          Pointers for tourists, children, teachers, researchers, alternative 
          languages, etc., should be prominently located. The information presented, 
          which may be originally derived from the same or similar content, should 
          then be tailored for that class of visitor, and different aspects should 
          be emphasised as appropriate. 
          <p> For example tourists may wish to know how to find the physical museum 
            and where it is located, including the postal address, information 
            often lacking or well hidden in many existing museum Web sites. Children 
            may want to access on-line interactives in virtual exhibitions. Teachers 
            could be interested in education packs, both on-line and in paper 
            form. UK teachers would probably like to know how the museum could 
            help with aspects of the national curriculum. Researchers may well 
            wish to access the museum's database catalogue if it is available, 
            or to contact a suitable member of staff via email. 
          <p> Other classes of visitor may also be relevant for different types 
            of museum (e.g., hobbyists). Currently the most common reason for 
            visiting a museum Web site is to explore a personal interest (<a href=#Reynolds97>Reynolds, 
            1997</a>). A survey could well help with ascertaining the most useful 
            types of information presentation and a museum could put more effort 
            into more popular parts of their virtual site. Most Web servers can 
            record the number of "hits" per page automatically, and this information 
            could be very useful in determining how the Web site is being used. 
            On-line forms for feedback (similar to more tradition visitor books) 
            are also worthwhile. 
          <p> More surveys complementing that of <a href=#Reynolds97>Reynolds 
            (1997)</a> are needed to gain further insight into the demographics 
            of on-line museum visitors. Ideally a survey of interviews with such 
            visitors would add to the information already obtained via Web site 
            log files and through on-line interactive questionnaire forms. 
          <p> 
          <h2>The Future of Networks</h2>
          Predicting the future of technology is always a hard and error-prone 
          activity where there can be many different points of view (<a name=Wieners96ref href=#Wieners96>Wieners 
          &amp; Pescovitz, 1996</a>). Here we consider some general trends with 
          regard to the Internet over the next few years. 
          <p> Computer networking is still in its infancy, perhaps as developed 
            as personal computers were a decade ago. Different countries are also 
            proceeding at vastly different rates too. Over half the activity on 
            the Internet occurs in a single country, namely the USA. Interestingly, 
            when normalized against population, Singapore lead the world in use 
            of the Virtual Library museums pages (<a href=#Bowen97b>Bowen, 1997b</a>). 
            This is a small country that has decided to embrace networking seriously 
            and has the resources to do it. The country's physically compact size 
            means this has been relatively easy to achieve in a very short space 
            of time. Other countries are also expanding in their network usage 
            at astonishing rates. Brazil's use of VLmp expanded 22-fold between 
            1995 and 1996, outstripping all other countries in growth rate (<a href=#Bowen97b>Bowen, 
            1997b</a>). <a name=fig4ref>
          <a href=#fig4>Figure 4</a> shows the expansion in total virtual visitors 
          using the VLmp resource up to the end of 1997. 
          <p> For the network to succeed, the technology must be as easy to use 
            and ubiquitous as well-established equipment such as the television 
            and telephone is today. A reasonably cheap "black box" that plugs 
            into the wall and works first time is required. <a target="_top" href=../http://www.webtv.com/> 
            WebTV</a> is an attempt at this. Many information provision sectors 
            such as <a target="_top" href=../http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/publishers/broadcast.html> 
            broadcasters</a>, newspapers, libraries, etc., are converging as the 
            underlying technology converts to digital form (<a name=Negroponte95ref>
          <a href=#Negroponte95>Negroponte, 1995</a>). Future black boxes may 
          handle many digital media such as satellite and cable TV, video phone 
          Internet, etc., in a seamless manner. 
          <p> A reduction and harmonization in the cost of communication will 
            occur. However for the moment, communication costs in some countries 
            are an order of magnitude more than those in the US. Telephone lines 
            currently limit the speed of communication significantly. Even ISDN, 
            although digital at least, will only be a stopgap measure in the long 
            run. Cable TV speed of access allowing full screen moving image presentation 
            will be required. A future novel means of fast connection, the infrastructure 
            for which is already widely installed, may be via the electricity 
            supply. 
          <p> In the US local phone connections are often free, unlike most of 
            the rest of the world. This has significantly boosted the use of the 
            Internet in the US since communication costs are fixed for 24 hour 
            access. In the future, costs may well be for volume (and content quality) 
            of data transmitted rather than for the time connected. 
          <p> Faster access will become increasingly available using fibre optic 
            connections and high-speed network protocols such as ATM (Asynchronous 
            Transfer Mode) or gigabit Ethernet (a hundred times the speed of much 
            local area network technology). Network transfer of audio, video, 
            virtual reality and interaction will then be feasible at low cost, 
            assuming that computer hardware speed and capacity continue to develop 
            at current exponential rates. 
          <p> There will be increased access from different sectors. As well as 
            universities which have traditional had excellent wide area network 
            communications, broadcasters, companies, homes, hospitals, libraries, 
            local/national government, museums, newspapers, publishers, schools, 
            shops, tourist offices, etc., are all increasingly providing information 
            for and gaining access to the Internet. 
          <p> On-line charging will become established, providing a mechanism 
            for possible income generation, such as shopping. Micro-charging may 
            allow a small amount to be charged automatically for each page accessed. 
          <p> Security allows the protection of sensitive information. This can 
            be effected using passwords, by the location of the client host accessing 
            the information, etc. Encryption of the data transmitted on the network 
            is possible to help ensure data such as credit card number or money 
            transfer details is only available for authorized access. Efficient 
            and trusted security mechanisms will be essential for the expansion 
            of network use in many areas, especially where financial transactions 
            are concerned. 
          <p> 
          <h2>The On-line Future for Museums</h2>
          <blockquote><font size=+1><em> The world wide web enables you to visit 
            sites around the globe. Stroll through virtual museums, listen to 
            music, or catch up with the latest news ... </em></font>

          </blockquote>
          <p> The cheap and simple availability of network access is essential 
            for the majority of information gatherers who may be potential virtual 
            museum visitors. Schools are still in the process of gaining on-line 
            access and are likely to be voracious users of on-line museum material. 
            Tourists, especially from more technologically advanced countries 
            such as the US, will increasingly wish to check museums facilities 
            before their trip. Currently major potential on-line museum visitors 
            are typically either enthusiasts of the technology or have convenient 
            educational/business access. 
          <p> Virtual visits before and after actual visits are likely, e.g., 
            for school parties. On-line questionnaires could be helpful for feedback 
            on the actual museum visit as well as the virtual experience. 
          <p> The majority of museums are still not on-line, especially among 
            smaller museums. As an interim measure, it may be easier for some 
            museums to provide on-line information en masse, e.g., through a regional 
            museums service or local government administration. Increasingly on-line 
            information will be provided directly from museums, as the technology 
            become ubiquitous, reliable, cheap and easier to maintain. Virtual 
            multimedia exhibitions, including interactive exhibits will become 
            the norm for museum Web sites. 
          <p> Direct income generation will become realistic when cheap and secure 
            charging is available. Most museums will provide on-line shopping 
            facilities, perhaps in alliance with other museums or commercial partner 
            organizations. 
          <p> Comprehensive on-line directories of all museums throughout the 
            world will be available. This is already the case in some countries, 
            such as the service provided by the Netherlands tourist board. 
          <p> Scholarly research based on museum objects will become vastly faster 
            with parallel searching of museum collection databases using standard 
            protocols such as Z39.50. Most preparation will be possible remotely. 
            If it is necessary to see a object physically, this can be located 
            and prepared for viewing before the actual visit, saving time spent 
            at the museum.

            and the Web</em> conference</a> has now been established, the <a target="_top" href=../http://www.archimuse.com/mw97/> 
            first of which attracted over 400 delegates in 1997</A> (<a name=Bearman97ref>
          <a href=#Bearman97>Bearman &amp; Trant, 1997</a>). This is likely to 
          act as a focus for those who wish to keep ahead in the development of 
          improvements in the virtual museum visitor experience in the years ahead. 
          <p> Naming on-line is an emotive issue and is open to change in the 
            future (<a name=Garber97ref>
          <a href=#Garber97>Garber &amp; Korzeniowski, 1997</a>). Currently museums 
          have no "top-level domain" name of their own, unlike companies ("<tt>.com</tt>"), 
          education establishments ("<tt>.edu</tt>"), government ("<tt>.gov</tt>"), 
          organizations ("<tt>.org</tt>"), etc. Domain names can also depend on 
          the country involved (e.g., "<tt>.uk</tt>" for the United Kingdom). 
          For some examples, see some of the "URLs" included in this article. 
          <p> A given museum may be placed under any of these domains, depending 
            on it inclination, or on its Web site provider. In the UK, academia 
            ("<tt>.ac.uk</tt>") and schools ("<tt>.sch.uk</tt>") have their own 
            sub-domains. In the future, museums could establish a worldwide domain 
            name such as "<tt>.mus</tt>", perhaps under the auspices of <a target="_top" href=../http://www.icom.org/> 
            ICOM</a>, or sub-domains in individual countries (e.g., "<tt>.mus.uk</tt>" 
            in the UK). However, this will depend on action by the museum community 
            itself, either internationally or nationally. 
          <p> A benefit to virtual visitors of a more uniform naming scheme for 
            museums could be an improvement in the ability to find a particular 
            museum on-line. A directory such as VLmp (<a href=#Bowen97a>Bowen, 
            1997a</a> &amp; <a href=#Bowen97b>1997b</a>) could be (semi-)automatically 
            generated from such information, and become much more comprehensive 
            and reliable as a result. This is an important issue that museums 
            have yet to address satisfactorily. Exact developments in this area 
            remain to be seen, but it is hoped that the museum community can organize 
            such developments in the future. 
          <p> 
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          At the 1997 UK <a target="_top" href=../http://www.museumsassociation.org/> 
          Museums Association</a> conference, Alex Morrison of <a target="_top" href=../http://www.cogapp.com/> 
          Cognitive Applications</A> posited the following provocative statement: 
          <p> 
          <blockquote><font size=+1><em> Object fetishism is on the way out. Museums 
            will collect and display information, not artifacts. </em></font></blockquote>
          <p> Most museum professional would probably argue against this statement 
            since collections of objects are one of the most important features 
            that distinguish museums from other institutions such as libraries. 
            However the worth of objects without their associated provenance is 
            significantly diminished, and interpreting objects for the public 
            is also an extremely important part of a museum's raison d'etre. Thus 
            museums certainly do need to collect and display information, and 
            the Web is a valuable tool in distributing this to a potentially much 
            wider set of visitors than has previously been possible. 
          <p> If used wisely and sensibly, the Internet is a effective way in 
            which potential visitors can access up-to-date museum-related information 
            conveniently. Maintaining timely information is a costly endeavor 
            and finding the desired information can be difficult in the sea of 
            data available on-line. Automated search using keyword access is effective 
            if the term or terms used are reasonably unique and semantically unambiguous. 
            However, specialized directories created by human expertise will always 
            have the edge over automated means of searching if they are available. 
            In the museum field, one such directory is the Virtual Library museums 
            pages (VLmp). To access this directory on the <a target="_top" href=../http://www.w3.org/> 
            World Wide Web</A>, use the following Universal Resource Locator (URL): 
          <p> 
            <center>
              <font size=+1> <a target="_top" href=../http://www.icom.org/vlmp/> 
              <tt>http://www.icom.org/vlmp/</tt></A> </font> 
            </center>
          <p> Finally, remember that on-line services are complementary to tradition 
            museum services; "virtual" museums will not replace real museums! 
          <p>
