              Mazza</a>, Walker Art Center, USA</h4><font size=3>
            <b><u>Objective of project:</u></b><br>
            <br>
            The objective of the <a href="../http://www.walkerart.org/teenarts" target="_blank">Walker 
            Art Center's Teen Web Project</a> is threefold: <b>1.)</b>To acquaint 
            the selected students with the medium of the web as a means of creative 
            expression. <b>2.)</b>To approach the construction of our web sites 
            with critical thinking skills. <b>3.)</b>To guide the teens toward 
            developing their own individual web sites as a response to the issues 
            that concern them as young adults.<br>
            <br>
            <b><u>Conception of the project:</u></b><br>
            <br>
            The Teen Web Project was initiated by Michelle Coffey, Teen Programs 
            Coordinator at the Walker Art Center. She approached New Media Initiatives 
            with the idea of bringing together a diverse group of teenagers from 
            a variety of high schools in the Twin Cities area and giving them 
            access to the tools necessary to create a web site. Her mission for 
            this teen project parallels the general mission of the Walker Art 
            Center as an institution and, more specifically, the mission developed 
            for the Walker Art Center Teen Arts Council. "To build a space and 
            create experiences where individuals can explore; to ask unsafe questions 
            in a safe place that encourages one to make sense of the world and 
            our relationship to it and to each other. There is a natural relationship 
            between teens and contemporary artists, both a probing and questioning 
            their surroundings, their relationship to society, and the world's 
            relation to them. They are exploring boundaries in hopes of discovering, 
            and perhaps building, their own identities".<a href="#footnote">1</a> 
            With this mission in mind, I was then asked to come up with a syllabus 
            for the duration of the course.<br>
            <br>
            I was suddenly reminded of an article in <a href="../http://www.wired.com/wired" target="_blank">Wired 
            magazine</a> that I had read in the summer of 1996. The article was 
            called "<a href="../http://www.wired.com/wired/4.07/features/kids.html" target="_blank">Kids 
            Cyber Rights</a>" and it was written brilliantly by John Katz, a frequent 
            writer of media and the internet in Wired magazine, among other publications. 
            What motivated me most was his observation that kids and teens are 
            the only group in our country who have no legal civil rights, and 
            that the decisions that were being discussed for how to structure 
            the internet were of great concern to this group possibly more than 
            any other. The focus of his piece was the proposition that kids design 
            a new digital constitution for teens, that they voice their opinions 
            about issues such as censorship along with those who hold the power 
            to make those decisions.<br>
            <br>
            I took this article as the inspiration for the development of my syllabus 
            and began to structure a course that would identify the issues of 
            concern to this class. Once the issues were identified we would then 
            begin to construct individual responses to the issues in the form 
            of "amendments". I was eager to see how a group of motivated, talented 
            and diverse young adults might begin to answer back to the media and 
            the government if they had the forum to speak. The web gives them 
            this forum. Artists have traditionally been the harbingers of the 
            culture in flux, the barometers of the global, cultural climate. if 
            young artists are taught the language of the digital culture and in 
            fact have a hand in creating it, then we have every reason to believe 
            that the web will be a place where the media is spoken back to and 
            looked at with critical minds.<br>

          <td width="450"> <b><u>Process</u></b><br>
            <br>
            In implementing the ideas generated in the conception of the Teen 
            Web Project, I took a decidedly organic approach, that is, I was open 
            to what the process would become. Having never taught a class on web 
            page construction, I was full of ideas but without the practical experience 
            to realize how the course would fall into place.<br>
            In accordance with the <a href="../http://www.walkerart.org/teenarts/tp_syllabus.html" target="_blank">syllabus</a>, 
            I outlined the ten weeks of the course into what we would cover each 
            week.<br>
            <br>
            <b>1.</b> Introduction and viewing of other teen sites.<br>
            <b>2.</b> Defining the issues<br>
            <b>3.</b> Sketches and outlines of individual "amendments".<br>
            <b>4.</b> Scripting HTML<br>
            <b>5.</b> Scanning.<br>
            <b>6.</b> Photoshop workshop.<br>
            <b>7.</b> Creating links from the main Teen Arts site.<br>
            <b>8.</b> Posting the site with links to the student pages in progress.<br>
            <b>9.</b> Finished student links.<br>
            <b>10.</b> Critique.<br>
            <br>
            It soon became evident that the timeline of the syllabus would not 
            be sufficient to fully explore and accomplish the objectives for several 
            reasons:<br>
            <br>
            <b>1.)</b>The class was structured into two-hour stretch in the computer 
            lab at <a href="../http://blake.pvt.k12.mn.us/" target="_blank">The Blake 
            School</a>, a private high school about two blocks from the Walker 
            Art Center. In two hours, we only just scratched the surface of the 
            week's objective. The first two weeks were fine. Discussion and theorizing 
            produced excellent ideas for each project, but when we got into the 
            instruction and practice of using the tools, there simply wasn't enough 
            class time for the students to put the lessons into practice.<br>
            <br>
            <b>2.)</b>The students spanned the continuum of experience and understanding 
            of how the medium worked. Some students had little more understanding 
            of the web than "surfing" while others had already created websites. 
            The task of keeping the class balanced in terms of interest in the 
            material covered proved to be the most challenging aspect. Much like 
            teaching basic math and calculus in the same class.<br>
            While addressing questions of basic HTML tagging, others who knew 
            the answers would begin to stray and create distractions for the others. 
            Any substitute High School Teacher can attest to the ingenious (and 
            distracting) ways in which the students can pass idle time.<br>
            <br>
            <b>3.)</b>The failure to factor in the behavior of ten teen-age students 
            together in a social setting with free reign to the internet in front 
            of each one of them simultaneously was, perhaps, an oversight worth 
            mentioning. At any given moment there were sound clips playing, video 
            clips of exploding whales being viewed with delight, students sharing 
            urls to sites from the Jerry Springier show to the South Park animation 
            series on-line. The upside to this is that we would have insightful 
            and enlightening discussions about each of these sites and sounds. 
            One thing WAS working, and that was their critical minds were at work 
            and they began to develop a language and a context, if only theoretically, 
            on which to base their discoveries on the web, no matter how sensational 
            or banal their findings.<br>
            <br>
            <b>4.)</b>Another unanticipated problem was the Blake School's internal 
            network restrictions regarding students use of external programs. 
            There was one version of Photoshop already installed in the lab and 
            three programs obtained from the Walker Art Center through in-kind 
            donations from Adobe. Even with the additional applications, the computer 
            system at the school was configured to dump any programs at shut-down 
            time that weren't originally on the system. As a result, each week 
            we convened for class we had to re-install programs. This added additional 
            set-up time to our already tight 2-hour class.<br>
            <br>
            <b><u>Lessons Learned</u></b><br>
            <br>
            As a result of the unknown variables listed above, the context and 
            dynamics of the class began to change. I found that the idea of the 
            "amendments", while artistically intriguing, was more refined an idea 
            than the students were ready to address. And possibly too restrictive 
            for and introductory course. I allowed the objective of the projects 
            to develop their own directions. <br>
            As with any creative process, lessons are learned during the practice 
            of creating. My approach to teaching has been organic and reciprocal. 
            What the New Media does most, for better or worse in terms of the 
            classroom, is create new paradigms for learning. The lines between 
            teacher and student are gradually blurring and in that amorphous soup 
            of variability and self motivated discovering there lie incredible 
            possibilities for teachers to learn and students to teach and lead.<br>
            In the Teen Web Project, we began by having critical discussions about 
            the mass media of television, film and print. The common theme I heard 
            loud and clear was that they felt undervalued, misrepresented and 
            unheard. This, I believe, is because what those media don't do is 
            foster input and inquiry. We discussed and listed issues that the 
            students felt were of specific importance to them. Issues that are 
            lost in the majority of TV sitcoms and "Teen" magazines. The crux 
            of the project was, in my opinion and experience, the process of thinking 
            about the media. In this way, the project was wildly successful. The 
            students were beginning to address and respond to issues of gender 
            roles, media control, censorship in the guise of protecting family 
            values. The students were thinking independently and questioning conventional 
            wisdom.<br>
            As artists are actively engaged in overturning conventional wisdom, 
            so too are young adults in teen-age years. Each must do a significant 
            amount of probing, questioning, and provoking in an attempt to find 
            his or her place in society, and to create an individual voice. A 
            contemporary art center such as the Walker is in a unique position 
            to provide access to the arts for teens and has focused its resources 
            on teens, an audience traditionally neglected by cultural institutions. 
            This portion of the class was guided and nurtured by myself and Michelle 
            Coffey. Once the students were prompted to investigate their intention 
            they began to consider their projects more carefully. Once the issues 
            were defined, however, the practice of scripting, imaging, linking, 
            networking and general technical troubleshooting were shared evenly 
            throughout the class. Age and experience barriers melted and we merged 
            into a classroom of experimenters. I am the first to admit that I 
            am as much a student as each of them. It is important to note that, 
            since the websites are a continuing and evolving process, the project 
            was continued on an individual consultation basis, with students scheduling 
            meetings and workshops with myself and Michelle at the Walker Art 
            Center on an ongoing basis. The Walker Art Center Teen Programs World 
            Wide Web Project, I believe, has only just begun.</font><br>
