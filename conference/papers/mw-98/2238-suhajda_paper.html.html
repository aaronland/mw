<font size=-1><a href="#toc">(toc)</a></font>&nbsp;



<p><i><font size=-1>In 1996 the Ministry of Culture and Education began

(together with 11 state museums) the "MA.M.A" Hungarian Museums Database

project.The aim of this project is to establish a searchable artifacts

index database. Each state museum implemented a local network with a local

server plus internet connection. The project designed and developed a database

management system for each museums collection. Over these local databases

we put an index database -called M.A.MA- containing 12 elements available

in each collection. The local databases are stored and maintained on the

local servers, however for security reasons only the well protected central

computer is serving information to the Internet. This central computer

will provide place for individual museum home pages too.&nbsp;</font></i>&nbsp;

<br><i><font size=-1>The M.A.MA database is accessible on 3 main levels.

The first for the public, limited searching capabilities but accessible

for everyone from the internet. On the 2nd level the general database can

be found with free searching capabilities, and the third level is closed,

this is the researchers database, which contains detailed information about

the objects of collections. The project didn't standardize at the level

of the different collections data, but it has attempted to serve provide

for general searching. This paper will present the results of this project

include the solution of the museological problems and the professional

technological background.&nbsp;</font></i>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;



<p><a name="c2"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The aims of the "MA.M.A"

(Hungarian Museums' Database) project </font><font size=-1><a href="#toc">(toc)</a></font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>"MA.M.A" is a multimedia database of artifacts collected

by the most prominent Hungarian museums.&nbsp; The aim of the project is

to <b><i>create a database</i></b> which contains information about historical

relics, art, technical and literary products of the Hungarian nation, which

can be used for scientific and educational purposes and which at the same

time would also help to recognize and better preserve our cultural heritage.A

further aim of the project was to provide at least <b><i>basic informatical

infrastructure</i></b> for the national museums.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;



<p><a name="c3"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The problems of creating

a general museum documentation system </font><font size=-1><a href="#toc">(toc)</a></font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>To create such a system has been a goal of the sphere

of public collections for a long time, but these efforts -although they

had some results - mostly failed.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>Unified way of documentation has been regulated since

the 1950's by law in the Hungarian museums. This has greatly helped the

development of a general computerized register of artifacts, but is much

less useful in the creation of special collection structures.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>Since the systems of object description are varied from

museum to museum, and even between the collections in the same museum,

at this stage of the project our efforts towards a uniform inventory system

are restricted to solving the problems at the level of <b><i>content retrieval</i></b>.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>As a further problem, the <b><i>different nomination</i></b>

of the same artifacts causes additional difficulties in the retrieval.

In order to build up a well searcheable database, we have to face this

problem of nomination as well: in other words we have to create thesauruses

which contain standardized expressions concerning the different types of

artifacts.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><a name="c4"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What is expected of&nbsp;

the system? </font><font size=-1><a href="#toc">(toc)</a></font>&nbsp;

<ol>

<li>

<font size=-1>Our primary aim was to create a public, <b><i>well searcheable</i></b>

database that is <b><i>accessible for everyone</i></b>. Based on this concept

we have defined a so called basic data structure containing 12 pieces of

information. Each collection can provide data to this structure, let it

be a zoological museum collecting butterflies or a technical collection

with steam engines. We have called this <b><i>simple database structure

"MA.M.A"</i></b> which is in fact a common unified index database of artifacts.&nbsp;</font></li>

</ol>



<ol>

<li>

<font size=-1>The second requirement concerning this system was its open

endedness, which means that without difficulties a museum can join later

(applying new collections - adding new description fields).</font></li>

</ol>



<ol>

<li>

<font size=-1><b><i>Easy maintenance</i></b> is also very important, to

be able to allow customization - according to the different needs of museums

- without endangering the integrity of the system. The significance of

this element will be clarified later in this paper when I shall discuss

the physical realization of the system.&nbsp;</font></li>

</ol>



<ol>

<li>

<font size=-1>The next important expectation was to provide a user friendly

client software with minimal hardware background which does not require

special training from the user may it be the museologist maintaining the

system or an virtual visitor.&nbsp;</font></li>

</ol>



<ol>

<li>

<font size=-1><b><i>Data protection</i></b> - as is the case with similar

valuable databases - is treated naturally as a question of special importance.&nbsp;</font></li>



<br><font size=-1>The museums' databases will be <b><i>accessible on 3

main levels</i></b>. The first level is the "MA.M.A" database.&nbsp; It

will have free public access and will contain no more then the 12 pieces

of information about each object which is stored in the common index database,

but the and searching will be limited. The second level will contain the

individual museums' databases with more detailed information. These databases

are protected by passwords, it is the right of the individual museum to

grant access to the password. However, there is read-only access to the

data provided.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<br><font size=-1>The third is the level of researchers' database, where

a double key protection system is applied, which provides access and the

right of modification only to authorised users.&nbsp;</font></ol>

<font size=-1>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><a name="c5"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The realization of the

project</font> <font size=-1><a href="#toc">(toc)</a></font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>At the end of 1996 the Hungarian Ministry of Culture and

Education started to develop the informatical systems of the national museums.&nbsp;

This was the starting point of the "MA.M.A" project (Hungarian Museums'

Database) involving the following 13 museums:&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<ol>

<li>

<b><font size=-1>Museum of Applied Arts&nbsp;</font></b></li>



<li>

<b><font size=-1>Hungarian National Gallery&nbsp;</font></b></li>



<li>

<b><font size=-1>Hungarian National Museum&nbsp;</font></b></li>



<li>

<b><font size=-1>Hungarian Institute of Theatre History/Hungarian Museum

of Theatre History&nbsp;</font></b></li>



<li>

<b><font size=-1>National Museum of Science and Technology&nbsp;</font></b></li>



<li>

<b><font size=-1>National Library and Museum of Pedagogy&nbsp;</font></b></li>



<li>

<b><font size=-1>Hungarian Museum of Literature&nbsp;</font></b></li>



<li>

<b><font size=-1>Open Air Museum of Ethnography&nbsp;</font></b></li>



<li>

<b><font size=-1>Museum of Fine Arts&nbsp;</font></b></li>



<li>

<b><font size=-1>National Museum of Natural History&nbsp;</font></b></li>



<li>

<b><font size=-1>Museum of Ethnography</font></b></li>



<li>

<b><font size=-1>Budapest Historical Museum&nbsp;</font></b></li>



<li>

<b><font size=-1>Museum of Agriculture</font></b></li>

</ol>

<font size=-1>These museums house the vast <b><i>majority of the Hungarian

cultural heritage</i></b> and art treasures such as the Hungarian Crown,

the Corvinas manuscripts and many other unique art treasures.The number

of the objects preserved in their collection is remarkable high, approximately

<b><i>20 million items</i></b>. Similarly sized collections exist only

in the biggest of the museums in the County network.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>The project can be participated in&nbsp; by any of the

public collection, <b><i>admission is open</i></b> to all.&nbsp; All <b><i>"MA.M.A"

services are free</i></b> of charge for participants, who receive their

own home page on the "MA.M.A" server and software to build and maintain

their databases. In return it is the task of the individual museums to

digitalize and make their databases permanently available.&nbsp; To date

the program has been financed totally by the state - the National Museums

are entirely funded from the Budget.&nbsp; Private collections and those

maintained by local governments have the difficult task of providing the

necessary informatical infrastructure, consequently the upgrading of their

own documentation system, and preparation of their individual "MA.M.A"

version attracts a smaller fee.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<br><font size=-1>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<br><font size=-1>One of the most complicated tasks of the project has

been the creation of the <b><i>unified data structure</i></b> accepted

by all institutions involved, as each of the participating museums had

different approaches to this problem. There were museums which would have

liked to issue only 3 items of information about the objects in their colections,

which would have made adoptation of the system practically impossible,

whilst another museum would have freely agreed to total access to their

whole documentation.We could characterize the common database structure

as a solution of compromise. All museums involved provide the data specified

on the common index database, although not all data will be searchable

in the public system.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<br><b><font size=-1>3. Collections&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;

<br><b><font size=-1>7. Register of Names&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;

<br><font size=-1><b>8. References (publications)</b>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>During the physical creation of the system we took into

account new technology suitable for the publication of databases on the

internet.&nbsp; For this reason we chose the new database handler by <b><i>ORACLE</i></b>,

particularly useful when dealing with large multimedia databases.&nbsp;

Publication of the database is facilitated by the <b><i>ORACLE Application

Server</i></b>, whilst client software is provided in the form of <b><i>Netscape

Communicator</i></b> (luckily received free of charge).&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><a name="c8"></a><font size=-1>The table below illustrates the <b><i>physical

structure of the MA.M.A</i></b> system:&nbsp;</font> <font size=-1><a href="#toc">(toc)</a></font>&nbsp;



<p><a href="Struct.gif"><img src="STR.JPG" border=0 height=234 width=200></a>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>There are 2 SUN servers at the MA.M.A Centre.&nbsp; The

database server is a <b><i>SUN Ultra 450</i></b> machine, which is the

most advanced machine ever used by a museum in Hungary.&nbsp; This machine

hosts the joint index database of all the participating museums, and the

individual databases of those museums which do not have a suitable server

of their own for the servicing of their databases. This machine is shielded

and protected from the outside world by a <b><i>firewall system</i></b>

which also prevents unauthorized access. Authorization will be provided

by <b><i>Netscape Certificate's Server</i></b>.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<br><font size=-1>The database server can only communicate with one other

machine from the outside of the firewall.&nbsp; This is a smaller capacity

<b><i>SUN Ultra 1</i></b> server. This machine will be the web server,

the only server visible for outside visitors. This server will not store

any data, its task is to forward requests to the database server which

in return will only transfer back data found for the particular request.

The webserver will also store forms necessary for the use of the collections

of the various museums as well as the downloading and maintenance software

supporting these forms. Data entered on these forms will then be utilised

by the ORACLE Application Server program to generate the tables or html

pages that will eventually appear on the end users's screen.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<br><font size=-1>The client program itself operates in a regular internet

browser environment, apart from a password, a user needs nothing else to

start work.&nbsp; After logging on the MA.M.A server and entering a valid

password, a program module containing the dataforms of the requested museum

will be downloaded on the user's computer.&nbsp; As the client application

is used for the maintenance of the database as well as the search function,

the more complex functions are provided by the use of JAVA scripts and

applets.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>All participating institutions have their own NT or UNIX

operation system servers and have the ORACLE Workgroup Server and the Application

Server appropriate licences.&nbsp; The key concept of the system is that

the local servers use the <b><i>same applications</i></b> as the main,

central server, the only restriction being is that they&nbsp; can only

access dataforms of the requested institution.&nbsp; All structural changes

are first to be registered with the central server, which will then automatically&nbsp;

syhchronise and update the application used on the local server of the

institution which requested the changes. This way it is possible to ensure

the <b><i>uniformity of the index database</i></b> which has the advantage

that if a researcher outside of Hungary (naturally who possesses a valid

password) wishes to use the system, via the central server it is possible

to access the data system of the researcher's own local collection.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>As the individual institutions are&nbsp; presently lacking

firewall protection and the configuration of the servers is still under

way, the decision was made that the databases would <b><i>only be served

through MA.M.A central server</i></b>.&nbsp; In time and with the development

of appropriate protection these functionns can be taken over by the individual

institutions and MA.M.A would only provide the index database, acting as

a type of compass for browsers.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>Maintainence of the Museum databases can be undertaken

both on the local servers and on the MA.M.A server also.&nbsp; As exactly

the <b><i>same program</i></b> runs on both the local and main servers

no appreciable difference can be discerned when using the two. Data exchange

between servers is practically automatic, synchronisation of the databases

is programable.&nbsp; This means that new and/or modified data is registered

on the central server, from whence the jointly constructed secondary databases

(e.g: names, materials) return to the individual museum servers.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<br><font size=-1>Consistency is the task of the central server, which

regularly <b><i>replicates the central database</i></b>. The Museums currently

have an Internet connection capability of 64kb/s, whilst the server has

a capability of 128kb/s.&nbsp; If necessary this can be extended to 2Mb/s.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>Database storage of visual and audio multimedia data occurs

according to <b><i>standard formats</i></b> and can be viewed using standard

browsers.&nbsp; We plan to store the image data in the up to now little

used but advantageous .FIF (<b><i>Fractal Image</i></b> Format) format.&nbsp;

This requires however the acquisition of special hardware for the institutions.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>It is also worth mentioning use of the ORACLE CONTEXT

module, which enables the identification and accessability of artifacts

upon the basis of even the smallest fragment of a word in&nbsp; any of

the attached documents (Word, Excel, etc).&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>The MA.M.A centre is presently located in the Ethnographical

Museum, where its operation is overseen by suitably trained personel.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<p><font size=-1>It is essential to underline the real importance of the

project.&nbsp; It is obvious that information&nbsp; technology has reached

the stage where it requires quality information for the manufacture of

newer and newer products.&nbsp; This is an ideal moment for the Museums

to profit from the situation, yet at the same time certain dangers have

also appeared.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<br><font size=-1>Should the Museums appear on <b><i>digital culture markets</i></b>

as important content providers then they may acheive a much <b><i>better

position</i></b> for themselves and won't be without a share of the spoils&nbsp;

either.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<p><a name="c133"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Future and Aims

of MA.M.A</font><font size=-1>&nbsp;</font> <font size=-1><a href="#toc">(toc)</a></font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>A database containing valuable cultural material has a

right to exist.&nbsp; Its existence is not primarily determined by economic

considerations but rather is of great importance to the fields of <b><i>education

and research</i></b>.&nbsp; It is not without importance either the fact

that such a small country as ours can appear on the internet, bringing

together those interested, being able to introduce them to the country's

riches, to our&nbsp; past and present, perhaps even through a visit to

a virtual museum.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>Presently we have no knowledge of similar european projects

aiming to unify country size public collections.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<br><font size=-1>In 1996 Hungary signed the EU initiated "<b><i>Multimedia

Access to Europe's Cultural Heritage</i></b>" memorandum of understanding.&nbsp;

We would like to<b><i> participate</i></b> within this large project as

a smaller independent project.&nbsp; It is important to discover new sources

- here we are not thinking of technological - to assist us in building

our databases and <b><i>making our system multilingual</i></b>.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;



<p><font size=-1>We intend to continue operating our services <b><i>free

of charge</i></b>.&nbsp; In the future however downloading of higher quality

images and sections of film and audio will become chargeable.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

Web '98" conference is the international debut for MA.M.A.&nbsp; At the

time of writing the loading of information into the database is taking

<p><font size=-1>Hungary is preparing for the <b><i>Millenium celebrations

of the State in 2000.</i></b>&nbsp; The country would like to celebrate

and begin the 21st century in a fitting manner.&nbsp; We hope that our&nbsp;

project can contribute to the preservation and introduction of our country's

past and present to the entire world.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;

<br><font size=-1>We would like to extend an <b><i>invitation to visit

Hungary</i></b> for the celebrations of 2000, either in person or virtually

through MA.M.A.</font>&nbsp;
