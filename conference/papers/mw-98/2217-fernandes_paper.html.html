            <ol>
              <font size=-1>Providing access through the Internet to a 3D environment 
              of an Art Gallery is just one of the components of this project.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>This project has three major components. The first 
                provides a 3D interactive editor for the gallery staff to help 
                them previewing the disposition of the art objects in the gallery. 
                With the help of the editor the gallery's staff can arrange not 
                only the art objects, but also the lighting, sound, and some other 
                details. A second component brings the virtual exhibition to the 
                Web, with the virtual and the real exhibitions opening at the 
                same time. The Web exhibition attempts to resemble as much as 
                possible the real one, including sound conditions and the lighting 
                according to the current time.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>It is however the third component of this project 
                which is perhaps the most innovative: this is an interactive exhibition 
                builder for the Web which provides net surfers the possibility 
                to build their own exhibition. With this simulator the user will 
                be able select the art objects to include amongst a selection 
                from the gallery, or their own work, and their disposition, the 
                lighting conditions including the number of lights, their position, 
                orientation and intensity. Sound is also contemplated providing 
                the user with the ability to change the ambient music. The users 
                can then submit their own exhibition to the gallery for appreciation. 
                The main goal of this component of the project is to bring the 
                gallery closer to the community. Furthermore, this component allows 
                the Art Gallery to open a "Exhibition Designer" competition for 
                net surfers in which they would submit their own exhibition for 
                appreciation. The selected virtual exhibition could then be replicated 
                as a real one.</font>
            </ol>
            <font size=+1><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2.&nbsp;<a name="s2"></a></font><b><font face="Arial">Introduction</font></b></font> 
            (<a href="#toc">toc</a>)&nbsp; <ol><font size=-1>This project started 
            out as a modeling experiment of a real Art Gallery using VRML 2.0 
            so that it could be seen on the Internet.</font>&nbsp; 
            <p><font size=-1>VRML stands for Virtual Reality Modeling Language. 
              This denomination can be misleading in the sense that Virtual Reality 
              is usually associated with immersive systems which is not necessarily 
              the case with VRML. Furthermore, the modeling primitives in VRML 
              are not comparable in extent and flexibility to those present in 
              3D modeling packages.</font>&nbsp; 
            <p><font size=-1>VRML is mainly a language which allows one to define 
              a 3D world to be viewed on the Internet with real time navigation. 
              Currently on version 2.0, besides providing modeling capabilities, 
              VRML also provides primitives for interaction as well as defining 
              animation.</font>&nbsp; 
            <p><font size=-1>The shortage of graphical primitives in VRML 2.0 
              when compared to commercial 3D packages is due to the real time 
              navigation feature in a 3D scene, i.e. only those primitives which 
              were fast enough were included. Also some graphical primitive's 
              features usually found in 3D packages to provide a high degree of 
              realism were simplified for performance's sake.</font>&nbsp; 
            <p><font size=-1>Performance is therefore a main issue when modeling 
              3D worlds with VRML. The performance problem is increased by the 
              fact that, due to the availability of this project on the Internet, 
              the 3D models can be viewed in a wide range of hardware architectures, 
              from slow to super fast computers. There had to be a possibility 
              for those with slower machines to enjoy the 3D model, and at the 
              same time, for the better equipped ones, to take advantage of the 
              faster hardware configurations. Some of the solutions found are 
              presented in section 3.</font>&nbsp; 
            <p><font size=-1>Although we tried to build a model which was as realistic 
              as possible, at the same time we enjoyed the freedom of building 
              a virtual world. Extending reality to provide multiple exhibitions 
              was one of the options explored. In order to achieve this an 8 floor 
              building was created, in each floor a different exhibition is presented. 
              An elevator was added to the model, replacing the real door, to 
              allow the user to travel between floors. This is described in more 
              detail in section 4.</font>&nbsp; 
            <p><font size=-1>Another objective of this project was to provide 
              information to the user in a non textual way. The visual and audio 
              clues defined not only provide information about the timetable, 
              and the time of day but also enhance the realism of the virtual 
              model. See section 5 for more details on this.</font>&nbsp; 
            <p><font size=-1>The project, once concluded, is to be delivered to 
              the Gallery staff. Therefore the process of creating a new Exhibition 
              has to be as intuitive as possible, just like hanging paintings 
              on a wall. The purpose of the Exhibition manager is two fold: to 
              allow the Gallery staff to build their own virtual exhibitions for 
              the web, and also to help the staff to build the real exhibition.</font>&nbsp; 
            <p><font size=-1>To create an Exhibition an hybrid application using 
              HTML, with Javascript, and VRML was developed. The Javascript deals 
              with the information and exact positioning of the paintings and 
              spotlights to be included in an exhibition, whereas the VRML allows 
              the visual positioning of these items interactively in the gallery 
              model. This process is described in detail in section 6.</font>&nbsp; 
            <p><font size=-1>Finally we proposed ourselves, and the Gallery staff, 
              a last challenge: to allow the gallery visitors to build their own 
              exhibitions, using only an Internet browser with a VRML plug-in. 
              Exhibitions can be built either using a pre-selected set of paintings 
              from the Gallery, or with the visitor's own paintings or photos. 
              In the later case, the only requirement to build an exhibition is 
              to have the paintings or photos available on the Internet. This 
              will allow the Gallery to open an "Exhibition Designer" contest 
              for net surfers in which they could submit their own exhibition 
              for appreciation. The selected virtual exhibition could then be 
              replicated in a real one. Furthermore, this can be used to promote 
              young and less know painters or photographers which would otherwise 
              have no possibility to have a real exhibition at the gallery. This 
              last component of the project is presented in section 7.</font>&nbsp; 
            <p><font size=-1>Conclusions and further work are presented in section 
              8.</font><font size=-1></font>

            <ul>
              <font size=-1>Our initial approach was to use a commercial 3D package 
              with the ability to export to VRML for the modeling task. This approach 
              turned out to be frustrating for two reasons:</font>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <ul>
                <li> <font size=-1>The VRML file size was huge when compared to 
                  a rough estimation of the file size needed to do the modeling 
                  from scratch in VRML.</font></li>
                <li> <font size=-1>Adding interactivity later on proved to be 
                  quite difficult because we had to gain previous understanding 
                  of the structure of the automatically generated file in order 
                  to see how to program the required actions.</font></li>
              </ul>
              <font size=-1>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br>
              <font size=-1>For instance consider the spotlight model we included 
              in the gallery. Below a VRML and a commercial 3D package versions 
              are presented, see figure 1.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><img src="HolofoteMax.jpg" alt="3D commercial package version" height=151 width=200><img src="HolofoteExtrusao.jpg" alt="Using just a text editor" height=151 width=200>&nbsp; 
                <center>
                  <i><font size=-1>figure 1. Two versions of a lamp model. The 
                  left one was done in a commercial 3D package, the one on the 
                  right was done in a text editor.</font></i>
                </center>
              <p><font size=-1>The commercial package version translated the model 
                into a VRML file with more than 23k as opposed to 1k for the version 
                created in a text editor. Furthermore, the commercial package 
                version uses 672 polygons, whereas the version created by hand 
                uses only 49 polygons.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The above example clearly shows that exporting 
                to VRML is not always a good option. The file size has direct 
                implications not only on the download time but in some cases, 
                as in the example above, also on the number of defined polygons.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>For the above reasons this approached was abandoned. 
                A specific VRML editor was also considered, but if animation and 
                interaction is to be added to the model then the currently freely 
                available editors for PC's known to us were not also up to the 
                task.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The interior of the building where the real exhibitions 
                take place is quite geometric and simple, see figure 2. Although, 
                as mentioned before, the graphical primitives in VRML are simplified 
                versions of those present in 3D packages, they were sufficient 
                to easily create a model of the interior of the gallery. Therefore 
                we decided to create everything in VRML without the help of any 
                graphical editors, just with a text editor.</font>&nbsp;

              <p><font size=-1>The modeling process is relatively straightforward 
                as far as the interior's architecture is concerned. However adding 
                spotlights to the model involves some important considerations. 
                The VRML specification requires VRML browsers to be able to display 
                a minimum number of 8 simultaneous lights. Currently most browsers 
                do only the bare minimum to comply for performance reasons. Some 
                engineering was required to define the light's properties and 
                positioning so that 8 lights sufficed.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The main issue is however related to the way VRML 
                treats light. The VRML lighting model is a gross approximation 
                of the real world lighting. The adopted model emerged from a compromise 
                between realistic rendering and speed, with a strong bias towards 
                speed. For instance shadows and reflections were not contemplated 
                in the adopted lighting model. Fortunately shadows and reflections 
                were not critical in our model.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Understanding the way the lighting of a polygon 
                is computed is critical to modeling in VRML. From a theoretical 
                point of view, the VRML specification defines a lighting model 
                which requires lighting to be computed for each pixel. However, 
                with this lighting model and today's hardware, performance would 
                decrease drastically. In order to cope with standard hardware 
                configurations the majority of the current VRML implementations 
                only compute lighting for each vertex of a polygon. The lighting 
                for the remaining pixels of the polygon is computed as an average 
                of the vertex lighting computations.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The implemented lighting model implies that for 
                a particular polygon if no vertices are lit then the whole polygon 
                is unlit. This has major implications in the way the spotlights 
                lit the walls and paintings. If a spotlight is pointing at the 
                center of a wall, and if the light cone does not include any vertices, 
                then the whole wall will be unlit. In order to solve this problem 
                either the angle of the light cone is increased or the wall is 
                constructed as a set of tiled polygons. The former solution is 
                unrealistic in the sense that real spotlights usually do not have 
                a large enough aperture so that a vertex of the wall is lit. The 
                latter solution on the other hand, while providing a more realistic 
                lighting effect, has the disadvantage of increasing the number 
                of computations required to compute the lighting factor, thereby 
                slowing down performance.</font>&nbsp; <br>
                &nbsp; <br>
                <font size=-1>Figure 2 shows the lighting effect of a spotlight 
                on two tiled walls. The smaller the tiles, the smoother the effect.</font>&nbsp;

              <p><font size=-1>In order to provide a more realistic approach we 
                implemented the later model, where each wall is build using a 
                number of tiled polygons. This model turned out to be very demanding 
                on the hardware, requiring a medium high level computer according 
                to today's standards. To allow net surfers with medium low end 
                hardware configurations to visit the gallery a lighter version, 
                where each wall is a single polygon, was also implemented. In 
                this version the lighting is not as realistic, on the other hand 
                it provides a smoother real-time navigation, allowing more modest 
                hardware configurations to be able to cope with the computational 
                requirements.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>We wanted to have both the realistic and the simpler 
                model online. We did not want to deprive users with high end hardware 
                configurations of the more realistic model, on the other hand 
                we wanted less equipped users to be able to enjoy the gallery's 
                virtual environment.</font> <font size=-1>Figures 4 and 5 show 
                the different renderings obtained.</font>&nbsp; <br>

                </center>
              <p><font size=-1>However we did not want to have the users deciding 
                before they entered the gallery, for instance to make an option 
                in a HTML page before actually entering the museum. Defining recommended 
                hardware configurations for each version is difficult due to the 
                number of hardware parameters involved like main processor, graphic 
                cards and memory, not to mention the subjectiveness of the concept 
                of smooth real-time navigation. Furthermore, we wanted to stick 
                to 3D as much as possible. The approach taken was to have a light 
                switch in the gallery to allow the visitor to switch between the 
                two implemented models and choose the more appropriate for the 
                visitor's hardware configuration in an interactive way. The device 
                switches from one version to the other instantly, thereby allowing 
                one to decide in real-time which version is more suitable to enjoy 
                the visit.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Another performance problem appeared when we started 
                adding pictures to the Exhibition. VRML has a nice texture treatment 
                with a considerable set of features and options to manipulate 
                textures. However textures are performance killers. The higher 
                the number of textures the slower and jerkier the navigation.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The first action to deal with this problem was 
                to reduce the file size for each picture. This doesn't sacrifice 
                the quality of the pictures because the VRML window is relatively 
                small to allow for smooth real-time motion.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The second measure was to remove the texture from 
                the walls of the gallery. The walls of the real gallery are painted 
                but have a textured effect, so we did detach the model from reality. 
                Nevertheless the difference is almost unnoticeable and the gain 
                in performance clearly makes it worth while.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>It may seem that removing a single texture, when 
                there are roughly 12-15 paintings in each exhibition would not 
                affect the performance significantly. However the real time motion 
                smoothness has to do with the number of textures which are visible 
                from the current viewpoint, and not with the total number of textures. 
                The wall was almost always visible, whereas, in average, there 
                are only about 2 or 3 pictures in view at any time. Removing the 
                wall texture therefore consisted of removing a quarter to a third 
                of the number of visible textures in average. Furthermore the 
                wall's area is much larger than the paintings area, which means 
                that in average there were more pixels with the wall's texture 
                than with the painting's textures.</font>

            <ul>
              <font size=-1>There is no reason to limit the use of the gallery's 
              3D model to show just the current exhibition. One of the advantages 
              of computer graphics is that once they are done multiple instances 
              can be easily created. Therefore its only natural that one would 
              use the model created to provide more than an exhibition. Possible 
              candidates for this purpose are past exhibitions. There was also 
              a request from the gallery staff: to use the gallery for their ancient 
              photo collections, three photo collections from Braga, a city in 
              Portugal, in the early century, the 30's and the 50's. These collections 
              are not available to the public, so the virtual gallery was a suitable 
              way to present these works which otherwise wouldn't be know to the 
              public.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Other possible candidates are exhibitions which 
                can't take place in the real gallery due to its tight schedule, 
                presently the gallery has already exhibitions scheduled up to 
                the year 2000, that's 2 years from now! Previews of real exhibitions 
                are also on the list of possible uses for virtual exhibitions.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Traditionally the exhibition selection would be 
                done in a 2D HTML page, with links to the several exhibitions. 
                However, as mentioned before, we wanted to stick to 3D as much 
                as possible. One could have a control panel somewhere inside the 
                gallery with buttons to switch between exhibitions. This option 
                was dismissed because it was too 2D like, not taking advantage 
                of the freedom provided by 3D. We wanted to provide a true 3D 
                interface.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The approach taken had a clear and intentional 
                departure from reality. An elevator was created, in the same location 
                where the door is in the real gallery, which would allow the user 
                to travel between exhibitions. In this way we used the freedom 
                provided by 3D modeling to create a virtual 8 floor building to 
                present multiple exhibitions.</font> <font size=-1>Figure 6 provides

                <li> <font size=-1>3 bottom floors, one for each of the ancient 
                  photo collections. These floors were placed underground to emphasize 
                  the notion of a deposit, as mentioned before the photo collections 
                  are not available to the public;</font></li>
                <li> <font size=-1>The ground floor, which is the entrance to 
                  the virtual gallery, contains the current exhibition.</font></li>
                <li> <font size=-1>The other 4 floors can be used at will by the 
                  gallery staff, for instance to display past exhibitions or to

                elevator's behavior as similar as possible to a real elevator. 
                Some of the elevator's implemented behaviors are as follows:</font>&nbsp; 
                <br>
                &nbsp; 
              <ul>
                <li> <font size=-1>When the user gets in the elevator the doors 
                  close automatically.</font></li>
                <li> <font size=-1>Once the elevator arrives at a floor the doors 
                  open</font></li>
                <li> <font size=-1>When the user leaves the elevator the doors 
                  will close.</font></li>
                <li> <font size=-1>The button corresponding to the current floor 
                  is highlighted to help the user to keep track of his/her position 
                  in the virtual building.</font></li>
              </ul>
              <font size=-1>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br>
              <font size=-1>For optimization reasons and to avoid keeping the 
              user waiting for the download of all the exhibitions, only the paintings 
              of the current exhibition are loaded initially. When the user goes 
              to the elevator and presses a floor button the paintings of the 
              respective exhibition are loaded. This may create a delay when the 
              user arrives at a floor because there may be no paintings available 
              at the moment. Nevertheless, in the worst case, when the user visits 
              all exhibitions, the sum of the delays each time the user enters 
              a floor for the first time will be equal to the delay required to 
              download all the exhibitions initially. Furthermore the initial 
              delay will be much shorter than if all the exhibitions were to download 
              when the user enters the virtual gallery.</font>

              <font size=-1>This was a challenging part of this project. The objective 
              was to take advantage of being in a 3D environment to provide information 
              resorting to visual and audio clues instead of direct or textual 
              ways while at the same time enhancing the realism of the scene.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The first task was to let the user know if the 
                gallery was open or closed during the visit. The first approach 
                was to put the timetable text somewhere inside the gallery. This 
                would be a direct textual way of providing the information to 
                the user. This approach was abandoned because this kind of presentation 
                fits much better in a 2D HTML page than it would in a 3D environment.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>We adopted the local gallery time instead of the 
                visitors local time, so if someone is visiting from Canada at 
                7 am the visitor will find the gallery open because the local 
                time is at least 3 hours later, depending on where in Canada the 
                visit comes from.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>To provide this information we resorted to the 
                window shades. When the gallery closes the shades are closed as 
                well. Note that the shades are only translated, not rotated, so 
                the visitor can still see the street in front of the museum through 
                the two large windows.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The closing and opening of the window shades occurs 
                when the gallery closes or opens, respectively, independently 
                of the time the visitor entered the site and the duration of the 
                visit. This was achieved using the TimeSensor provided by VRML 
                to implement a real-time clock.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Because the gallery has two large windows to the 
                street it is usual to see people looking inside when the gallery 
                is closed. The real shades are only fully closed, thereby not 
                allowing one to look inside, 3 hours after the closing of the 
                gallery to the public. The model also implemented this behavior, 
                rotating the shades and blocking the view to the street at the 
                same time the real shades are fully closed. Again this approach 
                was preferred to having a textual information somewhere in the 
                3D model.</font> <font size=-1>Figure 9 shows the different positions 
                for the shades.</font>&nbsp; <br>

              <font size=-1>Furthermore different pictures, taken at different 
              times of day, were used as textures for the window views, thereby 
              providing a more realistic environment inside the gallery. The lighting 
              used to simulate the light coming from the exterior through the 
              two large windows is also decreased at night, and reduced to zero 
              when the shades are fully closed to enhance the realism of the virtual 
              lighting.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Finally, there is a church just in front of the 
                gallery. We thought that adding the chimes would be a nice touch 
                to enhance this virtual experience. Therefore, using the timer 
                defined previously for the shades, we set the chimes to play at 
                each quarter of an hour, and at the hours. We could have provided 
                a clock, either digital or with hands, to provide local time information 
                to those visiting from outside Continental Portugal.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Adding a clock however would imply to add elements 
                which are not present in the real gallery without enhancing the 
                mood of the scene. The chimes, together with the window views 
                and the shades, on the other hand help to set the mood of the 
                real gallery, with temporal information being provided as a side 
                effect.</font>

              the information needed to create an exhibition. In order to ease 
              the task of specifying the location of the images used, a special 
              "image warehouse" is consulted, and paintings are added to the new 
              exhibition by moving each image found to a WWW site containing all 
              the exhibitions. This implies that the only images existing in the

              <font size=-1>To specify the constraints applied to the objects, 
              the concept of placeholder is defined. Each type of object can only 
              be placed in the respective type of placeholder. For instance, paintings 
              can only be placed on walls and spotlights on ceiling gutters, see 
              figure 10.</font>&nbsp;

              <p><font size=-1>These placeholders are always considered to be 
                rectangular portions of a plane, so objects can only dragged in 
                a two-dimensional way, within the dimensions of the placeholder. 
                The object orientation is independent of its position in the placeholder.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>This generic approach allows defining different 
                object/placeholder pairs. Some have already been mentioned: painting/wall, 
                spotlight/gutter. Others can be defined, for instance statue/floor.</font>

              <font size=-1>Apart from the position and orientation of objects, 
              each particular kind of object has additional information, like 
              spotlights’ intensity or paintings names, author and dimensions. 
              This information can be changed in appropriate forms of the exhibition 
              editor, along with facilities for creating and removing objects

              <p><font size=-1>As mentioned before, two interfaces for placing 
                the objects are provided. With the interactive 3D interface, the 
                exhibition designer can move the paintings within the walls in 
                which they are placed by dragging the mouse over the former. One 
                can also drag the base of a spotlight along the gutter, and rotate 
                the lamp in order to point it wherever one wishes, in a realistic

                of objects can be required for some exhibitions. To workaround 
                this limitation, the position of an object can also be controlled 
                in the respective object information form, see figure 12, by directly 
                changing the values, using keyboard input, that define the relevant

              <font size=-1>This is what we consider the most challenging part

              The degree of interaction present on a tour in a three-dimensional 
              exhibition is high. Allowing users over the net to build an exhibition 
              themselves goes far beyond that.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Besides providing for little known or resourceless 
                artists a virtual space for presenting their own work, it also 
                allows the promotion of exhibition contests: the winner would 
                be able to see its virtual exhibition become real within the gallery 
                walls. These contests could be made with art previously exhibited 
                in the gallery, or original work from the exhibitor.</font>

            <ul>
              <font size=-1>By letting ordinary users build their own exhibition 
              the problem of where the resources needed for the exhibition should 
              be located arises. In order to build an exhibition the images of 
              the works must be available on the Internet. This would be a major 
              restriction a few years ago, however presently with so many sites 
              providing free web space this requirement is no longer a limitation.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Using a set of forms similar to those defined for 
                the gallery's own exhibition builder, the user can add paintings 
                to his/her exhibition by providing the url of the respective image, 
                plus the information about the works to be displayed.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The user can create an exhibition in as many sessions 
                as required. Images and respective properties can be added, removed 
                or altered at any time during the construction of the exhibition. 
                The same goes for the spotlights and music.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>When the exhibition is concluded it can be submitted

            <ul>
              <font size=-1>Due to the number of users that can have access to 
              this kind of service, some security measures must be taken. These 
              measures aim mainly to assure the following three points:</font>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <ul>
                <li> <font size=-1>no user can modify another user's exhibition;</font></li>
                <li> <font size=-1>no exhibition can be visited by anyone besides 
                  the creator and the gallery staff until the staff approves it;</font></li>
                <li> <font size=-1>after the approval by the gallery staff an 
                  exhibition can't be altered by anyone, even the author;</font></li>
                <li> <font size=-1>the images and sounds must be available on 
                  the internet during the time the exhibition is made available.</font></li>
              </ul>
              <font size=-1>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br>
              <font size=-1>To achieve the first goal, each user is assigned an 
              identifier and a password. The password authenticates the user, 
              and the identifier is then used to reference his work.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The second goal is a very important one, since 
                the gallery cannot be associated with any kind of activities other 
                than cultural. As the real exhibitions must meet some requirements, 
                so do the virtual ones. Being so, a user can create and edit an 
                exhibition at will, in several sessions if he wants, but for the 
                exhibition to be available to the web community, he must submit 
                a request for evaluation. If the staff considers the exhibition 
                to be appropriate, it classifies it as such.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The third point guarantees that the exhibition 
                that the staff approved is the one which is made available on 
                the internet. It is imperative that the user must be prevented 
                to alter the exhibition without the prior consent of the gallery 
                staff to prevent content replacement, otherwise there is always 
                the possibility that the new contents of the exhibition don't 
                meet with the gallery staff's approval. If the creator wishes 
                to change the exhibition at a later time, he must submit a request 
                to the gallery, which will reverse the process, making the exhibition 
                unavailable to the public and open to modifications.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The fourth point is equally important, an exhibition 
                without images is just an empty building.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>In order to comply with the third and fourth requirements, 
                once the exhibition is approved by the gallery staff, all the 
                images and sounds are copied to the gallery's Web server. In this 
                way not only is their availability guaranteed, but also the contents 
                are not replaceable.</font>

            <ul>
              <font size=-1>Looking back at the project as a whole, modeling was 
              probably the easiest part once the performance problems and VRML 
              limitation were identified and dealt with.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>However this project is not exclusively about modeling, 
                it has to do with exploring the potential of 3D to provide an 
                environment where, although reality is kept to a certain extent, 
                it is also augmented to provide options which are not available 
                on the real gallery. Our attempt to achieve this was through the 
                use of an elevator that allows visitors to visit not only the 
                real exhibition but also past or completely virtual exhibitions.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Providing visual and audio clues for the gallery 
                visitors in a non direct and non textual way was also attempted 
                using chimes and different window views instead of a real clock, 
                and using the shades instead of a textual timetable.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The exhibition manager was probably the hardest 
                part; we wanted to provide an intuitive interface both for the 
                staff museum and for net visitors to ease the process of creating 
                an exhibition. This tool also helps the Gallery staff to create 
                virtual exhibitions to preview the position of the paintings for 
                the real exhibition.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Allowing net surfers to build their own exhibition 
                is definitely the boldest part of this project. Using this feature 
                the Gallery can provide opportunities for young and less known 
                painters or photographers to show their work to the community. 
                Also the possibility of having an "Exhibition Designer" competition 
                can help bringing the Gallery closer to the community.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Bringing the community closer to the Gallery is 
                what this project is about. The objective in modeling the Gallery 
                in 3-D and presenting several exhibitions simultaneously is twofold: 
                first to arise interest in those which can visit the real exhibition 
                and have them visiting the real Gallery more often; secondly to 
                eliminate geographical barriers allowing those that can't visit 
                the real Gallery to appreciate the art work, which otherwise they 
                wouldn't have the chance, in a richer environment than a simple 
                2D HTML page.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>This project can be further expanded to provide 
                an even richer environment. For instance the gallery sometimes 
                has exhibitions with statues, and other 3D pieces. This is an 
                important issue that leads to some research in the area of 3D 
                scanning. 3D artworks could use the floor as placeholder and allow 
                the orientation of the piece by controlling only the rotation 
                of the vertical axis or optionally any of the three axes, although 
                this later option maybe neither necessary nor practical).</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>An alternative to the 3D scanning of an object 
                would be mapping a panorama of the object over a cylindrical or 
                spherical surface. A panorama is composed of several images taken 
                around the object at different angles of fixed intervals. Those 
                images can then be "stitched" together to provide one single image 
                of the object all around or become frames which are changed depending 
                on the position of the observer. Depending on the surface used, 
                the panorama could be made in one or more axes.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>Another possible enhancement would be to create 
                a multi-user 3D world inside the gallery, so that people could 
                enjoy the art works and simultaneously exchange ideas and opinions 
                about it with each other. The author of the paintings or photos 
                could provide a live worldwide presentation of his/her work and 
                discuss it with the gallery's visitors.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>A virtual character could be created to guide visitors 
                through the exhibition, providing the author's view of the paintings. 
                Extra virtual worlds could be created to provide information and 
                mood for each painting.</font>&nbsp; 
              <p><font size=-1>The possibilities are endless and only limited 
                by the imagination...and the hardware, and the bandwidth...</font>
