              Uruguayan and Latin American Art.</p>
            <p>The rationale for the creation of a virtual museum in Uruguay is 
              very much related to the situation of art in the country and its 
              social and cultural characteristics and not only to the impact of 
              Internet as a new medium.</p>

            <p><b><a name="THE ART SCENE IN URUGUAY: LIMIT"></a>THE ART SCENE 
              IN URUGUAY: LIMITATIONS AND PROBLEMS</b></p>
            <p>Visual arts are very important in Uruguayan cultural life. In this 
              respect, both national and international experts judge art production 
              to be one of the county's most outstanding characteristics. Furthermore, 
              Uruguayan art is relevant on the Latin American art scene. Nevertheless, 
              the country's art faces all kinds of problems linked to its socio-economic 
              situation and there are many factors hindering its visibility.</p>
            <p>Uruguay is an exceptional country within the Latin American context. 
              It is small, some 176.000 square km, with 3,137,668 inhabitants 
              (May 1996 Census) and its general situation is particularly favorable. 
              The entire territory is habitable under excellent conditions; the 
              climate is propitious for agriculture and there is a considerable 
              hydropower potential. Within Latin America, Uruguay has one of the 
              highest GNP per capita and one of the lowest levels of poverty, 
              together with a comparatively equitable distribution of income. 
              Over the past few years and particularly since the early 90's there 
              has been an increase in the GNP, an improvement of public finance 
              and a dramatic reduction in inflation. Macro-economic activity has 
              improved and its results are good. Productivity has also increased, 
              particularly over the past two years. Exports have grown, with non-traditional 
              products forming a considerable portion. There is a more equitable 
              distribution of wealth (the most homogeneous in Latin America according 
              to BID (Inter American Development Bank), moderate growth in many 
              areas.,<sup><a href="#1" name="t1">1</a></sup> fiscal deficit and 
              external debt have fallen, salaries have risen and inflation is 
              decreasing, Uruguayan trade has expanded and potential new markets 
              are being explored<sup><a href="#2" name="t2">2</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Uruguay has high life expectancy (almost 75 years), and there is 
              very low infant mortality (similar to that of developed countries). 
              It is one of the most urbanized countries in the world: 89.3% of 
              its population are town dwellers and only 10.7% live in rural areas. 
              The capital, Montevideo, is the largest city in the country, accounting 
              for 44.5% of the total population of Uruguay, which is an exceptionally 
              high proportion, giving the country a very special profile<sup><a href="#3" name="t3">3</a></sup>. 
              From the standpoint of quality of life, Montevideo is also quite 
              exceptional. Inter alia, it has been included among the first three 
              best cities of Latin America as chosen by Corporate3d Resources 
              group<sup><a href="#4"

         name="t4">4</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The population is well educated as education is free of charge 
              and mandatory, the Public University is also free, (and it is the 
              most important university in the country). The adult literacy rate 
              is very high - over 96.5% - and there is a strong well-educated 
              middle class.</p>
            <p>In view of the cultural level of the population, there is a considerable 
              number of culture consumers and art finds a receptive audience. 
              However, exhibitions, museums and art centers are not in a good 
              situation and there is a big difference between Uruguay and the 
              developed countries in this respect. There is a gap between the 
              level of creation, the abundant consumption of culture, the high 
              level of attendance to exhibitions and the budget devoted to museums 
              and collections. There is also a gap between the level of quality 
              and the fertile production of art, the enormous quantity of artists 
              in relation to the population and the very low level of investment 
              in museums, collections, purchase of art and a policy of art in 
              public spaces. There is a contrast between the general situation 
              of Uruguay and the circumstances under which the art scene develops.</p>
            <p>In Montevideo, the capital city, there are many very good exhibitions. 
              The exhibition scene is active, but there are no first class museums 
              and no first class buildings to house them. No museum has ever been 
              built for that specific purpose. The most important museum in Uruguay 
              was created in 1911 and is housed in a building that was originally 
              a Hygiene Pavilion for the International Exhibitions. Later, it 
              became a museum with some renovations made to it, mainly in 1952 
              , 1970 and other reforms the 80's. Museums are generally old, refurbished 
              buildings and most of them are not in good shape.</p>
            <p>Collections are poor, almost uniquely devoted to Uruguayan art 
              and even then, very incomplete. The most important museum in the 
              country (Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales) only has 4.700 works 
              of art, of which very few are on display. It makes very sporadic 
              acquisitions, receives very few donations and few are of real quality. 
              In the past it used to enlarge the collection with the prizes of 
              the National Salons (public contests) but many years ago, this policy 
              was discontinued and there are no more National Salons. It has no 
              budget for the acquisition of new works of art (some are acquired 
              with some extra funding that is always very limited). The scarcity 
              of contemporary collections is particularly evident. For example, 
              over the last 10 years, only some 20 works of art of real quality 
              have been acquired. There is no sculpture garden yet but fortunately 
              it is under construction and next year it will be inaugurated. It 
              will have an area of 3.500 square meters and only 15 sculptures 
              (the process of creating it began in 1989).</p>
            <p>Likewise, there are no museums for crafts, design, photography 
              and video art and no specific collections in these areas in any 
              museum. The paradox is that the Uruguayan production in those areas 
              is very strong. There is no major museum of decorative arts. Most 
              of the museums are devoted to painting, sculpture, drawing, and 
              prints.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, permanent collections do not have much space to be 
              exhibited. The most important museum only has 1800 square meters 
              allocated to the permanent collection - the largest space set aside 
              for Uruguayan art in the whole country. Only 800 square meters of 
              that general area is really in very good condition. Most of the 
              work remains in storage. The second most important museum ( Museo 
              Blanes) only has 550 square meters of exhibition space; a collection 
              of only 3.700 works of art, of which only 150 are exhibited. </p>
            <p>On the other hand there are very few private museums; they are 
              small, housed in reused building and in many cases the situation 
              is not particularly favorable.</p>
            <p>Concerning art centers, the situation is not much better. The most 
              important exhibition center - in terrible shape for years - has 
              finally been renovated. It took three administrations and almost 
              15 years to take this step. Fortunately the renovation was fast. 
              However, the building is not completely finished yet, although the 
              cost of construction is only around 350.000 dollars and it is only 
              a space of 800 square meters. A new Cultural Center is now almost 
              finished, it was also built quite fast but it is again a reused 
              building; the renovation had a cost of about 200.000 dollars but 
              it only has a small space for exhibitions of 100 square meters.</p>
            <p>Local budgets for activities during the year are also very low. 
              For example, in the Municipal sphere in 1998, three museums, the 
              most important exhibition center, in addition to other activities 
              related to literature and art will be allocated a budget of 260.000 
              dollars which will have to cover catalogues, space design, curatorial 
              tasks, organization of exhibitions and competitions. The most important 
              museum has an annual budget of about 70.000 dollars. Of course in 
              these cases additional funds are covered by sponsors, but they are 
              very limited. Sponsorship is very limited in Uruguay because there 
              is a long tradition of public service and there are no real incentives 
              for private aid to the arts.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, although there is a market for modern art and auction 
              houses are very active, there is no market for Uruguayan contemporary 
              art. In addition, there is only one major collector of contemporary 
              Uruguayan art: the Engelman - Ost collection. Most contemporary 
              works of art end up in the artists' studios.</p>
            <p>At the same time, over recent years there have been more publications 
              on Uruguayan art; however these are very expensive, often costing 
              over 100 dollars. Therefore, even through books, Uruguayan art does 
              not reach the majority of the population. Although there is wide 
              press coverage of exhibitions and good attendance, the documentation 
              available is not abundant. Catalogs are relatively scarce, poor 
              in illustrations, have limited editions and soon become out of print.</p>
            <p>The cultural content of Uruguayan college education is very high. 
              Nevertheless the visual arts do not receive the attention they deserve. 
              No B.A, M.A or Ph.D. programs exist in the field of history of art, 
              although Humanities and Social Sciences are well developed in other 
              areas such as History, Sociology, Linguistics, Literature etc. There 
              are no University courses on Uruguayan art history.</p>
            <p>It is true that Uruguayan art is usually present at international 
              exhibitions devoted to Latin American art. In fact, it is very visible 
              at the Sao Paulo Biennial and the Venice Biennial. Uruguay is one 
              of the four Latin American countries that actually owns its own 
              pavilion at the Venice Biennial (since the 50's), a fact that guarantees 
              the presence of Uruguayan art at this event. Nevertheless, Uruguayan 
              art also has problems in achieving visibility on international terms. 
              The country does not have a sufficiently large budget to organize 
              traveling exhibitions frequently. So Uruguayan art is seldom seen 
              in foreign museums, kunsthalle or cultural centers.</p>
            <p>The international art circuits are in the hands of mainstream cultures 
              and First World developed countries. Rarely do we find Uruguayan 
              works of art in the major museums of the USA and Europe. Furthermore, 
              Latin American collections are poor, the budget to acquire works 
              of art is very limited and Uruguayan art is not very visible in 
              the continent.</p>
            <p>When Uruguayan art is found in major international exhibitions, 
              it is usually displayed due to the regard of curators from First 
              World institutions and hegemonic countries<sup><a href="#5" name="t5">5</a></sup>. 
              Another paradox is that Uruguayan citizens do not get to see many 
              international exhibitions of Uruguayan art. Many times the Uruguayan 
              works shown abroad are not exhibited in the country, as was the 
              case for instance with Gonzalo Fonseca's sculpture at the Venice 
              Biennial, the Pedro Figari exhibition at the Sao Paulo Biennial, 
              and the Barradas and Torres Garcia exhibition in Buenos Aires among 
              others.</p>
            <p>At the same time, there is a whole sector of Uruguayans demanding 
              and needing more information on the country and its culture. This 
              is the Uruguayan Diaspora, created during the late sixties (due 
              to the economic crisis which began in 1955) and which increased 
              during the seventies (the main reason was the Coup d'Etat and the 
              military dictatorship between 1973 - 1984). There are some 350.000 
              Uruguayans living abroad (many of them in the USA, Argentina, Brazil, 
              Australia, Israel, Canada, and Italy). They are well educated and 
              maintain strong ties with Uruguay but lack sufficient information 
              on Uruguayan contemporary culture. </p>
            <p>Another problem is the county's top heavy organization and the 
              strong concentration of activities in Montevideo. Most of the cultural 
              and artistic life takes place in the capital city and cultural life 
              is heavily centralized. There is a strong need for decentralization 
              and although some efforts are being made, they are still not enough.</p>
            <p>Funds for art, museums and art centers are insufficient because 
              the country has undergone a prolonged crisis lasting over 30 years 
              from which it is recovering slowly and very recently. Up to 1955, 
              Uruguay had had the most developed economy in Latin America. Due 
              to its political stability, welfare state policies, and economic 
              well being, it used to be known as the "model country" and "the 
              Switzerland of Latin America". However, this ended with a long and 
              serious crisis involving the stagnation of production, foreign debt, 
              uncontrolled State intervention, paternalism, inordinate growth 
              of bureaucracy, permanent inflation and unemployment. Social unrest 
              grew in the 60's, there were constant strikes, violence increased, 
              urban guerrillas appeared, and socio-economic upheaval led to a 
              Coup d'Etat in 1973 and the establishment of a military regime. 
              Democracy returned in 1984 and is now very stable. Uruguay has returned 
              to its traditional system of freedom and constitutional government. 
              From the economic standpoint, the situation of the country is now 
              much improved but until the mid-nineties, when the pace quickened, 
              it has been a slow recovery.</p>
            <p>This is a period of improvement. The country has first order priorities 
              such as health and education and is facing the problems involved 
              in recovering stability and in solving long-term issues. It still 
              has an oversized public sector (for example, almost 70% of Montevideo's 
              municipal budget goes to salaries and the situation is similar in 
              the National Government). This is a heavy burden on the economy. 
              Public expenditure is very high and has to be down scaled, many 
              reforms are needed, and productivity is not high enough yet and 
              investment is still weak. The country is also undertaking a reform 
              and investing in education.</p>
            <p>In this context, art has not been a priority so far. Moreover, 
              although much has been done in the last ten years, and some museums 
              and art centers are in somewhat better shape and have many projects 
              and some more budget to grow, they still face many problems, limitations 
              and shortcomings. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, there is almost no tradition of private support 
              to the arts. Uruguay has a tradition of wide social and cultural 
              services provided by the government. Nevertheless, since the 50's 
              it has not had the economic potential to solve this issue properly. 
              Although the government has been reducing bureaucracy, encouraging 
              privatization and public services' efficiency and intends to reform 
              the central administration and down scale the public sector, there 
              are still many issues that rest on the state. </p>
            <p>In the cultural and artistic area, there are few private efforts 
              and no incentives such as a tax deduction policy. The issue of image 
              marketing for enterprises has not had the same development as in 
              the United States for example and there are scant mechanisms to 
              attract the private sector. The museums do not have a board of trustees 
              and nor a tradition of donations. Furthermore, there are almost 
              no fund-raising policies, nor are there membership policies, or 
              entrance costs, no museum shops and catalogues are usually free. 
              Therefore there are few resources from income and revenues except 
              the annual budgets allocated by the State or the Municipality and 
              those are very limited.</p>

            <p><b><a name="THE ORIGIN OF THE PROJECT"></a>THE ORIGIN OF THE PROJECT</b></p>
            <p>The creation of MUVA is in part related to the frustrations and 
              limitations stemming from certain socio-economic realities and to 
              the constraints of the Uruguayan society. Artists, architects, curators, 
              museum directors fight and suffer but now this virtual experience, 
              in a sense, might help them and offer new ways of satisfaction. 
              Many constraints disappear in Cyberspace.</p>
            <p>A web-museum will not solve the problems of Uruguayan art. Furthermore, 
              the intention is neither to substitute reality nor to usurp contacts 
              with real artworks (I am aware of Jean Braudillard and Paul Virilio's 
              warnings and my dream, as a curator, art historian and as a Uruguayan 
              is that we might have in the future a real state of the art museum). 
              This web-museum is an alternative medium to give more visibility 
              to Uruguayan art and calm frustrations in an another realm - the 
              virtual world - possibly giving Uruguayan art a new place in the 
              world.</p>
            <p>This is one of the reasons for the creation of MUVA, a project 
              that I began in 1996. I had been working for 20 years in the field 
              of art history and since 1988 in curatorial tasks. I was concerned 
              over several issues and had been writing extensively about them 
              and I wanted to try a new medium to give Uruguayan art more visibility.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the creation of MUVA is linked with the local 
              situation concerning Internet. This is a very favorable time for 
              a Web project in Uruguay<b>.</b> Internet itself is growing fast 
              in the country and its consumption in Uruguay is growing dramatically. 
              So to start with, there is a natural local audience for a virtual 
              museum. Uruguay is one of the countries with the largest per capita 
              consumption of Internet in Latin America and there are over 2.000 
              Web-sites. The rapid proliferation of Internet users in Uruguay 
              is amazing, in the sense that it follows First World patterns. Perhaps, 
              to a certain extent and in certain circles, there is even more eagerness 
              to use the medium in Uruguay because of an intense feeling of isolation 
              of the Southern Cone from the centers of intellectual and cultural 
              power.</p>
            <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
            <p><b><a name="THE PATRONAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER "></a>THE PATRONAGE 
              OF THE NEWSPAPER "EL PAIS"</b></p>
            <p>I wanted to create the virtual museum as soon as possible but, 
              knowing the difficulties the country was undergoing, the slow motion 
              of change following a long period of crisis, I was concerned over 
              red tape issues and bureaucracy. Likewise, I was aware that the 
              financial situation of the University of the Republic (the most 
              important in the country) would not allow it to create such a project 
              yet. Therefore, I approached a sponsor, "El Pa&iacute;s" the most 
              important newspaper in Uruguay. The project was accepted, backed 
              and since then MUVA belongs to "El Pa&iacute;s."</p>
            <p>The newspaper has the right profile for this sponsorship. It created 
              its own very successful Web-site and the digital version of the 
              newspaper in March 1996 <a href="../http://www.diarioelpais.com/"

         target="_top">http://www.diarioelpais.com</a> (a prize-winning edition), 
              it has a Digital Department and a Systems and Computer Department. 
              Not only is "El Pa&iacute;s" interested in digital experiences and 
              Internet projects, but it also has a long history of patronage and 
              of creating specific spaces for the arts. This action is particularly 
              valuable because there is no tax deduction for cultural patronage 
              in Uruguay. "El Pa&iacute;s" has made all these efforts on a non-profit 
              making basis. This long history of interest in the arts has constantly 
              been spurred by a clear intuition for patronage. An example of that 
              drive is the prestige of the paper's cultural section, the publication 
              of weekly supplements such as "El Pa&iacute;s Cultural," and the 
              role the newspaper has played in the creation of cultural spaces 
              such as the Centro de Artes y Letras, the Museo de Arte Contempor&aacute;neo, 
              the Teatro del Centro and Ediciones de la Plaza. Similarly noteworthy 
              are the many sponsorships granted to cultural initiatives, which 
              "El Pa&iacute;s" has not neglected nor ignored. This is why the 
              project was accepted and backed with enthusiasm by the Director 
              of the Digital Department, Mr. Guillermo P&eacute;rez Rossell and 
              by the Director of the Board, the architect Eduardo Scheck now President 
              of MUVA.</p>
            <p>With the creation of MUVA, the Virtual Museum of Art of Uruguay, 
              the newspaper "El Pa&iacute;s" continues to broaden its role as 
              patron of the arts. Mr. Eduardo Scheck states that<b>: "<i>There 
              is something inconclusive about the unique emblem of the Portuguese 
              prince, Henry the Navigator. The assurance that navigating is more 
              important than living is fascinating, but navigating where and why? 
              Definitively immersed in Internet with our Digital Edition, we decided 
              that it is time we launched our second vocation on the stormy seas 
              of the Network of Networks: our support to Uruguayan culture. Here 
              you have our first attempt in this sphere: the Impossible Museum"...<sup><a href="#6"

         name="t6">6</a></sup></i></b></p>
            <p><b>The team.</b> Guillermo P&eacute;rez Rossell, formerly Chief 
              Editor of "El Pa&iacute;s", a post he held for almost 20 years, 
              and General Coordinator of the Digital Department, has been a key 
              figure in opening the doors for the museum and stimulate the newspaper 
              to create it. He was one of the first people to understand the possibilities 
              of a Uruguayan virtual museum in Internet. Guillermo P&eacute;rez 
              Rossell is founder in 1996 of the Department of Digital Projects 
              of "El Pa&iacute;s," and is in charge of the Digital Edition on 
              Internet of the newspaper http://<a href="../http://www.diarioelpais.com/"

         target="_top">www.diarioelpais.com</a>. Very enthusiastic about the idea, 
              he adopted the project under the Digital Department and since then, 
              he has been responsible for the General Coordination of the MUVA, 
              a vital element in the relation between "El Pa&iacute;s" and the 
              MUVA staff. His openness to the new technologies led to his responsibility 
              for the deep involvement of "El Pa&iacute;s" in the World Wide Web 
              and its possibilities. He is most eager to discover new technologies, 
              new media; he studies all Internet's possibilities from the point 
              of view of communications and gets the newspaper involved in all 
              kinds of digital projects. Therefore Guillermo P&eacute;rez created 
              a new multidisciplinary team to work at MUVA and became the coordinator 
              of this team.</p>
            <p>One of the most important features of MUVA is the manifold variety 
              of disciplines incorporated in its staff. The staff includes a curator 
              and art historian, journalists, graphic designers, technicians, 
              and photographers, who bring their experience to this new enterprise. 
              One of the most interesting characteristics of this project is the 
              different profiles of the team. I come strictly from the area of 
              Humanities and have been working in the field of art history and 
              in curatorial activities. There are photographers specialized in 
              visual art, two journalists, four architects, two Masters in Physics 
              and webmasters, one graphic and digital designer and experts in 
              computer science.</p>
            <p>In this multidisciplinary working team each person contributes 
              with the best of his or her own area of knowledge and the whole 
              museum is created following periods of discussions and a intensive 
              process of checking everybody's ideas. In a first stage, each member 
              of the team covers the critical points of his own area; in a second 
              stage, everybody looks at each other's critical points, in a very 
              creative discussion. Of course, it is the responsibility of the 
              staff coordinators (the General Coordinator, the Director of MUVA 
              and the editor) to bring these discussions to a successful end, 
              endeavoring to reach the high quality standards that are the goals 
              of MUVA.</p>

            <p><b><a name="THE MUSEUM EXPERIENCE"></a>THE MUSEUM EXPERIENCE</b></p>
            <p>Taking into consideration the shortcomings of the Uruguayan art 
              scene and the possibilities Internet has to offer, MUVA endeavors 
              to display the best Uruguayan art in a virtual realm that gives 
              a strong sensation of reality.</p>
            <p>The idea is to use the Web as an exhibition medium that will recreate 
              the museum experience and to mimic as far as possible the sensation 
              of being inside a building. The guiding principle in this line of 
              thought is the generation of virtual environments closely linked 
              to reality.</p>
            <p><b>The building.</b> MUVA is located in a special building designed 
              by architects, which could be built at any time. This has been a 
              way to give Uruguayan architects an opportunity in the field of 
              museum architecture, among other things. In fact, it is the first 
              time in Uruguayan history that a team of architects has been able 
              to design a new building for an art museum.</p>
            <p>On the other side this is the first virtual building designed in 
              Uruguay and it starts a new chapter in the Uruguayan history of 
              architecture. MUVA belongs to a whole chapter of architecture, "virtual 
              architecture" or "information architecture" (I borrow the term from 
              Larry Burks in his Thesis <a href="../http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/~lburks/f1/research/prep/part_a/m_ab.html"

         target="_top">" Information Architecture: The Representation of Virtual 
              Environments"</a>, Harvard University Graduate School of Design 
              and is one more example in the history of architecture of "unbuilt 
              architectural designs" (such as the ones shown in "Quondam, A virtual 
              museum of architecture" <a href="../http://members.aol.com/quondam001/aboutq.html"

         target="_top">http://members.aol.com/quondam001/aboutq.html</a>) that 
              now have the possibility to exist in the virtual realm. So this 
              project is also a way to stimulate Uruguayan creativity in the area 
              of architecture and design. This potential of virtual architecture 
              has been realized by many, among others by Michael Gough who states 
              " <i>freed of Newtonian constraints, the imagination will flourish. 
              There is an opportunity here that is more conceptual and potentially 
              paradigmatic than anything in conventional architecture</i>". I 
              take the quote from a dissertation that was recently (March 2, 1998) 
              sent to me via e mail by its author: Simon Forestiero's dissertation, 
              "The virtual narrative, can a virtual gallery convey an architectural 
              experience?" (appendix a: <a href="../http://www.mmu.ac.uk/art-des/arc/people/sforestiero/diss.htm"

         target="_top">http://www.mmu.ac.uk/art-des/arc/people/sforestiero/diss.htm)</a> 
            </p>
            <p>The rationale for this creation is that the construction of an 
              art museum such as the outstanding ones in the great metropolitan 
              capitals of the world, would have cost from 50 to 100 million dollars, 
              a prohibitive sum in the situation of Uruguay. A new museum is not 
              even in the long-term plans of the Government or the Municipality. 
              And private museums are small and have not projects of major growing. 
              Moreover, even if it were to be, it would take a long time to build: 
              budgets are always limited for this type of project. As an example, 
              Uruguay's most important Performance and Cultural Center, the SODRE 
              was burnt down in 1971; in 1987, the Government decided to build 
              a new center with a budget of around 70 million dollars. It is being 
              built but at a very slow pace. Started over 10 years ago, although 
              near the end, it is yet not ready and will probably take three more 
              years. </p>
            <p>Thus, the progress in virtual reality and development of Internet 
              has made a great adventure possible: the design of what today is 
              an impossible museum for Uruguay and at least have it in a virtual 
              form. Thus, for Uruguayans the creation of a virtual museum has 
              some specific connotations.</p>
            <p>Four architects were commissioned to prepare the plans for the 
              building and they designed it with DataCAD. The architects Jaime 
              Lores, Ra&uacute;l Nazur, Daniel Colominas and Marcelo Mezzottoni 
              of the firm of Mezzotoni-Scheck &amp; Partners designed MUVA's structure 
              and created a virtual building. They created a fine arts museum, 
              consisting of galleries for permanent and temporary exhibitions, 
              as well as spaces for informal shows, sculpture garden, restoration 
              workshops, and administrative services areas.</p>
            <p>They worked as if they were going to build a real museum. The building 
              area would be in the "real" space of 6000 square meters and its 
              virtual location is the southeast corner of Plaza de Cagancha, fronting 
              on Avenida 18 de Julio, Calle Zelmar Michelini and Calle San Jos&eacute;. 
              It is in the very heart of downtown Montevideo. The building has 
              five main floors and three additional levels, spatially interconnected 
              using multiple heights. The ground floor is connected to the Plaza 
              through an arcade-like transition space, which acts as the base 
              for the upper facade, in turn finished with a false porticoed fa&ccedil;ade 
              enclosing the sculpture garden located on the roof. Volumetrically, 
              the heights and planes prevailing in the adjacent buildings are 
              respected, but contrast is achieved with materials and the large 
              surfaces on which they are applied. The point where the Plaza meets 
              Avenida 18 de Julio is highlighted by a vertical circular tower 
              that rises over the main body of the building, and whose vertical 
              axis is oblique in relation to the orthogonal directions.</p>
            <p>The conception proposes to accentuate the importance of the corner 
              on which it is located, by elevating it above the main block. This 
              idea is reinforced by the inclusion of an oblique axis with respect 
              to the orthogonal directions commanding the composition. The building 
              uses classical corner designs to be seen on Avenida 18 de Julio, 
              the main artery of Uruguay's capital, Montevideo. Among others, 
              the Palacio Salvo, Lapido and Sorocabana buildings, are concrete 
              examples of this trend.</p>
            <p>Another important idea behind the creation of the virtual building 
              is the presentation of art in a spatial context in order to convey 
              a sensation similar to the one experienced in a museum and enhance 
              the visual contact with artworks. These ideas played a major role 
              in the project.</p>
            <p><b>Design and HTML </b>The building, its galleries and hallways, 
              its public spaces and archives have a virtual dimension emulating 
              that "impossible" museum. Design programs and the designers' creativity 
              make it possible to generate surprisingly high-quality images. The 
              architects' plans are the basis for the design of the museum, where 
              elaborate textures of pixels in thousands of colors give shape to 
              walls, stairways, windows, sidewalks, roofs, spots, and virtual 
              lighting. It is a complex yet precise construction endeavor, making 
              the museum's six floors and ground level entirely navigable and 
              enabling visitors to feel as if they were in a "real"-virtual museum.</p>
            <p>Based on the architectural project, the digital graphic designer 
              Mario Buchichio took over the digital production of MUVA. He created 
              the 3D version of the museum. His role was to turn the gray-walled 
              skeleton provided by the architects into a virtual structure that 
              would look like a real building and be credible to its visitors. 
              He generated the structure, which was then trimmed and lit to house 
              the Museum's art works. He took charge of the general decoration, 
              the textures of the walls, the installation of floors and glass, 
              the finishing of the stairways, the construction of the elevator 
              and of the stairs. He had to work in a virtual building, because 
              no photography was used as reference; he computer-generated everything. 
              He always bore in mind ease of navigation so he avoided over heavy 
              images.</p>
            <p>A very important part of this construction process is the interaction 
              with the physicist Leonardo Setaro, to ensure that the design would 
              be compatible with the technique for navigating MUVA implemented 
              by Web2mil <sup><a href="#7"

         name="t7">7</a></sup>. These realistic effects of 3D design are combined 
              with a special use of HTML.</p>
            <p>One of the most critical discussions in the process of making MUVA 
              was in the selection of the technology to put the museum on-line. 
              The decision was between the newest VRML technology, with astonishing 
              virtual reality performance and the more traditional HTML design. 
              On the VRML "side" were the webmasters of the team; on the HTML 
              side were the others, including the graphic designer. The problem 
              was not easy. VRML technology gives the possibility to "move" inside 
              the 3D spaces, walk through, go up and down, but it is a heavy software 
              program, having difficulties in coping with the transmission speed 
              in Internet and the quality of the graphics did not seem to be the 
              best. The other problem with VRML was that users would need a plug-in, 
              a software that must be downloaded and installed in the user's computer 
              and we were aware that average users resist installing a strange 
              software component in their computers.</p>
            <p>Therefore, following a period of discussion, the team decided in 
              favor of HTML. The team opted for HTML for many reasons. It wanted 
              MUVA to be very accessible and to have very good graphic quality. 
              It wanted the easiest navigation possible and opted for a navigation 
              that would not require the downloading of software or plug-ins. 
              In MUVA only a browser with no external applications is needed to 
              enjoy a user-friendly museum.</p>
            <p>Most of the sites in the Net that give 3-D sensation of virtual 
              reality use Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML). To view the 
              sites properly, the visitor needs a VRML viewer or plug-in. Virtual 
              realities are created with different programs, for example, with 
              Bubble Photographs, Quick Time VRML, 360 degree Panoramas, Live 
              Picture, 360 degree Panoramic Images, Quick Time VR but they all 
              required plug-ins. In the case of MUVA, real environments are simulated 
              using the HTML language that is taken to its very limits.</p>
            <p>One of the ideas is to convince the navigator to enter the virtual 
              world of MUVA easily, forgetting about the PC and the browser. Thus 
              MUVA encourages the user to visit the building, enter another reality, 
              have a virtual sensation, live an illusion. The goal is to give 
              the sensation of entering a virtual realm, forgetting about the 
              normal commands and only use MUVA commands. The commands are intuitive 
              and related to the normal movements of human beings. Thus, the commands 
              relate to the sensation of advancing from one hall to the other, 
              to being able to move around an exhibition hall, to go up and down 
              the staircases, to travel up and down the elevators, to approach 
              the information desk and to send messages. The users can rotate, 
              advance and go back, looking at the 3D images that simulate 3D spaces 
              and have to an extent the sensation of visiting a museum and enjoy 
              its architecture and at the same time enjoy the works of art.</p>
            <p>The intention at the same time is to keep things relatively fast. 
              A user with a standard computer and a 28.8 KBPS modem connected 
              to a good ISP can visit the halls quite fast. Each point of view 
              is 26 Kbytes, and if the visitor decides on the eight points of 
              view offered in each hall and a complete rotation, he or she can 
              see the total hall with the rotations in 104 seconds. In 15 seconds, 
              the visitor approaches the walls; zooms to the paintings and sculptures 
              take 50 seconds. (Of course, the speed varies according to the ISP, 
              the time of day, the country and the hardware used, so this process 
              can be faster or slower).</p>
            <p>MUVA tends to have accessibility and thus tries to be a user-friendly 
              Net environment, able to present art on the web in the best way 
              possible. The museum can be accessed with standard equipment and 
              software and it does not have any special requirements except for 
              Netscape 3.0. At present, it can also be visited by the latest version 
              of Microsoft Explorer.</p>
            <p><b>Budget. </b>One of the issues MUVA faces is its budget. We cannot 
              overburden the newspaper, which is fully backing a very special 
              project with no financial return, in a country where there is no 
              tax deduction for sponsorship of cultural projects. We have to bear 
              in mind that "El Pa&iacute;s" is a newspaper and has other priorities. 
              So MUVA has to use already existing human and equipment resources 
              and in that sense, the budget is limited. Therefore, expensive hardware, 
              software or external consulting are not used. In this project, there 
              are no high tech computers, high-end or state of the art hardware 
              and software such as that offered by Silicon Graphics. For instance, 
              the designer uses a normal high performance PC Pentium, a clone 
              of 120 Megabytes RAM and 6 Gigabyte hard drive. His software is 
              a 3D program, that is already two years old and only cost 1.500 
              dollars, while a more sophisticated one would have cost 7.000 dollars. 
              And this software was not specially created to design a 3D building, 
              so he has had to come up with procedures which, so to speak, he 
              has to invent. MUVA is also able to use the scanner the newspaper 
              owns, a Pixel Craft. Thus, more technical creativity is involved 
              and fewer resources are used than would have been the case under 
              more favorable conditions. We all aim at achieving the best results 
              possible in a cost-effective way.</p>

            <p><b><a name="EXHIBITIONS AND CONTENTS"></a>EXHIBITIONS AND CONTENTS</b></p>
            <p>MUVA specializes in one of the most significant contributions to 
              Latin American Art: modern and contemporary Uruguayan art and, in 
              the near future, it will open its doors to other examples of Latin 
              American art. It offers the visitor the possibility of viewing on 
              the home computer, quality representations of the best Uruguayan 
              art and takes advantage of the Web and of a medium that is well 
              suited to image-intensive exhibits of artworks</p>
            <p>MUVA seeks new opportunities for Uruguayan art and tries to give 
              it more visibility. It offers a new venue for Uruguayan artists 
              and wants to increase and improve opportunities for Uruguayan artists 
              to enable them to come closer to the national and international 
              art community. Thus, it fosters recognition of Uruguayan art.</p>
            <p>The role envisioned for the virtual museum is to advocate, support 
              and promote Uruguayan art and provide information on the subject. 
              The idea is to disseminate knowledge about the country and make 
              its resources and cultural heritage more accessible. At the same 
              time, MUVA endeavors to decentralize culture.</p>
            <p>In the interim, it also tries to cover the needs of the Uruguayan 
              Diaspora. It might well be a new source of syllabi for Latin American 
              studies. MUVA hopes to encourage cultural diversity on the Net, 
              and one of the goals we hope to achieve is to attract different 
              profiles of visitors and increase the number of our viewers. MUVA 
              also aims at attracting new audiences for art, for the "real " museums 
              and collections and to stimulate them to enjoy "real" artworks</p>
            <p><b>Openness.</b> As the director and curator of MUVA, my goal is 
              that it should make a broad spectrum of Uruguay's artistic creativity 
              available. One of my objectives is to exhibit all kinds of first 
              class Uruguayan art. The museum is particularly pledged to Modern 
              and Contemporary art and emphasizes its commitment to contemporary 
              visual languages that receive scant attention in Uruguayan museums 
              and is less known on the international scene. There is also a theoretical 
              issue involved: MUVA endeavors to be open to change and innovation 
              in the field of art.</p>
            <p>It tries to cover the art of the masters, the highlights of Uruguayan 
              art and, at the same time, mid-career art and that of cutting edge 
              artists. It launched its policy of exhibitions with a very well 
              known master, Pedro Figari and a cutting edge artist, Javier Bassi, 
              and has continued with this policy to order to give an opportunity 
              to the young in a country that does not provide many.</p>
            <p>MUVA has openness to a variety of forms, styles and media. It displays 
              prints, collages, paintings and an installation, sculptures, photography 
              of different periods and styles: Modern, Contemporary, cutting edge<b>. 
              </b>One of my ideas and one of MUVA's main characteristics is to 
              make it possible to get to know little-explored, often almost inaccessible 
              areas. It allows viewers to reach works in artists' studios and 
              in private collections, ranging from the youngest artists to the 
              masters.</p>
            <p>In the process of the curatorial work and decisions that lie in 
              my hands, I visit private collections and artist's studios, make 
              the selection of the artworks that are more interesting and that 
              are not exhibited frequently or that have never been exhibited. 
              Then I write the texts, build the bibliography and write the biographies.</p>
            <p>As a next step, the editor and the photographers go to the collections, 
              take the pictures, which are then scanned. The photographers take 
              care of the first stage of every movement in MUVA; they go to the 
              homes of private collectors and to artists' studios to take the 
              pictures of the paintings for the exhibitions. Working in private 
              homes and artist's studios in Uruguay and with the equipment the 
              photographers have, does not always provide ideal conditions for 
              a good photographic job: lack of light, the impossibility of moving 
              the paintings to better places (for example, photographic studios), 
              and shortness of time, makes it essential to consider all the conditions 
              and try to find the best solution. About 20 percent of the paintings 
              and sculptures do not fulfill the ideal technical conditions for 
              inclusion in the exhibitions and are discarded at this first stage.</p>
            <p>The editor works in the coordination of the on-line construction. 
              He accompanies the photographer, watches the process, and takes 
              notes of the problems that can be corrected later. He also works 
              with the curator, trying to establish what would be, for example, 
              the best order of the selected paintings in the building's room 
              in order to achieve the highest possible visual impact. He oversees 
              the scanning of the images, the editing of the specific and general 
              texts written by the curator and he, the webmaster and the director, 
              keep searching for involuntary programming mistakes (every exhibition 
              involves hundreds of links and hypertext).</p>
            <p><b>The discourse and practice of a museum. </b>This task lies in 
              my hands since I am the curator and art historian of the team<b>. 
              </b>MUVA tries to maintain the discourse and practice of museum 
              exhibition as regards classification, context, understanding of 
              the viewers and reception. Concerning information, a considerable 
              amount has been put on line about the artists and the images. MUVA 
              aims at creating a substantive commentary on the works and their 
              historical and aesthetic context because we think that this is a 
              very important characteristic of any good museum on the Web.</p>
            <p>It includes the normal information given by museums regarding the 
              works of art, (title, date, and size, technique, medium, and location) 
              plus explanatory texts, texts about the historical and cultural 
              context and references to schools, styles, or periods that the works 
              of art represent. Biographies and bibliographies are also included. 
              We also attempt to include personal statements by the artists, particularly 
              in the case of young or cutting edge ones; I do not want to be an 
              hegemonic curator. Thus, for instance in the case of Javier Bassi, 
              a budding artist, I write about his work but he is also given the 
              opportunity to speak about his aims, techniques, the reason he chooses 
              certain materials: he has his own voice. We also want to introduce 
              the visitor to the image of the artist himself and his studio. In 
              the case of Javier Bassi both are included and there is a photograph 
              of the place in which he works and lives. In other cases, such as 
              that of Luis Solari, we were able to refine the option. MUVA displays 
              an illustrated report made by one of our best photographers Panta 
              Astiazaran, who has been given a special exhibition space to hang 
              pictures he took of Solari, his studio and his private museum over 
              the last 20 years of his life.</p>
            <p><b>Content.</b> We wish to balance the possibility of reaching 
              a large number of viewers, while keeping in touch with a group more 
              specialized in taste and knowledge. We do not want neglect one of 
              the most interesting dimensions of Internet: the possibility of 
              reaching enormous numbers of people globally. Furthermore, one of 
              our goals is to attract more people to art, to art appreciation 
              and to Uruguayan art in particular. Decisions become difficult regarding 
              the intellectual level of the texts and this remains a matter of 
              discussion among the team. Eventually we usually decide on a rather 
              broad coverage, suitable for undergraduates and graduates and at 
              the same time try to prepare messages that can also be enjoyed by 
              a more general type of visitor.</p>
            <p><b>Authorship. </b>MUVA is a provider of original content, written 
              specially for it by a professional art historian whose biographical 
              data is on line. We are aware of the difficulties of ascertaining 
              the authority behind Web sites so we include all kinds of information. 
              Anyone can check the credentials and verify the qualifications of 
              the director and author of the texts and of the members of the team. 
              In the event the visitor wishes to have more information, there 
              is a permanent opportunity to communicate through e-mail, different 
              pages provide the possibility to contact us and the team always 
              answers the mail.</p>
            <p>MUVA provides wide information on the museum itself in the section 
              Info. Every detail is explained so the visitor has information about 
              the purpose, the origin of the idea, the authorship, message from 
              the director, resume of the director, message by the sponsor, the

              LITERACY</b></p>
            <p>MUVA takes into consideration that there are varying degrees of 
              on-line literacy. It has two help sections. One is quite lengthy 
              and the other very practical, short and explicit. In the shorter 
              Help section, navigation methods are clearly stated and easy to 
              follow, explained and shown in detail and we endeavor that the museum 
              should become a user-friendly site. In the longer version, many 
              more details are explained in depth. We try to invite new users 
              to feel comfortable with the new technologies and avoid alienating 
              them.</p>
            <p>There is a virtual office for messages through e-mail and at the 
              end of almost every page there is also the e-mail address with an 
              on-line connection, so we are continuously open to messages, which 
              we always answer. In fact, we receive dozens of letters every day.</p>
            <p>MUVA has a News section to keep the visitor informed about changes 
              and has created a subscription form for a Newsletter (this is not 
              ready yet). MUVA endeavors to have as many internal links as possible 
              and it also offers off-site links.</p>

            <p><b><a name="ACCESSIBILITY FOR SPANISH SPEAK"></a>ACCESSIBILITY 
              FOR SPANISH SPEAKING AND NON-SPANISH SPEAKING VISITORS</b> </p>
            <p>The team decided to make the museum accessible to as vast an audience 
              of viewers as possible. Therefore one month after the launching 
              we duplicated the whole site in English. It is not an easy task 
              for a virtual museum in a peripheral country to be visible. Internet 
              is not exactly a cyber-democracy; English language sites are predominant, 
              as is the presence of First World countries, particularly the United 
              States. Therefore, we also have to cope with the hegemonic countries 
              in the Web.</p>
            <p>We have an average 40% of visitors from Uruguay and many visitors 
              are Uruguayans living abroad. According to e-mails received, hundreds 
              of very nostalgic Uruguayans living abroad are eager to see Uruguayan 
              art and discover new artists. The rest are visitors from all over 
              the world. The fact that the site is also in English enables access 
              by a great number of visitors from the USA - the second country 
              registered as our visitor - several countries in Europe, Japan, 
              Asia, in a total of 25 countries per day and around 60 per moth. 
              The countries vary according to the days<sup><a href="#8" name="t8">8</a></sup></p>

            <p><b><a name="FEEDBACK AND VISIBILITY"></a>FEEDBACK AND VISIBILITY</b></p>
            <p>For a relatively new virtual museum in a small country in the Southern 
              Hemisphere and considering it belongs to a very peripheral culture, 
              MUVA has already achieved considerable visibility<b>. </b>One advantage, 
              is that it is advertised in the first page of the digital edition 
              of the newspaper and has a direct link from there so many readers 
              of the digital edition discover MUVA in this way. Press coverage 
              in Uruguay is very good; we have had many radio interviews, articles 
              in magazines and newspapers, interviews on TV, so the local audience 
              is well aware of the existence of the museum.</p>
            <p>International attention is more difficult to attract but MUVA has 
              had very important help: CNN International interviewed us and filmed 
              the museum and released the interview many times in the Spanish 
              and English editions of the program all over the world. Brazilian 
              TV from Rio Grande do Sul filmed MUVA and interviewed us and they 
              transmitted the program on Cable TV 8 times</p>
            <p>Although we still have a long way to go and know that obtaining 
              more visibility is not an easy task, we are quite pleased that MUVA 
              has been selected, reviewed or given attention by important web-sites 
              related to art and culture. In Uruguay, the major educational web-sites 
              such as the University of the Republic, ANEP -CODICEN (Uruguayan 
              National Council of Education) and the Association of High School 
              Teachers Web-site include or recommend MUVA.</p>
            <p>In Europe and the United States MUVA is also included and some 
              times recommended or reviewed by educational and cultural Web-sites. 
              Among others, mention can be made of ICOM, ALAA (Association of 
              Latin American Art), LANIC of the University of Texas at Austin, 
              World Wide Art Resource, University of Wisconsin, Voice of the Shuttle,

            <p>At the same time, MUVA has also received awards. Among the 27 awards 
              received, I would like to mention the ones given by Gar, The Web 
              of Culture, The Education Index: Top Site and the Critical Mass

            <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
            <p><b><a name="NEXT STEPS"></a>NEXT STEPS </b></p>
            <p>The team is discussing several issues, plans and projects to be 
              implemented in the next few months:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>The problem of the audience.</b> Right from the beginning, 
                we had an implicit notion of the audience. However, it is evident 
                that it is very difficult to assess the type of audience we really 
                have. We are still not knowledgeable enough about the exact profile 
                of our visitors. It is difficult to ascertain to whom the display 
                is addressed, but in this task, the e-mail has been of great assistance 
                and we now know much more. We communicate with almost every visitor 
                that writes to us and ask him or her some questions. We have had 
                an encouraging audience response and have been quite successful. 
                Through this procedure at least we now have a profile of the visitor 
                who writes to us. According to the letters and correspondence 
                maintained by e-mail I have discovered that most of those who 
                write to us are educated, mature, generally graduated from college 
                and visitors of other museums, both real and virtual. They are 
                not experts on art but college educated people with an interest 
                in humanities and culture. The correspondence will be continued 
                and we will probably create another more formal method of assessing 
                the audience profile. 
              <li><b>Approach to new audiences</b>. We want to<b> </b>create some 
                form of more active participation and open up to the voice of 
                the "Others" and not only to the curator or the artist, thus integrating 
                the discourse of the non-specialist in the museum. At the same 
                time, we would like to create new attractions to approach segments 
                of people that have not yet experienced art. 
              <li><b>Open doors to new creativity. </b>In the near future, we 
                wish to open up new spaces for digital art, video art and Internet 
                art and new lines of creativity. We would like to have work commissioned 
                specially for the new medium. 
              <li><b>The challenges of a new curatorial task.</b> There are specific 
                curatorial training needs for virtual museums that have not yet 
                been solved in Uruguay and we will have to face this issue. The 
                curators of Internet and interactive multimedia need special skills. 
                My own experience teaches me that there is a lot to learn, many 
                issues that require deep thinking and discussion and I am facing 
                a whole new realm that forces me to enrich my knowledge of Internet 
                and face theoretical and practical issues. In the course of this 
                new challenge of directing an on-line museum and while the museum 
                is growing, I am becoming more informed about theoretical issues, 
                that involve a discussion of the medium from experts like Baudrillard, 
                Virilio, Howard Rheingold, among many others<sup><a href="#9" name="t9">9</a></sup>. 
                I am discovering aspects of a new world that I had not done research 
                on and I still have a great task to accomplish in that area<sup><a href="#10" name="t10">10</a></sup>. 
                At the same time, I want to be able to share my experience and 
                invite guest curators to become more familiar with the new media. 
                This is one of the "cyber-challenges". 
              <li><b>The browser. </b>The webmaster opted for Netscape 3.0 for 
                the whole project and achieved great results, but of course, it 
                is somewhat of a limitation although, presently, the latest version 
                of Explorer enables the visitor to see MUVA quite well. At all 
                events, we will have to face this issue in the future because 
                we should be equally accessible both to browsers or to any type 
                of browser. We are conscious of this problem and are faced with 
                the dilemma of updating the museum for last generation browsers 
                due to their size, some occupy 10Megabytes and many users neither 
                have them nor have the right kind of computers to use them. We 
                want MUVA to be accessible but at the same time, we do not want 
                it to become outdated. The webmaster is already studying the possibilities 
                for next year, in view of the dramatic changes to take place in 
                HTML and he is already developing a system that will make navigation 
                compatible to several browsers. 
              <li><b>Availability and visibility.</b> MUVA is motivated to achieve 
                more network visibility. However, it is difficult to get foreign 
                navigators interested in a country they usually know very little 
                about. We will continue to relate to art and educational centers 
                related to art and to Latin American studies and will investigate 
                new ways to make MUVA more accessible to a broad audience.

              It has become since 1996 a leader in Internet technology in Uruguay. 
              It has its own server, the only 10 MBPS server in Uruguay. With 
              the wide band, two servers, one in California and one in New York,

            <p><font size="-1">Setaro and Armand Ugon, had already sufficient 
              experience. They have been in charge of the digital version of the 
              newspaper El Pais, a leading site among the newspapers in the Spanish 
              speaking world. They created a sophisticated site TV Network, the 
              first TV Channel from Latin America to transmit all its programs 
              on-line. They created Interfutbol the first radio transmission via 
              Internet in the Spanish speaking world. They also created "Carlos 
              Gardel Canta en Internet" first server of Internet in the Spanish 
              speaking world in the area of real time videos on-line. They were 
              chosen by NASA in the Mars Pathfinder Expedition. They were the 
              only ones in Latin America to have the right to Mirror and transmit 
              it from Latin America and were chosen together with an Australian 
              company as the two servers to transmit it for the Southern Hemisphere 
              in a contest open to 20 servers. They were chosen because their 
              International Mirror Site has a load capacity of 2 millions hits 
              per day..<br>
