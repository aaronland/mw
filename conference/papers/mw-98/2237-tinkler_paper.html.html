          <h3>Online Exhibitions: A Philosophy of Design and Technological Implementation</h3>
          <h4><a href="../../bios/tinkler.html">Marc 
            Tinkler</a>, Plumb Design Inc.<br>
            Michael Freedman, Plumb Design Inc.</h4>
          Museums fill an important need in our society; they provide a physical 
          location where the public can gather to come into contact with objects 
          that have cultural, intellectual, or scientific value. Through visiting 
          a museum, viewers become part of a historic or artistic domain in a 
          manner that intensifies their understanding of the objects on display. 
          It would be fair to argue that one of the most essential features of 
          a museum exhibition is that visitors are within touching distance of 
          the objects on display. This very fact poses a fundamental contradiction 
          to anyone creating a virtual museum exhibition targeted for the digital 
          domain. How does one create a virtual exhibition that approaches the 
          power inherent in the proximity to unique objects imbedded with meaning? 
          The answer, as anyone who has worked in this capacity can attest to, 
          is that creating a virtual exhibition that approaches the strength of 
          even a middling real-life exhibition is extremely difficult. And yet 
          it is possible, through thoughtful curation and insightful design, to 
          create a meaningful exhibition that, while lacking the physicality of 
          a true museum, reflects the essential mission of a museum as a cultural 
          institution. 
          <p> The function of a virtual representation of a museum should mirror 
            that of a physical museum. It should be a tool for sharing a museum's 
            valuable assets with the rest of the world. By assets, I mean more 
            than merely the artifacts that a museum possesses. A true museum is 
            more than a building that houses a collection of objects, it is an 
            institution that establishes and fosters a community. One of a museum's 
            greatest assets is its ability to control what the audience sees, 
            to set an agenda, to establish dialog, to provoke thought and discussion. 
            An effective museum web site should do the same. It should be an extension 
            of the institution, not merely an online information desk that provides 
            helpful information. Of course, any web site should provide schedules, 
            programs, contacts, and other practical information, but an effective 
            web site can also serve the community in many other ways. 
          <p> First and most basically, a museum web site should act as resource 
            that supports the exhibitions currently on display in a museum. It 
            should generate interest, encourage people in the community to visit 
            the museum, and give them an idea of what they may see there. It should 
            act as a resource for people who have recently visited the museum 
            who want to acquire more knowledge about what they have just seen. 
            Second, a museum web site should be a research tool, a catalog of 
            the museum's holdings and an encyclopedia of information about and 
            related to the collection of the museum. It can point to outside references, 
            house research papers and allow the researcher to drill down into 
            all of the museum's accumulated knowledge. Third, it should act as 
            a community center. An effective web site can become a catalyst for 
            moderated debate and discussion by allowing its visitors to participate 
            in online forums, and by hosting guest lecturers that stimulate critical 
            discussion. A visit to a museum is not a solitary experience, nor 
            does a visit to the museum's site have to be. Fourth, and perhaps 
            most importantly, a museum's web site should become an extension of 
            the museum itself, and provide a virtual space for online exhibitions. 
            It can use the Internet as a medium in and of itself, providing thought 
            provoking exhibitions designed explicitly for the online experience. 
            These exhibitions should exploit the qualities of the digital medium, 
            and use them as opportunities to explore areas that would otherwise 
            be impossible in a physical museum environment. 
          <p> It is important to note that a web site hosted by a Museum is not 
            in and of itself, an online exhibition. Like any exhibition, to be 
            successful, an online exhibition should do more than put collections 
            online; it should reveal the underlying relationships that transform 
            a random collection of objects into a meaningful exhibition. It must 
            be curated to create an educational and thought-provoking experience. 
            This paper seeks to explore what makes an effective online exhibition. 
            It will look at some of the tools available to online curators, and 
            will examine the opportunities and challenges each of them present 
            from the perspective of creating a compelling experience. Finally, 
            the paper will examine a case study, and look at "Revealing Things", 
            a recent online exhibit hosted by the Smithsonian Institution, to 
            show the practical application of the ideas discussed. 
          <p> There are two fundamental ways in which an online exhibit differs 
            from a physical exhibit. Firstly, a computer will never be able to 
            replicate, or even closely simulate, the tactile experience a visitor 
            has in a museum when interfacing with an object. Secondly, visiting 
            a web site is a more solitary experience than visiting a museum. Visiting 
            even the most quiet, subdued museum is still a communal experience. 
            Viewing an online exhibition will always be a singular dialog between 
            the user and the computer. It is because of these differences that 
            I argue that an online exhibition should not just be a virtual representation 
            of a physical exhibit hall. An effective online exhibition exploits 
            the hyper-real qualities of digital media and uses them to create 
            a more compelling experience, rather than trying to mimic the structures 
            that have evolved for use in the physical world. An effective exhibition 
            views the limitations of the digital domain as opportunities rather 
            than constraints. 
          <p> Although there are many differences between physical and online 
            exhibitions, there is still a lot that can be learned from physical 
            exhibition design. Like a physical exhibit, an effective online exhibition 
            is a choreography of the viewer's experience. The designer of a digital 
            exhibit must think about rhythm and movement in many of the same ways 
            that a physical exhibit designer organizes the rhythm and placement 
            of objects within a museum. But an online exhibition can be alive 
            and can actively encourage exploration; it can respond differently 
            to different viewers. If a visitor does not interact with the material, 
            the exhibition may act autonomously to bring an array of images and 
            sounds to the viewer's attention. If the visitor explores actively, 
            the exhibition may take a more passive role. 
          <p> Like a physical exhibit, an effective exhibition does not rely on 
            one method to present information. An online exhibit should take advantage 
            of a variety of different technologies to provide a myriad of ways 
            for the user to interact with the material. Each section of an exhibition 
            can have its own pace, establishing a varied rhythm for the viewer 
            that helps to hold their interest. Some pieces of an exhibit should 
            be passive, allowing the user to explore an object or read related 
            information. Others parts should take an active role, and rely on 
            narrative to actively tell a story, or require the user to participate 
            in a focused way. 
          <p> Although variety is an important quality that contributes to effective 
            exhibit design, it is always possible to go overboard. It is important 
            to create an environment within an exhibition that is as seamless 
            as possible. Establishing an overall theme and creating a mood makes 
            it easier for the viewer to connect the information presented in different 
            of parts of the exhibit and to make inferences about the meaning of 
            the overall exhibition. If there is too much disparity between the 
            look and feel of the different areas of an exhibit, it is likely that 
            the viewer will get disoriented and will view the experience as a 
            collection of random objects and not a meaningful experience. A seamless 
            experience encourages exploration at a number of levels: visually, 
            aurally, intellectually, and emotionally. 
          <p> 
          <h3>Tools</h3>
          What is important is that the mood that you create for your exhibition 
          supports the overall idea that you are trying to communicate. Having 
          the right tools to make your exhibition is important, but no tool can 
          overcome the lack of a good idea, a strong overall organizational scheme, 
          and interesting subject material. There is only one constant in the 
          digital world, and that is that the innovative, cutting-edge technology 
          you are using today will be outdated tomorrow. The goal of an effective 
          exhibit is to create an experience whose meaning and impact is independent 
          of the technology used to implement it. Tools should be chosen that 
          are appropriate for the experience that you are trying to create. That 
          having been said, it is important to be familiar with as many tools 
          as possible, so that you can expand the arsenal that you have available 
          to you. A good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each 
          tool can help you evaluate which tool is appropriate for a given situation. 
          The more familiar you are with your tools, the more they will become 
          transparent to you and you audience. Here is a sampling of some of the 
          current tools available to online exhibit designers: 
          <p> <b>Old-fashioned HTML</b><br>
            HTML is still one of the easiest and most effective ways to communicate 
            information. Unfortunately, because of bandwidth constraints, it is 
            difficult to give the viewer of an online exhibition a tactile sense 
            of objects in a collection. This fact makes "tombstones" and related 
            information a much more integral part of any online exhibition. Stories, 
            anecdotes, and other interesting information about objects can help 
            to make an online exhibition interesting. But reading on a screen 
            is hard, so it is important to break pages up into smaller segments. 
            In general, scrollbars should be avoided, as they tend to break the 
            seamlessness of an experience. 
          <p> <b>JavaScript</b><br>
            For better or for worse, JavaScript is the glue that holds effective, 
            innovative online experiences together. JavaScript allows you to make 
            components on a page work together that would normally exist independently 
            of each other. It is far and away the most important tool in an exhibit 
            designer's arsenal, because it allows you to combine other tools in 
            ways that their designers could not have imagined. 
          <p> <b>Embedded Audio, MIDI & Beatnik</b><br>
            One advantage of the Web being a solitary experience is that you don't 
            have to give your visitors headphones in order to avoid annoying other 
            people. When used appropriately, audio can greatly enhance an online 
            exhibit. Background audio such as sample loops, MIDI, or Beatnik files 
            allows the designer to create a mood that can permeate an entire site. 
            Real Audio is perfect for narration, and WAV files are best for interaction 
            triggered sound. Not all sound has to be triggered by the user pressing 
            a "play" button. Sound could start and stop on its own accord, or 
            in response to a seemingly unrelated event. In general, try to integrate 
            the sound into the body of the exhibit. Avoid using the pre-packaged 
            "radio controls" that the browser or plug-in offers. These days, most 
            sound features can be accessed through JavaScript, which gives you 
            much greater control, and lets the user concentrate on the material, 
            not the technology. 
          <p> <b>QuickTime VR and PhotoVista</b><br>
            QuickTime VR and PhotoVista can perform two functions. First, they 
            allow the viewer to rotate an object around an axis, and view it in 
            three dimensions. Second, they can place the viewer in the center 
            of a virtual sphere, allowing the user to pan in any direction, creating 
            an interesting pseudo-virtual-reality experience. These tools are 
            good for allowing the user to explore a small artifact like a piece 
            of jewelry, or experience an immense space like the inside of the 
            Pantheon. They are both fairly bandwidth intensive and should be used 
            sparingly. Both formats allow the designer to place hotspots that 
            either link to other pages, or transport you to a different view. 
            One interesting idea is to use JavaScript to make the hotspots trigger 
            external events, or to use external events such as audio narration 
            to trigger a QuickTime VR or PhotoVista display to rotate to a particular 
            position. 
          <p> <b>Internet Imaging Protocol</b><br>
            Internet Imaging Protocol (IIP) is not getting a lot of press, but 
            it holds a lot of promise for the Museum community. It allows the 
            user to download a high-resolution image in small pieces rather than 
            all at once. This means that a user can get an overall view of an 
            artifact and then zoom to near-infinite resolution, downloading only 
            the information that they need. This technology, when used appropriately, 
            could, for instance, allow visitors to zoom into a Van Gogh painting 
            on the Web and study the exquisite detail of his brushwork. Unfortunately, 
            IIP is not quite ready for primetime. A plug-in is required, generally 
            the interfaces are quite clunky, and there are no API's that allow 
            you to manipulate the images through JavaScript. If combined with 
            QuickTime VR or FlashPix, IIP could turn out to be quite promising. 
          <p> <b>Dynamic HTML</b><br>
            Dynamic HTML fully realizes the potential that JavaScript and HTML 
            introduced. It allows the designer to manipulate all aspects of an 
            HTML document in real time. The possibilities that Dynamic HTML has 
            introduced are limitless. The designer can create layers that appear, 
            move, and disappear based on user interaction or precise timing. Because 
            the pages are still HTML, they can be created "on the fly" using a 
            database or a server-side script. This means that the experience can 
            be dynamically altered for each individual user. An item in the exhibition 
            may not only look differently, for example, if a user has seen this 
            item before, but it can behave differently. 
          <p> <b>Shockwave Flash</b><br>
            Shockwave Flash is unique in that it allows the designer to create 
            low-bandwidth, "high energy" pieces that download very fast, but have 
            an almost theatrical quality. Flash is great for narrative pieces, 
            because it allows you to create very long sequences that can be fast 
            to download while having an enormous experiential value. You can integrate 
            streaming audio with Flash and, using JavaScript, you can make flash 
            trigger any event that may happen elsewhere on the page. 
          <p> <b>Shockwave for Director</b><br>
            In the same family as Flash, is Shockwave for Director, which is best 
            at creating stand-alone games, puzzles and other educational pieces. 
            Shockwave files are larger than Flash files, but you can do almost 
            anything you can imagine using Director. One downside to Shockwave 
            and Flash is that they are static files. Changing the behavior or 
            content within a piece is difficult, and requires "re-building" them. 
            Pieces that are dynamically generated or altered by multiple users 
            are possible to create, but other technologies like Java may be more 
            appropriate for complex network oriented tasks. 
          <p> <b>Java</b><br>
            If you can dream it, you can do it in Java. On the positive side, 
            since Java is a full-fledged programming language, theoretically, 
            anything is possible. Most browsers support it, so your users don't 
            have to download any plug-ins. On the negative side, since Java is 
            a full-fledged programming language, in order to develop anything 
            custom-made, you need to have access to experienced programmers to 
            really make it worthwhile. Java also suffers from being a relatively 
            young technology. It is not always consistent, reliable, or as cross-platform 
            as advertised, but if you are willing to spend the time, Java can 
            really pay off. 
          <p> This is just a small sampling of the technologies that are available 
            to the on-line exhibit designer today. There are countless other tools 
            out there, and new technologies are coming to market every day. What 
            is important to remember, is that every tool, no matter how new and 
            cutting-edge, should enrich the viewer's experience. Again, the goal 
            of an effective exhibit is to create an experience whose meaning and 
            impact is independent of the technology used to implement it.

          <h3>Case Study: Revealing Things</h3>
          The Smithsonian Institution wanted to develop an online exhibition devoted 
          to material culture that combined objects from the Smithsonian collection 
          with everyday objects contributed by visitors. The prototype solution, 
          which I had the privilege of working on, is entitled "Revealing Things", 
          and it will launch in early March 1998. It is instructive to examine 
          both the challenges presented and the solutions offered by the Smithsonian 
          team, because they are on the cutting edge of on-line exhibition design. 
          <p> The goal of the exhibition was to convey to the visitor that everyday 
            objects are more than the sum of their function and use; everyday 
            objects are important signifiers of cultural and personal meaning. 
            Ideally, after experiencing "Revealing Things", visitors will begin 
            to interpret the messages and meanings that everyday objects communicate, 
            and ultimately will gain an increased awareness of the objects that 
            surround them. 
          <p> Saussure said that a sign was two-parted: the signifier and the 
            signified. The signifier and the signified have an arbitrary, culturally 
            specific relationship. A non-arbitrary relationship between the signifier 
            and the signified is symbolic. Objects are signs or signifiers of 
            meaning when viewed in contrast to other objects. He said, "Nothing 
            has meaning in itself and relationships are all important." 
          <p> If we accept Saussure's hypothesis, a full understanding of any 
            artifact can only be accomplished by absorbing and comprehending the 
            culture in which that object was made and used. Thus, meaning is attached 
            to an artifact by understanding it as a node in a larger context. 
          <p> In a physical exhibit, the curator would have to deconstruct the 
            meaning of every object in order to classify it and determine its 
            position in the exhibition. In a physical exhibit, for example, a 
            pair of jeans worn to a rock-and-roll concert either can be placed 
            with other articles of clothing, or with other objects associated 
            with the music of the time. Our goal was to take advantage of the 
            possibilities of the digital medium in order to present the multi-dimensional 
            nature of the relationships between objects, history, and personal 
            meaning. Our solution was not a deconstruction in response to the 
            complexity of the information, but rather a reconstruction of the 
            complex network of meaning that surrounds every object in the collection. 
          <p> The exhibit uses a Java-based technology called Thinkmap to create 
            a dynamic interface that demonstrates the underlying connections among 
            the objects. Thinkmap animates data, displaying the underlying connections 
            between discrete items. The relationships between items in a Thinkmap 
            database are not absolute and over-determined, but dynamic and subjectively 
            conditioned by the viewer. Information-publishers who use Thinkmap 
            can create a series of flexible rules that define object behavior. 
            These rules ultimately determine the display's look-and-feel. The 
            Thinkmap interface we created enables visitors to choose their path 
            through the exhibition. A visitor examining a lantern made by a Japanese-American 
            in the Manzanar Relocation Center during World War II, for example, 
            could pick a number of different methods to view other objects. She 
            could study objects from the same period (the table setting from a 
            dinner given during Pearl Harbor), "decorative objects" (a tiffany 
            vase), or objects whose stories have similar themes (a cookie mold 
            made by Arab-American immigrants). This flexibility allows visitors 
            to follow their interests and enables curators to display objects 
            in a variety of contexts. In a museum, objects can be in only one 
            place at one time. In Revealing Things, objects are dynamically positioned 
            depending on the preference of the user. The curator becomes a guide, 
            building the underlying structure. The visitor designs the exhibition. 
            Just as a person can walk through a museum, choosing objects that 
            interest her, a user of Revealing Things can pick a few objects and 
            delve deeper into those that she finds particularly attractive. 
          <p> Each object in the collection is presented in a different way. Most 
            objects are presented using a single page of HTML that starts off 
            with a story or anecdote. Audio is used to reenforce important parts 
            of the narrative and helps to draw users into the second-level pages 
            that delve deeper into the object's meaning. Other objects are presented 
            using Flash movies that tell a story or provide historical background. 
            In the final exhibition, there will be QuickTime VR or PhotoVista 
            views of artifacts, as well as Shockwave games and puzzles to encourage 
            user interaction. The ultimate goal is to present a variety of experiences, 
            to establish a rhythm of passive and active periods for the viewer. 
          <p> The result not only serves to link disparate objects in novel ways, 
            but also entices people into the exhibit to explore. The interface, 
            written in Java, is always moving, and encourages people to click 
            and explore. What could have been a static exhibition becomes an expandable, 
            lively, interactive, learning platform, where visitors are engaged 
            in seeing and contributing to their own learning experience. 
          <p> 
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          A Museum's online presence should reflect the role the Museum plays 
          in the community. Part of that role is providing thought-provoking experiences 
          for the visitor, whether they are physical or virtual. No matter how 
          advanced on-line technology becomes, creating a virtual exhibition that 
          approaches the intimacy of a real-life exhibition will always be extremely 
          difficult. Successful online exhibitions require thoughtful curation, 
          insightful design, and a healthy knowledge of the tools and technologies 
          available. But, even though many digital technologies are in their infancy, 
          it is possible to create a meaningful exhibition that, while lacking 
          the physicality of a true museum, reflects the essential mission of 
          a museum as a cultural institution. A good exhibition, physical or virtual, 
          provides a place where viewers become part of a historic or artistic 
          domain in a manner that intensifies their understanding of the objects 
          on display. All successful online exhibitions exploit the qualities 
          of the digital medium, and use them as opportunities to explore areas 
          that would otherwise be impossible in a physical museum environment.
