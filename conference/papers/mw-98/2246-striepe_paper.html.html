                "Ladies and gentlemen. My name is Karl Friedrich Schinkel. I am 
                probably not known here in the French colonies, therefore I would 
                like to introduce myself.<br>
                I was born on the 13 March 1781 in the town of Neuruppin, about 
                50 miles northwest of Berlin, and have been working as an architect 
                in Prussia for a quite long time now and with remarkable and ongoing 
                success. The city of Berlin as it still is in your time bears 
                witness to this. Your colleagues from the time travel project 
                generously invited me to this conference in order to demonstrate 
                a VR system I developed with my student Carl Gropius - a name 
                that most likely doesn't mean anything to you either. Well, in 
                my time VR systems are a really big thing, in particular during 
                Christmas business.<a name="we"> We</a> call these systems 'mechanical 
                exhibitions', in academic circles they are called a little bombastically 
                'dioramas'<sup><a href="#fussnote">1</a></sup> . In the beginning 
                our VR system mainly consisted of a large circular panorama painting 
                constructing a closed room system which the user could enter and 
                where he could see foreign places, pre-historic scenes, historical 
                events, etc. The VR concept with the name "fast-time" the colleagues 
                from Berlin presented to me seems to be heading in the same direction. 
                In a second step we added animation features to the system, and 
                turned our pseudo-3-D system into a real 3-D system. We put the 
                panoramas on tracks and extended the system by additional foreground 
                paintings, which were also on tracks. Kinematics specialists developed 
                a mechanism that moved the paintings against one another in a 
                way that the user had e.g. the illusion of strolling around in 
                a real town. And this without any head-mounted display or any 
                other head-tracking device. We finally made the breakthrough by 
                integrating various multimedia modules: Educated speakers supplying 
                the user with background information, an orchestra that generated 
                appropriate acoustics and a complex lighting design for the foreground 
                and background images gave the system the necessary atmospheric 
                quality for the first time. In particular we are proud on our 
                "fog"-feature. With this feature we can wonderfully model the 
                morning fog in a landscape panorama or the smoke in a battle panorama. 
                Dr. Braun, is there any comparable feature in your VR system? 
                Please have a look at the VR model of our VR system, which was 
                kindly generated by the colleagues from the time traveling project. 
                I think it is about time to pass over to Dr. Braun. Thank you 
                very much for letting me present my system without an appointment. 
                I wish you a successful conference and good bye."

                "Dear Mr. Schinkel, thank you very much for your introduction. 
                I wish you a pleasant journey back to the 19th century." As you 
                have seen time travels are a nice thing, even though, or exactly 
                because they show quite clearly that virtual worlds are not only 
                an achievement of the information society on the edge to the 3rd 
                millennium, as the recent media VR hype wants to make us believe. 
                Mankind has always constructed virtual worlds. Among the creators 
                were artists, musicians, and painters, not to mention numberless 
                storytellers. In our paper we would like to talk mainly about 
                the experiences in dramaturgy and design we had during the development 
                of an online VR landscape. This online VR landscape which is still 
                under construction is supposed to serve as an exhibition platform 
                for museums, archives and libraries. The VR scene is an as realistic 
                as possible reconstruction of Friedrichswerder, a central quarter 
                of the city of Berlin. We have chosen Friedrichswerder because 
                it was once an important center for fashion and media in Europe. 
                Besides, many famous buildings of Karl Friedrich Schinkel are 
                to be found in this area. <a name="and">And </a>last not least 
                it was an urban area for which complete architectural data were 
                available from one of our project partners: the Bauakademie<sup><a href="#fussnote2">2</a></sup> 
                . Friedrichswerder had been reconstructed for three years: 1850, 
                1928 and 1993 (Figure 1). Since the building development normally 
                changes gradually, we could follow the architectural development 
                of this quarter from 1830 until today almost continuously. Only 
                the massive devastation in World War II interrupts this continuity.

                to this time-traveling function we consider our VR platform more 
                a 4-D world rather than a 3-D world. Depending on the chosen time 
                the user then moves in a scenery consisting of objects that are 
                specific to this time. Only time specific buildings are presented 
                to the user, and the street environment, public transportation 
                and other vehicles, every day objects, window displays and advertisement 
                posters, people that are dressed in the fashion of the time, etc. 
                These scene objects can be moving objects, e.g. a car, or can 
                be animated by audio and video sequences as for example a radio 
                or a TV set. The user can get additional information, whether 
                it is on a certain object of the scene or on a more general historical 
                context, in separate multimedia browsers which are activated via 
                so-called feature objects in the VR scene (Figures 2-3). Additional 
                information can be made available in all different types of digital 
                media: text, image, 3-D object, sound and film. Access to an online-database 
                can be offered in these browsers by integrated hyperlinks.

                different content simultaneously. For the prototype system we 
                focus on three subjects which are supposed to be time traveling 
                examples: the architectural history of the city of Berlin, the 
                historical changes of mass media and the history of consumer products. 
                Allow us two words on the technical side of the project: the VR 
                scenery is developed in VRML and Java, PostgreSQL is used to realize 
                the access to underlying databases.

              <td><b><a name="luggage">3. Luggage and lodging: Which objects match 
                the time?</a></b><br>
                <p>In this section, we would like to address several design issues 
                  which we have not yet solved to our full satisfaction.</p>
                <p>The convincing power of a VR landscape, in particular when 
                  it is about a historical scene, depends a lot on its atmospheric 
                  qualities. The atmospheric appearance of a VR scene is determined 
                  by the visual aesthetics, including the degree of dirtiness 
                  of the generated objects, as well as by the often neglected 
                  space acoustics. Computer-generated architectural models are 
                  simply too clean - they are only convincing when the story is 
                  about new buildings. Otherwise street dirt is missing and the 
                  whole range of real life traces of decline caused by time and 
                  environment. With current software unfortunately these effects 
                  can only be realized with an extremely high effort. In our project 
                  the absence of such effects is particularly visible, because 
                  for a lot of set constructions we use photographs. The consequence 
                  is that new, proper objects are next to visibly old and dirty 
                  objects even though they come from the same time period.</p>
                <p>The problem of aesthetics mainly concerns scenes of those times 
                  before the invention of photography. Imagine that our time machine 
                  would really allow us to take brilliant and sharp color shots 
                  in the 19th century, and import them into the present. The photographs 
                  would certainly not convince us because our collective vision 
                  of the 19th century is influenced by paintings. There bright 
                  colors and hard contrasts had no place. Therefore for the scenery 
                  we try to adapt the visual aesthetics of the 19th century city 
                  and landscape painting.</p>
                <p>When the problems of appearance quality are solved a time variable 
                  VR platform can supply a range of new and interesting options 
                  for exhibitions with historical objects and the mediation of 
                  historical knowledge. The biggest advantage of VR landscapes 
                  is certainly that they can visually supply a historical context 
                  for museum objects. In classical exhibitions the context is 
                  usually reduced to the literal frame in which the object is 
                  presented. The historical context is then available as an explanation 
                  text and therefore purely mentally accesible. At best visualizations 
                  of the object are supplied in catalogues and can be studied 
                  after the museum visit at home.</p>
                <p>As opposed to the procedure described above a VR landscape 
                  allows us to connect a single historical object with the appropriate 
                  urban context and its real life component. In exhibitions with 
                  objects related to a historical change this is of particular 
                  advantage. The historical context is, so to speak, automatically 
                  delivered by the time traveling function as long as the development 
                  takes place in the time span covered by the system.</p>
                <p>The contextual relation of museum objects supports multiple 
                  synergies when the VR platform is used for several exhibitions 
                  with diverse issues. This can be accompanied by very practical 
                  advantages e.g. when objects of the exhibition with subject 
                  A can be used as set for the exhibition with subject B, and 
                  vice versa. Therefore we are hoping that the tremendous work 
                  effort we have had to put in the set objects of our VR world, 
                  could be reduced if a future VR platform was intensely used 
                  by museums. In addition, an interesting synergy in content can 
                  also be the result. A user who is for instance interested in 
                  an exhibition focus "History of consumer products" which is 
                  planned by us, will be seduced to also look at information concerning 
                  "History of mass media". In this case the connecting element 
                  would be the change in product advertisement.</p>
                <p>The strong context relation of exhibition objects also has 
                  its problematic side. Obviously a connection to a specific every 
                  day context demands correct dating and spatial categorization 
                  of the object. Since most museum objects are usually presented 
                  in isolation, exact information on their life time and distribution 
                  areas is not needed. Therefore we had to undertake substantial 
                  research to get this missing information for the set objects 
                  of our VR landscape.</p>
                <p>Another problem pointed out by historians is the historical 
                  distortion for which such a VR platform could be blamed. On 
                  a pure visual level the differentiation between the museums 
                  object and the illustrative set fades for the user. But that 
                  is exactly the point. These boundaries are explicitly supposed 
                  to vanish: the fading of boundaries is the suggestive power 
                  of the VR platform. The illustrative objects are designed in 
                  order to recreate history as a whole not only a fragmented piece. 
                  It only has to be made clear what they could have looked like 
                  that in the chosen time and in the reconstructed urban area 
                  in which they could have existed. In contrast, museum objects 
                  are defined rigidly. In fact, we could have avoided these accusations 
                  by countering that no historian was able to help us when we 
                  needed "hard" facts.</p>
                <p>Finally, we acknowledge a problem concerning user guidance. 
                  Users of the system must be able to receive information on the 
                  historical status of an object via adequate navigation systems. 
                  The problems of historical framing also demonstrated that an 
                  exhibition realized on an online VR platform made greater demands 
                  on an interdisciplinary approach than any conventional show. 
                  Such an enterprise is unthinkable without a functioning cooperation 
                  between archivists, librarians, photographers, historians of 
                  diverse special knowledge and a strong willingness to communicate 
                  with the involved VR specialists.</p>

                Navigation within online 4-D worlds</a></b><br>
                <p>As in real life, in virtual reality the question to whom the 
                  travel offer should be made, must be addressed. In both situations 
                  two opposite types can be found: on the one side the kind of 
                  traveler who wants to know before hand what will be expected 
                  and who wants to be pampered and permanently informed. On the 
                  other side we have the knap sack freak on his search for adventure 
                  and authenticity. This candidate would feel uncomfortanle with 
                  organized travel and be worried about his freedom.</p>
                <p>As in real life both traveling groups could interfere in a 
                  negative way. Just think for instance of visual or acoustic 
                  hints integrated in the scene which could possibly destroy the 
                  knap sack freak's illusion or think of the misuse of the VR 
                  platform as a 3-D adventure game which brings the server to 
                  a standstill and therefore disturbs a serious traveler on his 
                  educational journey. But unlike the real world, the VR-technology 
                  has more options available in order to allow both groups to 
                  go their own way without interfering. The travelers can switch 
                  between free exploration and guided tour at any time. This was 
                  the main reason for our decision to offer both possibilities.</p>
                <p>The guided tour is addressed to users who have no experience 
                  with the navigation in 3D worlds. It is also addressed to users 
                  looking for very specific museum information. We are planning 
                  to establish guided tours for all three main subjects. With 
                  the help of a separate browser window the guided tour will lead 
                  the visitor step by step to the historically interesting sites. 
                  With every stop additional information to the subject will be 
                  supplied (Figure 4). The visitor can decide when the next step 
                  will be made. Any time he can switch to the free navigation. 
                  For museums which want to use the VR platform for an online 
                  exhibition the guided tour is an important design element.</p>

                <p>Much more difficult to design is the navigation assistance 
                  for users who want to move freely. In fact, there are two problems 
                  to be solved which are not directly related to each other. First, 
                  the user has to be provided with feedback on where he is moving, 
                  virtually, and what time he currently is in. Otherwise he will 
                  be a victim of the 'lost in space' phenomenon, which here also 
                  means a 'lost in time' syndrome as well. In order to prevent 
                  this we planned some kind of pilot display which is inserted 
                  as a standard object in a separate browser window. In this window 
                  the actual time is indicated, and can be changed by turning 
                  on a time wheel. Furthermore, this window includes a city map. 
                  On the map the actual location of the visitor as well as all 
                  the stops of the guided tour are indicated. With a mouse click 
                  on the map the visitor can move to another site. With a click 
                  on the guided tour stop he leaves the free navigation mode and 
                  latches onto a guided tour.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the user needs assistance in order to locate those 
                  objects behind which additional information might be hidden. 
                  Therefore in the map of the pilot display all feature objects 
                  will be indicated as hot spots. In the scene itself only the 
                  special arrangement of objects will point out on feature objects. 
                  Otherwise the interest in free exploration would be lost. Whenever 
                  the set contains very detailed or moving objects, or the lighting 
                  and acoustics noticeably differ from the surroundings, the visitor 
                  can expect additional information.</p>

                <p>Let us undertake another time travel and let us look back on 
                  the near future of our VR platform and other similar VR worlds. 
                  Considering the speed of technological development, five years 
                  from now should be enough. Well, looking at the year 2003, the 
                  view is rather foggy. Still, three developments seem to be quite 
                  clear. One development concerning the users of VR landscapes, 
                  one concerning the museums and one concerning the data both 
                  users and museums are dealing with.</p>
                <p>We'll find far more activity in development of VR worlds. Museum 
                  educators and teachers obviously overcame their mental reservation 
                  against DOOM and other computer games, and encouraged the development 
                  of multi-user VR worlds populated with avatars.</p>
                <p>The old-style museum belongs to the past. Classical museum 
                  functions are no longer under the control of a single curator. 
                  Many museums have specialized in purchase, filing and conservation 
                  of objects.</p>
                <p>The copyrights on images including the copyrights on 3-D presentation 
                  are mostly hold by big media and telecommunication companies. 
                  Some museums turned into data brokers or exhibition agencies. 
                  They react to sensational media events like "The sinking of 
                  the Titanic" and organize exhibitions of current interest. This 
                  is a development which we actually took for granted when we 
                  started to develop our online VR systems.</p>
                <p>PICS is as dead as Z3950 - even Dublin-Core and Iconclass are 
                  seriously ill. The winner is Extra-Medium-Large. We could have 
                  used such a meta data solution on the basis of XML, even for 
                  our small project. But one look at the confusion in standards 
                  discussed by the museums, archives and libraries convinced us 
                  to desist from using meta data.</p>
                <p>Final result: We can look back optimistically on our future.</p>
