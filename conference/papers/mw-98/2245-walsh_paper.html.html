            <h3>The Web and the Horse in the Cave: New Technologies and the Meaning 
              of Art</h3>
            <h4><a href="../../bios/walsh.html">Peter 
              Walsh</a>, Davis Museum and Cultural Center, Wellesley College</h4>
            My late father was a clergyman and preacher of some skill. Perhaps 
            because I follow his example, I like to begin my talks with a reading, 
            which I then follow with a lesson. 
            <p> The reading for this talk comes from the classic book, Primitive 
              Art, by the pioneering anthropologist, Franz Boas: 
            <p> 
            <blockquote>"The process of reading in is not at all unfamiliar to 
              us," Boas writes when discussing the origins of symbolism. "We see 
              realistic forms in the shapes of mountains and clouds and in marks 
              on rocks, and we enjoy the play of fancy that endows natural forms 
              with new meanings... Koch-Grünberg... tells us that the [South American] 
              Indians, when camping at a portage... , take up accidental marks 
              on the rocks and by pecking develop them into forms suggested by 
              the natural outlines, or that they take up the lines left by a preceding 
              party who amused themselves in the same way... We have also ample 
              evidence to show that curiously formed rocks are not only compared 
              with animate beings, but that they are actually considered as men 
              or beasts transformed into stone. Thus the Pueblo Indians tell in 
              their migration legend that a person or an animal became tired on 
              account of the fatigue of the long travel, sat down and was transformed 
              into stone."</blockquote>
            [<a href="#foot1" name="foot1back">1</a>] 
            <p> Let's look at the first images: 
            <p> [LEFT: Spotted Horse Frieze; RIGHT: Pech-Merle Gallery] 
            <p> On the left is the "Horse in the Cave" from which this talk takes 
              its title. This is the "Spotted Horse Frieze" from the Paleolithic 
              cave complex of Pech Merle, in the Lot Valley of Western France, 
              a work probably made somewhere between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago[<a href="#foot2" name="foot2back">2</a>]. 
              It is one of the most famous works from the rather long period of 
              time now considered the dawn of art. The hand silhouettes you see 
              besides the painting are also common in Ice Age art and were probably 
              made, like the horse itself, by spraying or spitting paint onto 
              the rock face. They have been interpreted as pre-literate versions 
              of signatures.

          <td width="450"> 
            <p> This image does not really do the original justice, I'm afraid. 
              For one thing, it omits the setting[<a href="#foot3" name="foot3back">3</a>], 
              which was clearly important to the artist of this work[<a href="#foot4" name="foot4back">4</a>]. 
              The Pech Merle complex is a stalactite cave and, long before the 
              painting was made, was filled with spectacular limestone formations, 
              as in the image from Pech Merle on the right. The Spotted Horse 
              is at the center of a enormous cave chamber, surrounded by hanging 
              stalactites, stalagmites, columns, and other formations that make 
              the chamber look like the nave of a fantastic cathedral. 
            <p> At the far left of the Spotted Horse you can make out the head 
              of the horse, which is, in fact, a natural rock formation that the 
              artist recognized and incorporated into his work. The archaeologist 
              Paul Bahn has pointed out that incorporating natural forms into 
              art works is common in Ice Age cave art, as it seems to have been 
              common among the Native Americans Boas describes. [<a href="#foot5" name="foot5back">5</a>] 
            <p> Here, and in other cases, I would suggest that the result reflects 
              a particular kind of magic[<a href="#foot6" name="foot6back">6</a>], 
              one which must have been extraordinarily important to the artist. 
            <p> The magic, I would say, is something very real and something we 
              can still appreciate thousands of years later. The magic begins 
              with a combination of perception, which sees the illusion of the 
              horse's head in the rock, and human consciousness, which simultaneously 
              recognizes that the illusion exists yet the rock is somehow not 
              an actual, living horse. Finally, human skill completes the spell, 
              because the artist is able to elaborate on this awareness of illusion 
              and reality by covering the rock with a painting memorializing it. 
            <p> In other words, the magic of the Horse in the Cave is nothing 
              less than the ability to put meaning into inanimate objects through 
              art. What precisely the Spotted Horse meant to its creators can 
              no longer be reconstructed, but that the meaning was there, and 
              was powerful, seems hard to deny. This translation of meaning into 
              stone and paint is so powerful that it is even now hard to comprehend 
              or explain away. So it is not so difficult to see how the Pueblo 
              Indians, among others, imagined that the stones they found full 
              of meaning were once living beings magically transformed. 
            <p> "Magic" has become a degraded word in contemporary culture, a 
              synonym for superstition or trickery. (The English word magic comes 
              from a Greek word, based in turn on the Persian magus, which meant 
              "someone versed in the secrets of nature.") Yet one of the main 
              points of this paper is that the magic of the image is still very 
              much with us, despite our attempts to rationalize it away. 
            <p> "And magic?" Boas argues in Primitive Art: 
            <p> 
            <blockquote>"I believe if a boy should observe someone spitting on 
              his photograph and cutting it to pieces he would feel duly outraged. 
              I know if this should have happened to me when I was a student... 
              I should have done my level best do to my adversary in natura what 
              he had done to me in effigie and I should have considered my success 
              as a compensation for the harm done me... I do not believe that 
              my feelings would have differed much from those of other young men." 
            </blockquote>
            [<a href="#foot7" name="foot7back">7</a>] 
            <p> Other writers, most notably David Freedberg in his book, The Power 
              of Images, have made similar observations. 
            <p> 
            <blockquote>"We may be quite happy to believe that images in primitive 
              cultures are felt to partake of the life of what they represent," 
              Freedberg writes. "But we do not like to think this of ourselves, 
              or of our own society." </blockquote>
            [<a href="#foot8" name="foot8back">8</a>]
            <p> In fact, what the Horse in the Cave teaches us is that image-making 
              is an essential part of being human, demonstrates, as the British 
              anthropologist Desmond Morris has but it, "...that the aesthetic 
              urge in Homo sapiens is not some recent refinement of civilization, 
              but part of an ancient, deep-seated need of our species. The study 
              of prehistoric art not only informs us about our Stone Age past 
              and the way we lived then, it also tells us about what kind of species 
              we are not and have always been. [<a href="#foot9" name="foot9back">9</a>] 
            <p> Let me jump ahead now several thousand years to the fourth century 
              B.C. 
            <p> [LEFT: Roman copy of the Aphrodite of Cnidus] 
            <p> This is a damaged, much reduced Roman version of what was once 
              the most famous work of art in the world. The artist was Praxiteles, 
              one of the great sculptors of the Golden Age of Athens. Praxiteles 
              created, according to legend, two sculptures, one draped and one 
              nude of the goddess of love and beauty, Aphrodite, and offered them 
              to the city of Cos. Cos chose the draped figure; the nude version 
              was snapped up by the neighboring city of Cnidus, to the ever lasting 
              chagrin of Cos. 
            <p> By Praxiteles' day, civilization had invented writing, travel, 
              tourism, and, as a combination of the three, fame. Pliny described 
              the Aphrodite of Cnidus as "the finest statue not only by Praxiteles 
              but in the entire world.[<a href="#foot10" name="foot10back">10</a>]" 
              The Cnidians set it in shrine open on every side and the statue 
              became so famous that, two centuries later, King Nicomedes of Bithynia 
              tried to buy the statue by paying off the enormous Cnidian national 
              debt. The Cnidians refused, preferring misery to losing the one 
              thing that had put them on the map. In another famous story of the 
              image, the statue so aroused one young man that saw it that he visited 
              the sculpture by night and assaulted it sexually [<a href="#foot11" name="foot11back">11</a>] 
            <p> By this time the fame of images has added to their magic, added 
              to them in such a way that the original work has a special power 
              that copies only enhance. By the first century B.C. in the closing 
              years of the Roman Republic, when Rome already ruled most of the 
              classical world, Greek originals had become intensely valued and 
              an essential part of both the identity of their cities and of the 
              tourist trade. The conquering Romans, in fact, had to be legally 
              constrained from carrying these treasures off with them. The citizens 
              of Sicily even engaged the celebrated Cicero to prosecute their 
              Roman governor, Verres, for pillaging both their private collections 
              and their public buildings and even their temples of celebrated 
              art works. Cicero raged against Verres in his court statements, 
              listing the art treasures of the civilized world underlining how 
              important such original art works had become. 
            <p> 
            <blockquote>"What do you think that the Rhegians, who now are Roman 
              citizens, would take to allow that marble Venus to be taken from 
              them? What would the Tarentines take to lose the Europa sitting 
              on the Bull? or the Satyr which they have in the temple of Vesta? 
              or their other monuments? What would the Thespians take to lose 
              the statue of Cupid, the only object for which anyone ever goes 
              to see Thespiae? What would the men of Cnidos take for their marble 
              Venus? or the Coans for their picture of her? or the Ephesians for 
              Alexander? the men of Cyzicus for their Ajax or Medea? What would 
              the Rhodians take for Ialysus? the Athenians for their marble Bacchus, 
              or their picture of Paralus, or their brazen Heifer, the work of 
              Myron? It would be a long business and an unnecessary one, to mention 
              what is worth going to see among all the different nations in all 
              Asia and Greece; but that is the reason why I am enumerating these 
              things, because I wish you to consider that an incredible indignation 
              must be the feeling of those men from whose cities these things 
              are carried away."</blockquote>
            [<a href="#foot12" name="foot12back">12</a>] 
            <p> This intensity of feeling for original art works continued long 
              after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century 
              AD. Throughout the Middle Ages, the veneration of religious images, 
              such as the Madonna of Rocamadour, was as intense as the veneration 
              of saintly relics, and, like the relics, inspired pilgrimages to 
              behold them and perhaps be touched by their miraculous powers. [<a href="#foot13" name="foot13back">13</a>] 
            <p> We move ahead now several centuries to the nineteenth century, 
              in which a sudden outburst of inventions created new ways to reproduce 
              art works. For our purposes, the most important of these was the 
              chromolithograph, which made it possible to photographically reproduce 
              works of art and mass produce thousands cheap copies. Commercial 
              chromolithographic art reproductions became a lucrative business 
              in Europe, and these cheap chromolithographs quickly spread to the 
              humblest of homes, even to people who would never have been able 
              to afford art of any kind before. 
            <p> One artist who became especially well known through chromolithographic 
              reproductions of his work was Jean François Millet, who painted 
              these two works in the late 1850s: 
            <p> [LEFT: Millet, The Angelus,; RIGHT: Millet, The Gleaners] 
            <p> On the left is The Angelus of 1859, and on the right is The Gleanders 
              of 1857; both are now in the Louvre. In fact, I remember framed, 
              sepia-toned lithographic versions of these paintings hanging in 
              the back of my six-grade classroom. 
            <p> The enormous celebrity the wide distribution of chromolithographic 
              reproductions created for certain paintings like these of Millet 
              did not lessen popular interest in the originals. On the contrary, 
              they increased the interest, although mass popularity had unexpected 
              side effects, as the Impressionist Camille Pissarro pointed out 
              in a 1887 letter to his son, Lucien: 
            <p> 
            <blockquote>"I went to the Millet exhibition yesterday with Amelia... 
              A dense crowd---There I ran into Hyancinthe Pozier, he greeted me 
              with the announcement that he had just received a great shock, he 
              was all in tears, we thought someone in his family had died---Not 
              at all, it was The Angelus, Millet's painting which had provoked 
              his emotion. The canvas, one of the painter's poorest, a canvas 
              for which in these times 500,000 francs were refused, has just this 
              moral effect on the vulgarians who crowd around it: they trample 
              one another before it! This is literally true-and makes one take 
              a sad view of humanity... These people see only the trivial side 
              of art...What animals! It is heart-breaking!" </blockquote>
            [<a href="#foot14" name="foot14back">14</a>] 
            <p> Pissarro is distressed by the strange effect that fame tends to 
              have on an original work of art: they make into a quasi-religious 
              object, almost a fetish. The qualities that Pissarro values in a 
              work-- taste, innovation, color, composition, moral qualities-have 
              been completely overwhelmed by the reproduction-induced fame of 
              the work. 
            <p> Hereafter, reproductions of art do not so much stand in or replace 
              the originals, they become a kind of symbol pointing to the original. 
              Thus, in Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisted, the narrator, Charles 
              Ryder, hangs a reproduction of Van Gogh's Sunflowers in his Oxford 
              rooms as a sign of his advanced but somewhat geeky taste as a freshman 
              undergraduate. In the recent Oscar-winning movie Titanic, versions 
              of Millet and Picasso paintings, standing in for the originals, 
              are symbols of the independent spirit and cultural superiority of 
              the heroine who owns them (unfortunately they go down with the ship). 
            <p> Via these reproductions, universally available, the "magic" of 
              the Horse in the Cave has been translated into the status, prestige, 
              individualism, and the nonverbal communication of these to mass 
              audiences. But does this vulgarization really trivialize or neutralize 
              powers of the original? I think not. 
            <p> [LEFT: Gallery View of the Louvre] 
            <p> This is a photograph I took some years ago of a gallery at the 
              Louvre in Paris. The box-like object that is attracting the attention 
              of the crowd is a special case containing Leonardo's Mona Lisa-- 
              the Aphrodite of Cnidos of our own times. Ironically the case, with 
              its heavy protective glass and its intermittent lights, make the 
              painting almost invisible: something like a postcard stuck inside 
              a toaster oven. Still, everyone in the room is fixed on this one 
              object and is ignoring the much more visible and perhaps more important 
              paintings on the left, which include Leonardo's Madonna of the Rocks 
            <p> The point I am trying to make here is that the endless reproductions 
              made of the Mona Lisa and other famous pictures have not dulled 
              or lessened interest in the originals, as you might at first expect. 
              Instead, they have intensified the inherent magic of the object, 
              making the original into a kind of religious icon which becomes 
              the focus of cultural pilgrimages almost as intense as the medieval 
              ones. Although we flatter ourselves that we no longer believe in 
              the superstitions that say objects are able to work miracles, this 
              photograph, I think, may suggest we are not so modern and scientific 
              as we think. 
            <p> Which brings me, at long last, to the Web.

            <p> I probably don't need to tell you that the Mona Lisa has a rather 
              high profile on the World Wide Web. The topsey-turvey Monas I show 
              you on the screen are from the Exploratorium in San Francisco, and 
              use the painting to paint a point about the psychology of perception,

              as "Mona Lisa has a nice fruity flavour," "Mona Lisa's skin is thicker 
              and softer than the Cavendish's. Even when it looks bruised and

              in famous images, let me show you this:

              most famous possession. Click on the eyes, and you are transported 
              at last to... 
            <p> <a href="../http://mistral.culture.fr/louvre/francais/musee/collec/monna.htm"target="_top">[Mona 
              Lisa Webpage]</a> 
            <p> ... the true, official, honest-to-goodness Mona Lisa Webpage. 
            <p> There has been much talk since the advent of the web of the "dematerialization" 
              of art objects. One of the points I am making here is that this 
              hasn't happened and isn't likely to happen. This is the good news. 
            <p> What is actually happening is that the meaning of the original 
              art is being modulated by its reproductions, in ways it has in the 
              past by technological developments. The intensification of the "magic" 
              of the original object, which may have more to do with basic human 
              biology than anything rational or scientific, is likely to continue. 
              But, I would submit, other more unexpected things are happening 
              as well. 
            <p> As we have seen in the Mona Lisa webpages, the Web makes it possible, 
              for the first time, for meaning about a single work of art to be 
              expressed by many different people simultaneously to the entire 
              world. This results in a huge overlayering of meaning for these 
              images, a layering that begins to stretch and eventually distort 
              the way people relate to the work itself. None of the meanings we 
              just saw correspond to what Leonardo intended for this work and 
              some of this layering results in bizarre incongruities. The amusement 
              we feel at something like the Mona Lisa banana is, I think, the 
              natural result of the incongruity of seeing an image as simultaneous 
              a beautiful woman, a great painting, and the logo for a type of 
              fruit. 
            <p> The idea of the museum as a place of refuge and contemplation, 
              insulated from the frenzy of the world, is out of fashion these 
              days. It has, however, roots in what I think is an intuited sense 
              of protection: protection for the meaning of the work and protection 
              from the viewer from cultural overload. 
            <p> The web, as anyone knows, has become probably the most frenzied 
              medium ever invented, as this web site should remind us. 
            <p> <a href="../http://www.erols.com/comptom/clinton/index.html"

target="_top">[Clinton scandal webpage]</a> 
            <p> What does it mean to put powerful art images into an environment 
              filled with gossip, sensation, and Clinton Sex Scandals, not to 
              mention "Adult XXX Film Star Mona Lisa's Fantasy Pit"? Does putting 
              great art work on the web invite a variety of Schiller's disease, 
              the strange psychological malady, named after the Romantic German 
              poet, first noted in tourists to Florence. The confusion and disorientation 
              of Schiller's disease suffers has been attributed to just such an 
              overload of cultural meaning as the web provides in abundance. 
            <p> No, I am not advocating an end to museum websites. I am, however, 
              urging a certain amount of caution and suggesting that some psychological 
              and aesthetic space be built into such websites. Since the dawn 
              of history, art images have had a power, a magic, that we nowadays 
              tend to ignore. We should be sure to remind ourselves of this magic 
              when we entered the still uncharted territory of Cyberspace.

              Art. New York: Dover Publications, 1955 (reprint of 1927 edition),

            <p> <a href="#foot2back" name="foot2">2</a>. Dating prehistoric art 
              is notoriously difficult and controversial-many important discoveries, 
              including the famous Altamira caves in 1879, were originally dismissed 
              as hoaxes. The natural entrance to Pech-Merl, however, collapsed 
              around the end of the last Ice Age, sealing the cave art for some 
              9,000 years until they were rediscovered, via man-made tunneling, 
              in the 1920s, some years before the more famous paintings at Lascaux 
              were revealed in 1940. 
            <p> <a href="#foot3back" name="foot3">3</a>. "Parietal art-predominantly 
              on walls and rocks but also on ceilings and floors-is still precisely 
              where the prehistoric artists put it and meant it to be. This is 
              a factor of major importance in the study of its content and significance, 
              not only in terms of landscape but also from the point of view of 
              where on the rock it was placed..." Paul G. Bahn, The Cambridge 
              Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art. Cambridge: Cambridge University 
              Press, 1998, p 99. 
            <p> <a href="#foot4back" name="foot4">4</a>. In talking of Pech-Merle 
              and other prehistoric creations, I use the word "artist" collectively. 
              No one knows who created works such as the "Spotted Horse" or how, 
              but research has suggested that many large and important works were 
              created by more than one hand, perhaps over many generations. 
            <p> <a href="#foot5back" name="foot5">5</a>. "In Europe's Ice Age 
              cave art, the incorporation into images of natural rock or stalagmite 
              forms is common-most famously in the bulging bison bodies on the 
              Altamira ceiling or the spotted horse panel of Pech Merle-while 
              all over the world one can see rock art fitted to natural rock surfaces 
              of different shapes and sizes and images continuing over edges or 
              around corners or linked to cracks and cavities in different ways." 
              Bahn, loc. cit. 
            <p> <a href="#foot6back" name="foot6">6</a>. Bahn carefully points 
              out that, since the prehistoric cultures that made them have long 
              since disappeared, there is no clear scientific way to confirm or 
              deny any interpretation that may be laid on them by modern observers. 
              He does suggest that certain aspects of these works, including their 
              careful placement and their use of natural features, are so obvious 
              that their significance cannot be ignored.

              that human beings in twentieth-century Western societies had mental 
              apparatus more advanced that humans in other cultures. "Some theorists 
              assume a mental equipment of primitive man distinct from that of 
              civilized man, I have never seen a person in primitive life to whom 
              this theory would apply. There are slavish believers in the teachings 
              of the past and there are scoffers and unbelievers; there are clear 
              thinkers and muddleheaded bunglers: there are strong characters
