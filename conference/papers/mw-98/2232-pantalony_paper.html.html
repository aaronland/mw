        face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"> <b>Introduction</b> </font></p>
            <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Museum intellectual property, has 
              become a topic of great interest and vexation to both the museums 
              and their users. For years, museum intellectual property has been 
              used by academic institutions as teaching tools. As technology advanced 
              and museum slides have become digital images, the potential for 
              students to view and museum intellectual property not just in the 
              class room, but on their own time at their own computer terminal, 
              became a reality. As technology advanced, commercial users also 
              realized the positive impact of using museum intellectual property 
              in advertisements, web pages, multimedia presentations and in other 
              promotional material. </font></p>
            <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Advances in technology can, however, 
              act as a double edged sword. Digitized images can be reproduced 
              with greater ease, faster and at higher standards than slides or 
              paper reproductions. Therefore, although technological advances 
              facilitate copying, museums incur greater risks, because they can 
              lose control over and potential economic benefits from their intellectual 
              property. </font></p>
            <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">This paper examines developments 
              in copyright law in Canada, the US and the European Union respecting 
              two of the most common forms of museum intellectual property: images 
              and museum databases. Specifically, what constitutes museum intellectual 
              property? What is the threshold that must be met in order for museum 
              intellectual property to be covered by copyright. In recent years, 
              threshold tests have been further refined by court decisions, or 
              as in the European Union, by legislative Directives. </font></p>
            <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Next, the paper will also look at 
              the needs of users of museum intellectual property. In order to 
              determine what uses are available for licensing, the museum, as 
              manager of intellectual property, should be cognisant of the various 
              exceptions available to both the educational community and the museum 
              community. Finally, direct administration of copyright is compared 
              to collective administration.</font></p>
            <p><a name="mipoverview"><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"></font></a><font
        face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"> <b>Museum Intellectual Property - An Overview</b> 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Traditionally, museums were categorized 
              as users of intellectual property. Works were acquired by museums 
              who sought first to be able to catalogue them, study them, and write 
              about them, discussing their particular importance as part of their 
              respective collections. Museums viewed their collections as primary 
              assets that could not be sold or bartered but are held strictly 
              for the purposes of collecting, studying and for maintaining a record 
              of social development, taste and providing evidence of artistic 
              greatness. Over time, museums acquired a great wealth of knowledge 
              about their respective collections. In keeping with their educational 
              and public service missions, they traded such knowledge with each 
              other <i>and allowed others such as academic institutions to access 
              it</i>. </font></p>
            <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">With technological advances, society 
              has become more visually focussed. Learning techniques changed to 
              include visual resources and commercial users have become cognisant 
              that they could use images to sell goods and services. Such advancements 
              resulted in the awakening of the museum to its own potential wealth 
              of property other than their actual collections which could not 
              be, as mentioned previously, bartered or exchanged on a permanent 
              basis. Museums' knowledge, as recorded by photographs of their collections, 
              databases cataloguing their collections and associated intellectual 
              works discussing collections, has become anew commodity with the 
              potential of commercial and non-commercial exchange. </font><a
        name="return1"><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"></font></a><font
        face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"> However, with the exchange of museum knowledge 
              comes the desire to control use and unauthorized exploitation so 
              that museums can continue to benefit from such exchanges.</font><a href="#1"><font

        face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"> </font></p>
            <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Museums have turned to copyright 
              law to assist them in protecting their information and images. However, 
              does copyright provide a sufficient mechanism to allow both control, 
              continued access and in certain circumstances where beneficial to 
              the museum, economic benefit? </font></p>
            <p><a name="return2"><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"></font></a><font
        face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"> The <i>Berne Convention for the Protection of 
              Literary and Artistic Works</i> (The Berne Convention), is one of 
              the most influential international conventions governing copyright. 
              The Berne Convention, as its full name implies, provides general 
              guidelines with respect to copyright and moral rights governing 
              literary and artistic works.</font><a href="#2"><font

        face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"> The Berne Convention itself is silent on merit, 
              purpose and the concept of authorship so that the quality or standard

            that copyright in a photograph runs for a period of 50 years from 
            the date the negative was made or the photograph was taken. The life 
            of the photographer is not an issue. An anomaly in copyright law, 
            the copyright holder is the person who owns the negative or photograph,

            protection is calculated by determining whether the photograph was 
            taken prior to or after January 1, 1978. If the photograph was taken 
            after January 1, 1978, then copyright subsists in the work for the 
            life of the author plus fifty years after death. If the photograph 
            was taken prior to the above date, the US Copyright Law provides a 
            formula to determine the length of copyright protection. US Copyright 
            law underwent a series of revisions to bring it in line with the Berne

            databases. However, in partial response, to the above case law, a 
            certain degree of originality and creativity will be required in creating 
            the database to obtain such copyright protection. The data itself 
            will not be protected by this Directive. The underlying data will 
            have to depend on traditional copyright legislation for copyright 
            protection. However, copyright in the database will not be dependant 
            upon whether the information contained within attracts copyright protection.

            databases that do not meet the standards in the first part of the

            with the owner of the database (the company or institution that compiled 
            it) being able to control access, use, extractions of information 
            and telecommunication of the database, subject to certain limitations. 
            The language used, allowing certain extractions based on qualitative 
            and quantitative analysis, is still somewhat ambiguous. The duration 
            of such sui generis protection runs for 15 years after the date of 
            completion to January first of the fifteenth year. </font><a name="return26"><font

            was used to created the database. Museums will have to be especially 
            prudent in understanding the risks associated with making certain 
            databases available to the public. Finally, museums should avail themselves 
            of other mechanisms of protection, whether technological or legal,

            and databases are in the educational community. For years, museums 
            have allowed access on a one-to-one basis. Museums responded to requests 
            for slides and reproductions from educational institutions. In many 
            cases, museums requested only nominal payment, thereby, fulfilling 
            their educational and public service missions. Times have changed 
            and overhead costs, administration costs and costs associated with 
            digitization have often forced museums to charge even educational 
            users with a licensing fee. Technological advancements bringing new 
            ways of sharing information have given rise to multiple-point users, 
            thereby necessitating the &quot;site-licensing&quot; agreement. In 
            any event, any use of museum intellectual property necessitates a 
            licensing agreement of sorts. In order for museums to continue to 
            operate efficiently it is helpful if the museum understands not only 
            the type of intellectual property available for licensing but the 
            needs of the educational user in this new technologically fuelled 
            environment. Here are a few helpful tips. </font></p>

        face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"> Once a user establishes that their purpose of 
            using a work falls into one of the above categories, the user must 
            also determine if the proposed use of a work is fair. The test is 
            based upon whether a substantial part of the work is being used and 
            if so, then whether copying such a substantial part of the work would 
            in any way diminish the quality of the work or increase the quantity

          <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Throughout this discussion, it is assumed 
            that museums are negotiating and managing their intellectual property 
            directly with their users. This requires the museum to not only become 
            expert at managing maintaining their intellectual property but it 
            also requires the museum professional to become expert at negotiating 
            licensing agreements. For some museums, well versed in such areas 
            with established licensing procedures, this is not an issue. Ultimately, 
            direct licensing provides the museum with complete control over the 
            use of their intellectual property and the licensing fees they can 
            charge. On the other hand, for the inexperienced or smaller museum, 
            licensing issues and associated overhead costs create administrative 
            burdens that may have the ultimate effect of hindering accessibility 
            to museum information. By impeding access, the museum becomes counterproductive, 
            working against its own public service and educational missions. Therefore, 
            direct licensing will work for only some of the participants, some 
            of the time. </font></p>

            </font></p>
          <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">In Canada, the US and in Europe, collective 
            administration of copyright has become well established. Traditional 
            to the music industry, copyright holders often join forces, based 
            genre of work and other common objectives, such as policy or economics, 
            and form associations to which they assign their copyright to be licensed. 
            These associations, known as collective societies, become responsible 
            for licensing the works assigned, collecting the royalties and redistributing 
            them according to accepted formulae. </font></p>
          <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">By comparison, The US system of collective 
            administration is less regulated than its Canadian counterpart. In 
            The US, collectives may operate so long as they do not violate anti-trust 
            laws. In Canada, by contrast, anti-competition laws are not applicable 
            so long as collective societies attorn to the jurisdiction of the 
            Copyright Board, a quasi-judicial body holding vast powers. </font><a name="return38"><font
        face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"></font></a><font
        face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"> Such powers include the ability to arbitrate 
            licensing fees at the request of either party, set tariffs (licensing 
            fees) for performing rights societies as a matter of law without the 
            request of either party and impose decisions concerning provisions 
            of licensing agreements that affect the royalty fees associated with 
            the authorized uses of copyright material.</font><a href="#38"><font

          <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Notwithstanding the jurisdictional 
            differences, collective societies provide copyright holders and may 
            indeed provide museums, with certain benefits. First, such societies 
            take over the licensing process so that museums are not burdened with 
            the high overhead and administration concerns associated with direct 
            licensing. Second, collective societies create economies of scale 
            so that licensing fees become more reasonable, and therefore, museum 
            intellectual property becomes more accessible. Finally, collective 
            societies operate on the premise that their members share the objectives 
            of the collective society both monetary and non-monetary.</font></p>
          <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Collective administration of museum 
            copyright has been contemplated since the early 1990s and museum collective 
            societies have been and are in the process of being formed. However, 
            before museums join collective societies, it may be beneficial for 
            them to consider the following factors: </font></p>
          <ol>
            <li><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Does your museum agree with or hold 
              similar overall policy (such as educational or public service policies) 
              or economic objectives that are held by the collective society in 
              question? Copyright holders that do not share common objectives 
              with each other or with their collective society cannot co-exist 
              peaceably. </font></li>
            <li><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Will your museum actually reduce 
              administrative costs or will monitoring practices still require 
              museums to perform many administrative tasks? Some collective societies 
              are not vigilant in their own monitoring practices or do not report 
              back to their members regularly, thereby requiring individual members 
              to monitor their own collective societies. </font></li>
            <li><a name="return39"><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"></font></a><font
                face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"> Does the collective require exclusive 
              representation of your collection? Exclusive representation means 
              effectively that the museum loses control over the use of its copyrighted 
              works. Exclusive representation is not recommended by scholars and 
              theorists in collective administration.</font><a

            <li><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">If your museum intends to continue 
              direct licensing practices, is it still worth joining a collective 
              to either enhance exposure or for specific licensing purposes? A 
              cost benefit analysis should be undertaken to determine whether 
              museum overhead costs are in fact reduced as a result of joining 
              a collective society. </font></li>
            <li><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">What is the nature of the relationship 
              between the collective society and its members? Is it based upon 
              an assignment of copyright or is it based upon an assignment to 
              collect and redistribute potential royalties. Do museum members 
              play a large enough role in the management of the collective? </font></li>
          </ol>
          <p><a name="conclusion"><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"></font></a><font
        face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"> <b>Conclusion</b> </font></p>
          <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Museum administrators and professionals 
            are being subjected to a volatile legal system trying to play catch-up 
            to advances in technology. The law concerning the protection of digital 
            information, including digitized images and databases is in a state 
            of flux. Only time will determine the extent of protection afforded 
            to such types of intellectual property. In the meantime, museums are 
            faced with using other technological mechanisms or contract law to 
            try and protect their intellectual property from being illicitly copied. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">In order to maintain a working relationship 
            with their users in such a disconcerting environment, museums should 
            try and understand the requirements of their users. Notably educational 
            users hold particular requirements that must be addressed in their 
            licensing agreements. This environment requires that museum professionals 
            dealing with licensing issues on a regular basis keep abreast of the 
            changes in teaching techniques and technology so that their users' 
            needs are appropriately understood and taken into account. </font></p>
          <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Exceptions to copyright, fair use and 
            fair dealing also impact upon the parameters of the licensing agreement. 
            It remains unclear to what extent fair use and fair dealing apply 
            to digitized information. Therefore, museum professionals are faced 
            with subjective decision making while trying to interpret fair use 
            and fair dealing. </font></p>
          <p><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Finally, legal systems may provide 
            for a more streamlined approach to licensing museum intellectual property. 
            The advent of collective administration of copyright may hold some 
            respite from the administrative burdens associated with licensing 
            intellectual property. Museums may want to undertake cost benefit 
            analyses before joining a collective society. Several other factors 
            should be considered as well, including the objectives of the collective 
            society, the overall benefits of membership and the relationship the 
            collective society has with its members. </font></p>
