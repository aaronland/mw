          <h4><a href="#toc" name="intro">Introduction</a></h4>
          <p>I distinctly remember as a boy of eleven my mother arriving home 
            one night with a number of very heavy boxes and on opening them finding 
            a set of World Book encyclopaedias (from the US). To this day I remember 
            their smell, their glossy smooth paper and I remember the sense of 
            discovery every time I opened a volume. Of course it was not always 
            plain sailing. Their entries were sometimes insufficient, other times 
            too complex and often the chase through numerous other volumes to 
            find cross-referenced material was more like a broken-link than a 
            hot-link. </p>
          <p>Whilst the World Book was wonderful for me then, I grew into needing 
            the Britannica. It was bigger, the articles more substantive and it 
            had, what we did not call in those days, an international brand name 
            that money can’t buy. Britannica is a source of information held in 
            the highest regard, its brand name is one of the most recognisable 
            academic icons of the western world and one would have thought with 
            its pedigree that it was unassailable. Then along came computers, 
            the World Wide Web and Microsoft’s CD ROM Encyclopaedia, Encarta. 
          </p>
          <p>The unthinkable happened, Britannica’s sales of its bound volumes 
            halved this decade, forcing it into losses. With Encarta selling for 
            $50, and sometimes given away with new computers, Britannica was forced 
            to rethink its sales strategies and one-product policy. In Australia, 
            its sales staff of 120 was disbanded, it produced a CD ROM version 
            of its encyclopaedia and created an online presence to complement 
            the CD ROM and encyclopaedia. The delivery was opened up to include 
            direct marketing, major retailers and educational institutions. <i>(from 
            The Australian newspaper, 15/1/98 p.24)</p></I>
          <p>Is there any message in this for museums? Is it irrelevant or are 
            you in the information business too? Do you have a respected brand 
            name? Do you still rely on the same means of delivering your services 
            as you always have? Do you deliver the same services as you always 
            have? Do you regard your institution’s name and standing as being 
            of high repute and its longevity a sure thing? The management of Britannica 
            would have said yes to all of these questions only a handful of years 
            ago! </p>
          <p>I believe the message for the management of museums is: if have not 
            got a well devised and implemented online strategy then you risk having 
            your institution marginalised and eventually put out to pasture. In 
            terms of the theme in which this paper is to be presented: the presence 
            of museums on the web doesn’t just make sense, it is an imperative. 
            If management fails to utilise the World Wide Web to improve access 
            and equity of access to its collection; if it fails to employ digitisation 
            programs to maximise preservation and collection management; if it 
            fails to add value to its collection in this age of information; and 
            if it fails to train its staff adequately and resource the new business 
            appropriately then one day management may just wake up to find that 
            its collection is no longer sought after nor supported by government 
            and the private sector and its business is no longer viable. </p>
          <p>This paper contends that the online world is rapidly changing the 
            expectations of the consumer and that whilst museums have an obligation 
            to preserve the national heritage and culture, they also have an obligation 
            to provide optimum access to their collections. Those museums that 
            do not digitise and deliver online will lose market share to those 
            that do and those that may have enjoyed a curatorial superiority may 
            well slip behind those that read what the market wants and provide 
            it. How will funding be determined in the world of online collections? 
            Who will get the lion’s share of the funding? I would put my money 
            on those museums that have a sound online strategy that is producing 
            visible results – that provide photo opportunities for politicians!</p>
          <p>This paper draws heavily from a report I prepared for the Australian 
            government, with assistance from a lawyer Mark Minarelli, entitled 
            Digitisation of Collections. The report was tabled in December 1996 
            and dealt with the public policy issues that the federal government 
            would need to consider as museums, libraries, art galleries and archives 
            digitise their collections and made them available online. </p>
          <p>In this paper I will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>outline what I believe are the major online agents of change 
            <li>explore the character and nature of that change; and 
            <li>provide some suggestions as to how museums might best manage change.

          <h4><a href="#toc" name="online">Online Agents of Change</a></h4>
          <p>This section presents the proposition that the Internet is here to 
            stay and that its characteristics, what it enables us to do and the 
            expectations it creates make it a powerful agent of change.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="tech">New technologies</a></h4>
          <p>We are living in the middle of a revolution in the way in which we 
            handle, swap and trade information. Just as the industrial revolution 
            was spurred on by a machine - a steam pump - so too is a machine at 
            the heart of the information revolution: the computer. The early 1980’s 
            saw the beginnings of this revolution - it was in 1982 that Time Magazine 
            announced its Time Man Of The Year: the Personal Computer. </p>
          <p>Information technology, multimedia and the Internet now receive enormous 
            press coverage and by now are terms known to most people in developed 
            countries. The uptake of these new technologies has been rapid and 
            the number of participants keeps growing. These are not fads; they 
            will not go away because they are increasingly commercially driven 
            and they are powerful business and education tools. </p>
          <p>Most computers sold this year are expected to be sold with additional 
            hardware (modems) and software that will put their users on the Net. 
            The implications of this for museums is that, since their customers 
            are using the new technologies, it will not be long before they will 
            expect to be able to access catalogues, records and collections electronically.</p>
          <p>Whether museums like it or not, the growing power and functionality 
            of modern technologies are creating an unprecedented demand for information 
            and an increasing expectation that access will be quick, easy and 
            affordable but more of this later in this paper. The emphasis will 
            be far more towards demand driven criteria as opposed to supply driven.</p>
          <p>Public demand in this brave new world is poised to redefine how curators 
            package, market and manage the collections they hold on behalf of 
            the public that pays their wages through taxes and entrance fees.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="access">The tools of access</a></h4>
          <p>The computers, modems and software now available to users to search, 
            vet, view, edit and reproduce content from on-line digital archives 
            are more powerful, relatively less expensive and more flexible than 
            ever before. Improvements continue to unfold on a monthly basis. The 
            purchase of multimedia and Internet equipped personal computers by 
            households is growing which means more and more people will have the 
            capacity to access digital archives via the Internet. </p>
          <p>By the year 2000, there will be very few workplaces and schools in 
            developed countries without access to at least one computer with the 
            capacity to access the Internet. </p>
          <p>The function of computers themselves is set to undergo sophisticated 
            changes. Many observers believe that the television and computer will 
            merge into one unit offering interactive live video, audio, video-conferencing 
            plus even more computer power than we have today. The TV-PC will offer 
            unparalleled opportunities to communicate with one another and power 
            to access and view content on the Internet.</p>
          <p>Network PCs are mooted as the next paradigm shift in personal computer 
            architecture. These computers will be linked permanently to the Internet 
            from where they will derive all of their application software and 
            where they will store information. These devices will cost less than 
            personal computers - recently released models are selling for about 
            $1000. </p>
          <p>That major computer companies are designing and releasing PC/TVs 
            and Network Computers, and that computer sales and Internet access 
            continue to grow monthly, provide further evidence, if any were needed, 
            that the Internet will play an increasingly important role in education, 
            entertainment, training and commerce in the foreseeable future. And 
            there can be little doubt that the number of people using the Internet 
            worldwide will represent a substantial market for on-line digital 
            content.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="security">Security</a></h4>
          <p>One of the impediments to the use of the Internet for commercial 
            transactions has been the real concern over security of those transactions. 
            This stumbling block is being rapidly broken down by the likes of 
            Visa, Mastercard and American Express who have been co-operating to 
            produce standards and procedures for the use of credit cards on the 
            Internet. Meanwhile software giants such as Microsoft and Oracle have 
            been developing encryption technology to ensure the safe transport 
            of credit card numbers across the Net. </p>
          <p>Banks are increasingly forcing customers into online banking as it 
            is so much cheaper for them than across-the-counter banking. Of this 
            we can be certain: both demand and supply led initiatives to purchase 
            products and services across the Internet paid for by credit card 
            and/or electronic cash will increase at an exponential rate from 1998 
            onwards. </p>
          <p>Where does this leave your organisation? What policy have you in 
            place to be ready, to avoid being marginalised? </p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="delivering">Delivering digital archives</a></h4>
          <p>At present content on the Internet is delivered to most users via 
            the telephone network. The cables that carry the data are made of 
            copper wire and were designed to deliver voice data yet have proven 
            capable of delivering fax data, colour still images, animations, &quot;live&quot; 
            audio and even video (though of an unsatisfactory frame-rate and quality). 
          </p>
          <p>By using fibre optic cable (broadband) instead of copper wire, it 
            is possible to deliver video, audio and animations of very high quality 
            along with all other forms of data at very high speed and at great 
            volumes. Telecommunications companies in Australia and North America 
            are establishing broadband services in major cities in order to provide 
            a superior service and to increase income as a result of increased 
            traffic on their network. There is every reason to believe their expectation 
            that consumers will quickly adapt to the quality of reproduction, 
            speed and interactivity made possible by fibre-optic cable and cease 
            to be content with anything of a lesser quality. They will increase 
            their usage of the network as they are lured by the quality and quantity 
            of material available to them.</p>
          <p>This capacity, coupled with the increasing power of computers used 
            to access the Internet, offers the challenge to employ the highest 
            of technical standards for on-line access to digital libraries. </p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="finding">Finding and navigating digital archives</a></h4>
          <p>Electronic finding aids are becoming increasingly sophisticated enabling 
            surfers to enjoy a high degree of success in finding what they are 
            looking for. World Wide Web search engines will take users to the 
            front door of the digital archive, but it is the finding aid that 
            assists them navigate through the archive. Overseas projects, such 
            as the MIT Media Lab Salient Movie and those at University of California, 
            Berkeley are researching and developing sophisticated finding aids. 
          </p>
          <p>As finding online digital archives and then exploring them becomes 
            easier and more widely adopted, any museum’s archives can be found. 
            This has quite a profound impact on museums. It effectively means 
            that any digital archive no matter where it might be, no matter what 
            its pedigree or quality will be found and accessed by users where-ever 
            they might be in the world. Will the user care whether the information 
            came from a webserver sitting inside the Met, Ashmolian, Museum of 
            Singapore or from a private webserver sitting in an enthusiast’s home 
            who has become a self-styled, self-made curator of a fabulous digital 
            collection of 19<sup>th</sup> century Dutch porcelain?</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="democracy">Democracy and online content</a></h4>
          <p>The rapidly growing number of technology-enabled consumers in developed 
            nations is creating a vast pool of people seeking information in digital 
            format in the areas of education, training and entertainment. There 
            is every indication that governments and numerous public and private 
            organisations will also increasingly expect access to information 
            in electronic format held by museums such as public record offices, 
            archives and libraries. </p>
          <p>Access to digital collections via the Internet liberates consumers 
            from the restrictions of place and time - the walls and doors of our 
            museums. It brings the collection to the consumer rather than the 
            consumer to the museum. The act of making collections available on-line 
            has a number of favourable outcomes.</p>
          <p>On-line collections are accessible to those who for reasons of location, 
            physical disability, working hours, or nature of their work are unable 
            to physically visit a collecting institution during its normal hours 
            of opening. In addition to this group are those who become stressed 
            in public or who simply find visiting institutions too difficult or 
            inconvenient.</p>
          <p>The Internet has now made it possible for consumers to be collectors 
            and curators of their own virtual museum, library or gallery. Whereas 
            it has always been the decision of the collecting institutions’ management 
            as to what was placed on the walls, shelves, cases and interactive 
            multimedia kiosks and what special exhibitions will be mounted, the 
            consumer is now increasingly empowered to make those decisions as 
            well - the walls, shelves and cases are inside the desktop computer, 
            wherever that might be. </p>
          <p>The consumer empowered with the choice of content opens new possibilities 
            for the public and an opportunity for museums as a whole. Consumers 
            will be able mount their own collections, drawing on images from anywhere 
            in the world. The most popular sources of images are likely to demonstrate 
            the following characteristics (not in order of importance) :</p>
          <ul>
            <li>is very well known 
            <li>has a superior number of images from which to choose 
            <li>has a highly effective search engine, intuitive navigation design 
              and an extremely user-friendly interface 
            <li>provides images of an appropriate quality 
            <li>is fairly priced 
            <li>offers more relevant and accessible information on each item than 
              other sites 
          </ul>
          <p>If for no other reason, museums will be compelled to digitise their 
            collections and make them available online because the public and 
            government agencies will increasingly demand electronic access to 
            their collections. Institutions will need to develop strategies to 
            balance public demand with such things as the owners’ rights, cost 
            of digitising and availability of resources.</p>
          <p>Major museums that do not embark on an effective and efficient online 
            program will become increasingly marginalised as consumers, both public 
            and government, become accustomed to accessing digital collections 
            wherever they can be found in the world. </p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="better">Doing traditional tasks better</a></h4>
          <p>Not all agents of change come from outside the museum world. Many 
            within the museum sector are turning to digitisation and digital archiving 
            as tools that enable them to do their traditional jobs more effectively 
            and efficiently.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="collection">Collection management</a></h4>
          <p>Many institutions are viewing the digitisation of their collections 
            for online consumption as an opportunity to adopt new and more effective 
            collection management strategies and practices. </p>
          <p>For many institutions the digitisation process will help reveal the 
            extent and actual contents of their collections. </p>
          <p>Once an institution embarks on a digitisation programme it is likely 
            that a number of in-house benefits will emerge. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>research by curators and in-house specialists will be made easier 
              and more effective 
            <li>conservation of material will gain a new emphasis and will be 
              enhanced 
            <li>the necessary cataloguing and resulting image bank of the collection 
              will provide valuable collection management information 
          </ul>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="preservation">Preservation</a></h4>
          <p>The preservation of our cultural heritage is a corner-stone of enabling 
            charters and vision statements of most museums. </p>
          <p>The digitisation of cultural items and the resultant digital archives 
            offer some obvious and potentially powerful aids to preservation.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>handling and use of original items is minimised thereby reducing 
              the possibility of damage from mishap, overuse or exposure to hostile 
              environments 
            <li>the digital image provides a backup copy (or copies) of the original 
            <li>digitisation can offer an immediate replacement strategy for items 
              that are on the verge of complete deterioration - such as film and 
              sound archives 
          </ul>
          <p>Digitisation may offer an additional but less direct boost to preservation 
            efforts. Assuming the digitised images are available via on-line services 
            then wider public access to items may increase awareness of our cultural 
            heritage. These potential outcomes would validate and possibly help 
            fund further efforts to preserve that heritage through digitisation 
            and other methods of preservation.</p>
          <p>However, such benefits will only be enjoyed when a number of conditions 
            are met. The digitisation process must be of appropriate quality, 
            it has to be managed effectively and the resulting images must be 
            stored, indexed and catalogued effectively. At present, meeting these 
            fundamental conditions is proving elusive due to funding problems, 
            technical shortcomings and the absence of recognised management standards 
            and protocols. </p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="change">The Character of Change</a></h4>
          <p>Having examined the major agents of change, what are the fundamental 
            characteristics of that change? What is changing? What will be the 
            impact on museums? What assumptions have we always made about museums 
            that need re-thinking? (Aspects of this section of the paper were 
            researched and developed by Mark Minarelli in our Digitisation of 
            Collections report)</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="business">Museums as businesses</a></h4>
          <p>It may seem too obvious a statement to make, but almost all museums 
            were established in the pre-World Wide Web world. As a result their 
            charter, mission statements and the expectations of their management 
            and in some cases boards, do not take into account, in any formal 
            sense, the online world. Charters and mission statements tend to presuppose 
            traditional functions and a physical location only in which objects 
            or material are displayed and to which the public is permitted access. 
            Institutions are frequently, therefore, not well served or adequately 
            guided by the legislative frameworks or guiding missions within which 
            they live. </p>
          <p>Pressure is being exerted on most museums to become more profitable; 
            to recover costs where possible and to be less reliant on the public 
            purse. However, often their charters do not cater well for profit-making 
            ventures and in many cases, the public benefit purpose is not clearly 
            defined in their legislation or mission statements and in a period 
            of profound change this will fundamentally disadvantage the institutions. 
          </p>
          <p>The agents of change discussed in the previous section will pushing 
            museums into new business models and they will have to respond or 
            wither. Being a business will necessitate changed organisational structures, 
            skills and strategies. While technological change is one of the key 
            features driving the transition of museums into businesses and the 
            convergence of institutions, the challenge will be to not allow technology 
            to dictate the agenda, but rather to use the technology to give new 
            meaning to the role of museums.</p>
          <p>An important issue for the museums is to delineate clearly, in consultation 
            with governments, their owners and each other, the dilemma between 
            their traditional non-profit public benefit role and more commercial 
            arrangements needed to achieve the potential of the online world.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="branding">Branding &amp; marketing museums</a></h4>
          <p>Users searching for information on the Internet have two main search 
            methods at their disposal: a global search using search engines such 
            as Lycos, Magellan and Yahoo; and a known URL (uniform resource locater) 
            such as www.nla.gov.au (our National Library’s World Wide Web site). 
            The former lists all registered sites on the Internet world-wide that 
            claim to hold information on the search topic, whilst the latter takes 
            the user directly to a site they believe may hold the information. 
          </p>
          <p>Combine this with the current and ever-growing predominance of content 
            from North American collections and it is reasonable to assert that 
            searches for information on say, endangered species, will result in 
            finding content held predominantly by North American institutions. 
            What ultimate impact will this have on museums in countries such as 
            Australia, Malaysia, Belgium where the size of population and economy, 
            and the relatively small number of museums mean that they will be 
            pouring much less digital content into the world wide reservoir of 
            digital content. Will they be able to compete for the surfer’s custom, 
            but more importantly, for his or her money? </p>
          <p>To compound matters, when choosing URLs, users will select the institution 
            that either comes to mind most readily or one that they have used 
            before (and bookmarked it), often because it was found using a search 
            engine. Thus brand-names such as, Oxford, Smithsonian and the Louvre 
            will prove difficult to compete against - just as soft-drink manufacturers 
            around the world, other than Coke, find much to their dismay that 
            most people think of Coke when they think of soft-drink. </p>
          <p>A World Wide Web site if not marketed appropriately becomes a small 
            desert island in a large ocean - people only find it if they stray 
            off course on their way to the well known ports. Users are lured by 
            marketing ploys and sheer critical mass of content to the large sites, 
            the large ports, and only visit the smaller sites, those small desert 
            island, if they know they exist. A challenge for the museums is to 
            develop a strategy that ensures that their online collections do not 
            become desert islands.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="want">What do users want?</a></h4>
          <p>Much of the discussion thus far has centred on digitisation from 
            the institutions’ point of view. But what of the end user of the digital 
            archives; what are their expectations and needs and how might this 
            impact on the way museums approach online solutions?</p>
          <p>There has been no thorough market research conducted across Australia 
            into what the end-user wants from a cultural digital archive in terms 
            of content, interaction, design, accessibility, cost and value-added 
            services and what the likely patterns of use will be. </p>
          <p>At the risk of being proved wrong by subsequent research, I would 
            suggest that users want a one-stop-shop World Wide Web site that meets 
            all their research requirements for content held by collecting institutions. 
            They do not want to visit each institution’s web site. They want to 
            search for a topic and be presented with a list of digital objects 
            (text, photos, video, sound) that they can download and for which 
            copyright payment, should any be required, can be made easily and 
            once only for all the items downloaded.</p>
          <p>If museums fail to identify and meet consumer needs in this regard 
            then they risk losing them to the on-line digital archives of other 
            institutions whether they be in Glasgow, Sydney or Penang.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="value">Value Adding</a></h4>
          <p>I believe that value-adding is the single most important activity 
            a museum can undertake to remain viable in the online world. By value-adding 
            to a digital object I mean providing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>additional information to that which has been available to the 
              general public physically visiting the museum – eg extensive historical 
              context, detailed provenance, links to other objects in the collection, 
              hotlinks to other relevant digital collections 
            <li>multiple access points – give virtual visitors numerous opportunities 
              to find objects in the collection and to realise links between objects 
            <li>new ways of experiencing an object – eg. using holograms and 3-D 
              effects; rotating an object giving multiple viewing points; using 
              audio and visual to provide stimuli and information; animating or 
              recreating the context of the object’s original existence 
            <li>additional services – eg helpdesks, ability to download the object 
              in multiple formats, copyright information, other museums with similar 
              collections, reference books and journals relevant to the object 
          </ul>
          <p>If all a museum does is make available online digital copies of items 
            in its collection without value-adding to them in the manner described 
            above then it will be bypassed by the user of the 21<sup>st</sup> 
            century. They want more information and stimulus, faster and more 
            easily accessed than most museums are currently offering. Those that 
            get it right in the 21<sup>st</sup> century will succeed; those that 
            don’t will be marginalised.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="care">Is it a museum, library, gallery? Does 
            the consumer care?</a></h4>
          <p>The very nature of the Internet breaks down walls and geographical 
            boundaries rendering the institutional source of the information of 
            little consequence to the user who is almost solely concerned with 
            obtaining the information he or she is seeking. As Boyd Rayward (says 
            in his, <i>Libraries, Museums and Archives in the Digital Future: 
            The Blurring of Institutional Boundaries</p></I>
          <blockquote>&quot;Libraries, museums and archives in our society have 
            emerged over the centuries as important organisational components 
            of what I have called society’s information infrastructure. Their 
            roles and functions, as they have developed over this period, are 
            the expression of a variety of cultural and social practices related 
            to education, research, artistic creativity, entertainment and recreation. 
            Until recently the distinctive differences between libraries, museums 
            and archives have rested in part on the formats of the typical artefacts 
            that have been accepted as their special province. Specialised techniques 
            have been required to manage these different formats. These techniques 
            have created organisationally prescribed ways of using the artefacts 
            by the various clienteles permitted access to them but something was 
            lost in these immense gains of organisational sophistication. What 
            has developed does not reflect the needs of an individual scholar 
            or member of the educated public interested in some aspect of learning 
            or life. For the individual the ideal is still the personal cabinet 
            of curiosities that contains whatever is needed for a particular purpose 
            or to respond to a particular interest, irrespective of the nature 
            of the artefacts involved - books, objects, data, personal papers, 
            recorded image, government files.&quot;</blockquote>
          <p>If we accept that those using the Internet to seek information have 
            little concern whether the information has come from an art gallery, 
            museum or say archive, only that they have access to it and that the 
            content has integrity and is reasonably priced, then this has significant 
            ramifications for the place of museums in a digital age and for their 
            digitisation strategies. Should joint ventures between collecting 
            institutions be pursued – on a profit-making basis?</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="identity">Promoting national identity – who 
            else will do it?</a></h4>
          <p>I can best explain this issue by an example close to home. Australians 
            seeking content for research purposes or just personal interest have 
            historically turned to their local libraries, museums, art galleries 
            and archives. Venture into any Australian museum today and you will 
            find that their collections include both Australian and non-Australian 
            content, with the latter sometimes being greater than the former. 
          </p>
          <p>Now consider the size of the digital archives being developed in 
            North America and Europe for on-line consumption and the integrity 
            of digital archives that will be offered on-line by the likes of The 
            British Museum and the Smithsonian. The non- native Australian content 
            held and digitised by Australian museums will be overwhelmed by sheer 
            weight of the digital offerings emanating from the Northern Hemisphere 
            and by world recognised centres of academic excellence. As researchers 
            in Australia shift their mode of research increasingly to on-line 
            sources they will find most of their non-Australian content coming 
            from these bountiful overseas sources, which in turn will render the 
            physical holdings of non-Australian content accessed less and less. 
          </p>
          <p>Should museums therefore continue to collect, hold and/or digitise 
            non-native content? Shouldn’t they concentrate their resources on 
            collecting, digitising and adding value to content native to their 
            land, heritage and culture? If they don’t, who will?</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="managing">Managing Change</a></h4>
          <p>The two previous sections of this paper examined the major agents 
            of change and the fundamental characteristics of that change. This 
            final section looks at how museums can best manage change. That is, 
            how they might best adapt to operating in an online world which will 
            see the differentiation between collecting institutions blur and competition 
            from museums, libraries and galleries from around the world increase 
            dramatically.</p>
          <p>That the digital age is moving museums into new business models is 
            a major tenet of this paper. It would be a mistake, however, to think 
            that institutions were moving from one static, definable paradigm 
            to another static paradigm. The truth is that there will always be 
            change. Once that is recognised, museums can set about developing 
            strategies to transform the challenges of change into opportunities. 
          </p>
          <p>If the transformation process is not dealt with appropriately it 
            has the potential to disorientate institutions and their staff causing 
            unnecessary stress, ineffective responses and lost opportunities. 
            However, with the right preparation and appropriate change management 
            strategies museums can be the masters of change rather than its servants. 
          </p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="equip">Equipping management for the digital 
            age</a></h4>
          <p>The digitisation of collections and public access to digital archives 
            will, in the long term, have a fundamental impact on the functions 
            and functioning of collecting institutions. It is likely that departments 
            and managerial positions will be re-fashioned and/or new ones formed 
            to deal with such things as digitisation programs, copyright and commercial 
            issues and maintaining digital archives. Those departments and managers 
            currently operating in museums will most likely be undertaking quite 
            different tasks, using new tools and responding to different sets 
            of priorities and new demands ranging from the curatorial to the commercial.</p>
          <p>An effective and efficient transition from the present to the time 
            when consumers will be able to access a significant portion of national 
            collections on-line requires significant enterprise, collaboration, 
            skill and vision on the part of the management of collecting institutions. 
            Management will need to give of their time and exercise their expertise 
            in contemplating and finding solutions to the myriad of management 
            issues amongst which are: the re-deployment of human and physical 
            resources; budgeting for digitisation; staff training; acquisition 
            and maintenance of new equipment; the preservation of digital objects, 
            prioritising what to digitise; and maintaining current projects. Management 
            may need to acquire new sets of skills in order that they might deal 
            appropriately with the new issues associated with a digital world.</p>
          <p>Given the scope of this new undertaking and the existing commitments 
            of management, it will be highly desirable to establish methods of 
            encouraging and supporting professional development in appropriate 
            areas for management and to explore support mechanisms that will minimise 
            the burden of change and maximise the efficiency of the transition.</p>
          <p>The methods and mechanism that might be employed in this regard:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>workshops conducted on issues such as: risk management, change 
              management, ownership/copyright, managing staff training, budgeting 
              for digitisation 
            <li>the publication and dissemination of national and international 
              best practice case-studies 
            <li>an Internet site devoted to the publication and dissemination 
              of professional development material including open discussion groups 
              establishment of regional management reference groups that meet 
              to promote collaboration and sharing of experiences and lessons 
              learnt at a regional level 
            <li>a register of projects currently under way or planned in museums 
            <li>a register of consultants organised according to the services 
              they provide 
          </ul>
          <p>The provision of effective professional development appropriate to 
            the new service in which management will find themselves requires 
            appropriate needs analysis, planning, resourcing, constant evaluation 
            and commitment.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="prevailing">The prevailing management environment</a></h4>
          <p>The managers of museums hold key positions in the decision-making 
            process with regard to their online policies. However, it is a point 
            of fact that most managers of museums, like managers of most similar 
            sized commercial organisations, grew up in the pre-information technology 
            age and certainly the pre-World Wide Web age. For most, their schooling 
            and professional training pre-dates electronic calculators, word processors 
            and fax machines. They were taught and accessed information in what 
            are now termed, <i>traditional </i>methods, and they mainly disseminated 
            their ideas on paper. </p>
          <p>In short, managers of our museums did not grow up in our current 
            information age; rather, they are in the process of adapting to it 
            with varying degrees of willingness and success. The speed and all-embracing 
            nature of this revolution challenges managers to anticipate the changes 
            and to adapt themselves and their organisations appropriately.</p>
          <p>It must be said that the successful transition to the online world 
            and to new business models by each museums will depend to a large 
            extent on the degree to which managers re-skill and on their vision 
            of the future.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="risk">Risk management</a></h4>
          <p>Digitisation of content and management of digital objects will bring 
            with it certain obligations and potential liabilities. If we characterise 
            the obligations and potential liabilities as risks it should be acknowledged 
            that these risks need to be identified and then managed.</p>
          <p>A risk analysis should seek to examine, for potential or actual failure 
            to meet obligations, the procedures and protocols adopted by the institution 
            as it undertakes each of the following aspects of creating an online 
            digital archive:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>budgeting 
            <li>prioritisation 
            <li>staff training 
            <li>purchase of hardware and software 
            <li>allocation of resources 
            <li>the digitisation of physical objects 
            <li>copyright and ownership 
            <li>indexing and cataloguing 
            <li>storage medium 
            <li>migration of digital objects 
            <li>provision of access to digital objects 
          </ul>
          <p>Once the risks have been identified risk management systems can be 
            introduced with the aim of any one or all of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>eliminating or reducing risks; 
            <li>sharing risks; 
            <li>and/or transferring risks. 
          </ul>
          <p>Managers of museums will require support and direction in identifying 
            aspects of their institution’s digitisation process that require application 
            of risk management procedures. They will also require expert advice 
            and would benefit from the collective experience of their colleagues 
            when selecting and applying risk management policies.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="staff">Staff training</a></h4>
          <p>Just as managers of museums will require well targeted professional 
            development to help manage their institutions effectively in the digital 
            age so too will their staff require specific training in new disciplines 
            and techniques. Institutions will require staff whose combined skill-sets 
            embrace, in the right combination, the following functions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>preservation, archiving and disposal of digital objects 
            <li>cataloguing and indexing digital objects 
            <li>preparing objects for digitisation 
            <li>the use of online navigational tools and finding aids 
            <li>the monitoring of digitisation procedures and performing of quality 
              reviews 
            <li>preparation of detailed instructions for digitisation - whether 
              in-house or outsourced 
            <li>technical knowhow in operating digitisation hardware and software 
            <li>web graphic design and authoring 
            <li>webserver technical expertise 
            <li>online marketing strategies and e-commerce 
          </ul>
          <p>The training of personnel to perform these functions requires a coordinated 
            national approach in every country similar to that suggested for the 
            professional development of management. </p>
          <p>Within nations and cities the sharing of human resources between 
            institutions that are in close physical proximity of one-another is 
            a resourcing strategy that has much to recommend it and deserves careful 
            consideration. The sharing may take the form of an individual or team 
            that has particular skills in one or several aspects of digitisation 
            consulting to all museums in a capital city or region. In addition, 
            another model may see staff in one institution with specialist expertise 
            in their cultural sector consult to that sector on a national basis. 
            Possible advantages of these collaborative models are: the fast-tracking 
            of online programs; the utilisation of best-practice by all participating 
            institutions; and the dissemination of knowledge and skills which 
            will increase the national pool of skilled personnel. An alternative 
            is the establishment of at least one all-round skilled person who 
            works solely in the one collecting institution. This approach is based 
            on the premise that a rapport with staff, availability and an intimate 
            understanding of the institution’s ethos and vision are essential 
            ingredients in successful consulting and cannot easily be achieved 
            if the consultant is operating from outside the institution.</p>
          <p>As with so many issues raised in this paper, it is unlikely that 
            one approach will serve the needs of all. A successful resolution 
            to this issue is more likely to reside in an approach that recognises 
            the differing circumstances between institutions themselves and which 
            offers various models for the timely provision of suitably trained 
            staff.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="market">Know thy market and then differentiate</a></h4>
          <p>In the online world, competition amongst museums for home page hits 
            and for securing customers for digital archives will be intense. And 
            it is not just the museum down the road that will be the competitor 
            to watch but the Getty, Louvre, Victoria &amp; Albert – the competition 
            is any museum, anywhere in the world that has gone online. To compete, 
            museums will need to develop differentiators that separate them from 
            the pack. Value-added services, effective web-site design, pricing 
            of digital objects and marketing are all key elements in differentiating 
            one digital archive from another. </p>
          <p>Differentiating requires market intelligence. Museums have to get 
            to know what the market wants – what objects in the collection will 
            people be most interested in (this should instruct the prioritisation 
            policy for digitisation of the collection), what are the price-points, 
            what value-added services do people want and how can they be brought 
            back to the site time, and time again. The market research needs to 
            establish answers to these questions and to provide on-constant monitoring 
            of the market-place in this regard.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="collaboration">Collaboration</a></h4>
          <p>At his paper presented at the First International Memory of the World 
            Conference in June 1996, Ray Edmondson, from the Australian National 
            Film and Sound Archive, proposed this approach to addressing the preservation 
            crisis facing audiovisual material the world over :</p>
          <blockquote>&quot;I believe coordinated action - national, regional 
            and global - is a strategic necessity if we are going to save the 
            audiovisual memory of the world. We haven’t always been good at this. 
            Now we must be. Much has been irretrievably lost; much more is on 
            the brink; trained and committed people are the foundation of development; 
            and we need the strategic and collective approach. Nitrate - and acetate 
            - won’t wait.&quot; </blockquote>
          <p>Although he was referring to audiovisual objects, Edmondson’s plea 
            for cooperation and collaboration at a national and international 
            level strikes at the heart of the way ahead for tackling the significant 
            issues raised in this paper. The online world has scant regard for 
            the physical world’s differentiation between libraries, museums, galleries 
            and archives, so those that can achieve effective collaboration between 
            institutions across the sectors and within each sector will have an 
            important competitive advantage over others. </p>
          <p>If we do not move efficiently and effectively to provide models and 
            pathways that help resolve the complex issues facing owners and custodians 
            of digital information, then we risk losing much of our respective 
            cultural heritage and of jeopardising the benefits that digitisation 
            and on-line digital archives promise. The resolve must be found to 
            ensure that neither of these scenarios comes to pass.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="digital">Digital technology</a></h4>
          <p>The digital technology of today provides us with new and powerful 
            means of preserving our cultural heritage and making it accessible 
            to all in a medium that is empowering, equitable and convenient. However, 
            the technological revolution in which museums are currently operating 
            presents several significant challenges to those institutions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the rapidity with which new and better technologies are emerging; 
            <li>the increasing rate of obsolescence of digital technologies used 
              to store and provide access to digital objects; and 
            <li>the proliferation of hardware and software solutions. 
          </ul>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="respond">Responding to the rapidity of technological 
            change</a></h4>
          <p>The rapid increase in power and functionality of digital technology 
            and of the computers in homes, schools and community centres through 
            which people will access digital archives creates the dilemma of when 
            to commit to purchasing and/or using new equipment. The promise of 
            things to come can debilitate the online program yet hasty decisions 
            can prove costly and more importantly may endanger the long-term preservation 
            of digital objects. Strategies are needed for anticipating new technologies 
            and estimating their likely impact on online programs and for evaluating 
            digital technologies that have been released to assess their suitability 
            and impact.</p>
          <p>A number of observers have called the World Wide Web an immature 
            technical environment. This suggests that at some point in the future 
            it will become &quot;mature&quot; with the attendant stability and 
            familiarity that that term implies. However, given the history of 
            technological change over the past fifteen years and the predictions 
            of even more rapid and far reaching changes into the foreseeable future, 
            the question arises: will the World Wide Web ever be &quot;mature&quot;? 
            Will it not always be in a state of flux, with great improvements 
            always around the corner? The challenge to management then is to manage 
            change.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="obsolete">Obsolescence of media and hardware</a></h4>
          <p>The issue of obsolescence may be seen to comprise of two main aspects:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>obsolescence of the media on which digital objects are stored; 
              and 
            <li>obsolescence of the hardware used to read the media on which data 
              is stored 
          </ul>
          <p>Digital data, as we understand it, does have a finite shelf-life. 
            The pits etched into a CD ROM that constitute data and the bits stored 
            magnetically on storage devices such as hard disks do deteriorate 
            over time. Yet, even if the bits remained forever on these or new 
            storage media it is highly unlikely that the hardware used to store 
            and read that media will itself have a life beyond five to seven years.<sup> 
            </sup> If the publicity is to be believed, certain new CD ROMs are 
            capable of retaining data stored on them for up to 200 years. The 
            question to ask is: will the technology used now to read these CD 
            ROMs be available in 10 years’ time, leave alone 200 years from now? 
            The transition from the 5.25 inch floppy diskette that were marvelled 
            at when first released to 3.5 inch mini-diskettes over the past five 
            years is perhaps a more stark reminder of how we misguidedly attribute 
            immortality to that which always seems exciting new technology. What 
            future the 3.5inch mini-diskette?</p>
          <p>Managing obsolescence requires a collaborative decision-making process 
            within museums that brings together managers, technicians and accountants 
            and which is mindful of best practice models, the potential for resource 
            sharing with other institutions, balancing cost with the obligation 
            to provide and maintain the means of access to digital information 
            (even though they might be obsolete in the public arena) and technological 
            developments either pending or which seem likely in the future. </p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="solutions">Proliferation of technological solutions</a></h4>
          <p>Managing the issues of obsolescence and migration is complicated 
            further by the sheer number of technology solutions that are in the 
            market-place today. Whilst the ever increasing array of possible technical 
            solutions constitutes a competitive market-place keeping prices down 
            and encouraging a service ethos, it does mean that institutions are 
            obliged to vet numerous solutions and solution providers. </p>
          <p>For those institutions investigating digital storage formats for 
            sound recordings there are about twelve viable solutions in the market 
            place. The number of scanners, digital cameras, compression cards, 
            CD ROM burners, browser plugins and utilities and other hardware and 
            software associated with online archives is increasing. In addition, 
            the number of companies offering solutions is increasing rapidly.</p>
          <p>Choosing the right hardware or software platform and solution provider 
            is a time-consuming and demanding task. It requires a: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>thorough needs analysis to define exactly what technical solution 
              is required; 
            <li>very sound understanding of technical issues and of the process 
              for which the solution is sought so costly and time-consuming pitfalls 
              might be avoided; and 
            <li>well articulated brief so that potential suppliers might understand 
              the institution’s needs and respond accordingly and so that effective 
              and meaningful contractual arrangements can be entered into. 
          </ul>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="resource">Resourcing an online program</a></h4>
          <p>Providing resources at appropriate levels presents a number of significant 
            challenges to collecting institutions. Each raises issues of what 
            constitutes an appropriate level; what is the most suitable training 
            program, equipment and software; how should the various products and 
            services be purchased and maintained; what is the time-frame for the 
            provision of these resources; and what amount of funds should be allocated 
            to the digitisation process.</p>
          <p>The successful balancing, on one hand, of resources against, on the 
            other, the institution’s charter and social responsibility requires 
            constant re-evaluation of the deployment of the former and a deep 
            understanding of, and commitment to, the latter.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="budget">Budgeting for the online world</a></h4>
          <p>Establishing budgets to undertake digitisation and digital object 
            preservation can be a complex and often unsatisfactory exercise for 
            museums and other collecting organisations. There are a number of 
            inter-related reasons for this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>digitisation is too new for there to be a sufficient number of 
              digitisation programs or sufficiently advanced strategies to provide 
              reliable cost models; 
            <li>data relevant to costings from online programs that have been 
              undertaken is not readily accessible nor has it necessarily been 
              recorded with view to providing cost models; 
            <li>general uncertainty as to what technology to acquire and under 
              what acquisition model (purchase, rent or lease?) in a market-place 
              in which new technologies and solutions are unveiled regularly and 
              where purchase prices reduce over time; 
            <li>general uncertainty as to the nature and quantity of personnel 
              and physical resources that are required or need to be redeployed 
              immediately and over time; and 
            <li>the unpredictability of the rate of obsolescence of hardware and 
              software and the resultant necessity for purchasing new equipment 
              and for the migration of data. 
          </ul>
          <p>In budgeting for digitisation programs, it would be prudent for institutions 
            to engage in a costings exercise involving a thorough identification 
            and costing of the physical and human resources required. The experience 
            of the Australian National Film and Sound Archives and of the Australian 
            Archives suggest that the most common cost items apart from the cost 
            of hardware and software, include: research and development, the process 
            of digitisation itself, and intellectual control, data transfer, storage 
            and delivery systems, as well as for the training of personnel and 
            the development of a range of appropriate management systems. Implied 
            in this list, yet deserving of particular mention, are the cost of 
            selection, cataloguing and indexing and migration of data. </p>
          <p>Of less obvious and immediate impact on the cost is the on-going 
            cost of maintenance, staff training and provision and maintenance 
            of electronic or personal &quot;help-desks&quot; in cases where the 
            public or other institutions have access to the digital archive. </p>
          <p>The complexity of establishing a budget is reflected in the somewhat 
            complex situation where most institutions that embark on a digitisation 
            strategy will need to undertake and maintain three parallel digitisation 
            programs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>digitisation of the collection as it existed pre-establishment 
              of the program 
            <li>digitisation of additions to the collection post-establishment 
              of the program 
            <li>preservation of digital objects - both those created via the digitisation 
              program and those that originated as digital objects 
          </ul>
          <p>These three programs will, of course, be running in parallel with 
            all other programs and day-to-day activities undertaken by the institution 
            and with which they will compete for the finite resources.</p>
          <h4><a href="#toc" name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h4>
          <p>This paper has argued that the World Wide Web is forcing a re-defining 
            of the role and business of museums. This re-defining is being brought 
            about by agents of change that emanate from the online world such 
            as: the increasingly sophisticated technology, finding and navigation 
            aids; consumer demand; and the widely acknowledged benefits that digitisation 
            offers to collection management and preservation of objects. </p>
          <p>Having established that the re-defining of museums is occurring, 
            the paper then outlines the nature of those changes - that is, how 
            the World Wide Web will impact on the way museums operate. The aspects 
            of museums that are being re-defined include: the very business in 
            which they are engaged; the way they perceive and respond to users, 
            their role as custodians of the national heritage and culture and 
            their relationship with other collecting institutions (convergence 
            as opposed to differentiation).</p>
          <p>Finally, in order to provide constructive and helpful advice on the 
            ways to manage change, the paper dealt with areas such as: management 
            training, how to resource online programs, collaborative methodologies, 
            budgeting and the imperative of market research.</p>
          <p>The rapid expansion of the World Wide Web into all sectors of business 
            and government and into our personal lives, together with the more 
            enabling and user-friendly technologies being developed mean that 
            museums that do not establish and implement an effective online strategy 
            will eventually be marginalised by both users and funding bodies.
