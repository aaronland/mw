          Docent programs have always presented an administrative challenge to 
          get the collection of skills, personalities, and individual schedules 
          to reliably cover program needs. How many of us have wished for a kind 
          of ideal interpreter, docent, or guide who, like the holographic doctor 
          in the latest Star Trek series, would always be on standby? In the true 
          sense of the word virtual, this helper would possess attributes and 
          capabilities not normally present in the same person. Are we dreaming 
          to look toward technology to fix for our volunteer predicament? <a href="#toc" name="tech">
          <h4>Appropriate Technology</h4>
          </a> Museums should take a look at the experiences of other organizations 
          facing similar problems. There are now business organizations with virtual 
          capabilities that never would have been thought to be possible a few 
          years ago (see William H. Davidow and Michael S.Malone, The Virtual 
          Corporation, New York, Harper Business, 1993). The key to their success 
          has been the application of computer technology to network capabilities 
          for a greater effect. Virtual organizations are not new and certainly 
          not dependant on computer technology to make themselves possible. It 
          seem as though virtual organizations need technological enhancements 
          to make their existence practical. Consider, for example, the practicality 
          any virtual organization operating without access to telephone technology. 
          The application of the virtual concept to docenting is not science fiction, 
          but a real possibility for extending the essence of docenting through 
          the practical use of web page technology. <a href="#toc" name="def">
          <h4>A Working Definition</h4>
          </a> Virtual docenting is the networked potential of all docent contributions. 
          Not many individuals have all the knowledge, skills and abilities to 
          docent effectively in a web environment. Virtual Docenting is the collaborative 
          interaction of the World Wide Web resized to work within your organization 
          and community. Internet connection is not necessarily required, because 
          the hypertext markup language, out of which web pages are constructed, 
          will work on local area networks, can be exchanged on floppy disks, 
          and can be used within the hard drives of shared individual computers. 
          HTML is modular, like Lego blocks, allowing many hands in the creation 
          of docent training materials, mentoring arrangements, and web-based 
          community outreach. Web page docenting transcends time and place limitations 
          that constrain participation of some docents. Finally, web technology 
          transports the docent's work into homes and schools that, at least, 
          have a PC running browser software. <a href="#toc" name="docent">
          <h4>Traditional Docenting in an Electronic Age</h4>
          </a> Traditional docenting has always possessed virtual qualities. Universities 
          welcomed these guest lecturers when no one on the faculty could provide 
          their particular expertise. Art museums could present more of their 
          collections with flexible docents than with just the curatorial staff. 
          Today the face to face interaction of docents is still preferred, but 
          is it still practical as museums move toward more technology? Are docents 
          needed in the electronic museum? What are the appropriate uses of the 
          museum/docent format when themes have little physical presence in the 
          hypertext world of the web? Can electronic docenting provide interactivity 
          in this new medium? These questions, certainly, require discussion among 
          museum education professionals and docent groups. The fact remains that 
          this environment, museums on the web, does need the guidance of trained 
          docents to navigate its connections and respond in a personalized way 
          to the questions of the visitor. <a href="#toc" name="learn">
          <h4>A Community of Learners</h4>
          </a> Since docents are a community of learners, then networking can 
          be used, potentially, to strengthen those bonds. In any form, docent 
          programs involve continuous learning and reconfiguring. Maintaining 
          a trained docent team demands administrative attention, even though 
          good programs can develop a life of their own in attracting and motivating 
          their membership. Personal computers have helped relieve some of the 
          administrative unruliness associated with scheduling contact time and 
          record keeping, but have not yet been used to network the collaborative 
          potential of docents. This is of critical importance as social trends 
          continue to dilute the ability of people to come together for common 
          purposes. The challenge is in getting our existing docent community 
          online and to start recruiting a new force of technologically savvy 
          docents from public at large. <a href="#toc" name="begin">
          <h4>Where to Begin</h4>
          </a> In nearly ever community there are technological initiatives happening 
          in the school systems. Classrooms are being networked and teachers are 
          being trained to use the world wide web. What is missing is enough suitable 
          content to flow through this educational network. It is natural for 
          the education community to turn to the museum community for help; after 
          all, we are in the business of creating meaningful content from our 
          collections. School districts are willing to commit classrooms and technological 
          resources to aid cultural organizations in creating new content for 
          the web. These students, trained in technology by their schools, are 
          good candidates for becoming virtual docents. They can be teamed with 
          experienced traditional docents in order that they may instruct each 
          other in how to best docent in the new medium of the web. <a href="#toc" name="summary">
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          </a> These examples show how technology can extend, rather than replace, 
          the interpersonal aspect that is basic to docenting. Docenting will 
          continue to be a hybrid of techniques and resources. At this time, there 
          are more questions than answers and much experimentation is needed. 
          At best, web technology can be used as leverage to increase the effectiveness 
          of our volunteer base and as a means of recruiting the skills and talents 
          need to take on the challenges to our institutions.
