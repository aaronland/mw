          <h3>Harvesting New Mexico's Cultural Resources</h3>
          <h4><a href="../../bios/traube.html">Alex 
            Traube</a>, Executive Director, New Mexico CultureNet, USA</h4>
          <font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">
          <p align="CENTER"><b>Introduction</b></p>
          </font><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" size=3>
          <p >This paper is about a museum's digitizing project. In a larger sense, 
            it is about telecommunications, and its potential to capture, shape, 
            and deliver cultural information and, in doing so, address a number 
            of social, educational, and economic needs of my state, New Mexico. 
            It is my contention that the time is right for grassroots, bottom-up 
            change in these areas.</p><b>
          <p >The Museum Project:</B> In 1997, The Palace of The Governors, New 
            Mexico's State History Museum, began working on a digitization pilot 
            project with two educational institutions in Santa Fe. Only a few 
            museum projects of this kind had been completed previously in New 
            Mexico, none involving the kind of partnership described here. The 
            partners in this project, along with the Palace, were the SER Academy, 
            an alternative Santa Fe high school for at-risk, predominantly Hispanic 
            youth, and Santa Fe Community College. </p>
          <p >The focus of this School-To-Work project, as it has become pegged, 
            is a brief but significant episode of the Civil War that took place 
            in New Mexico. Photographs, manuscripts, books, and artifacts associated 
            with the Civil War in New Mexico were photographed, digitized, and 
            catalogued by the teenage Academy students. The same students used 
            the digitized materials to create a Civil War In New Mexico web site. 
            The site will be available on publicly accessible computers at The 
            Palace of The Governors, in Santa Fe, and on the World Wide Web. </p>
          <p >The roles of the partners in the collaboration were pretty straightforward: 
            The Palace of The Governors provided physical materials (artifacts 
            and photographs), intellectual content (scholarly articles), career 
            mentoring from staff, and library resources where the students were 
            taught to do genealogical research. The Academy selected the student-workers 
            and provided daily instruction for them in various subjects, including 
            software and hardware-related skill development. The community college 
            contributed technological leadership, including a course in HTML for 
            the students; the college also provided a clearly delineated educational 
            path for the Academy students for after high school. It was my role 
            as project coordinator to bring the partners to the table, make sure 
            the agreements were clear, and oversee the completion of the project 
            within the framework of agreed upon goals.</p>

          <p align="CENTER">A PARTNERSHIP* MODEL FOR <br>
            EDUCATIONAL, CULTURAL, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</p>
          </font><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" size=3>
          <p >About ten months before this project began, the director of the 
            Palace of The Governors, Dr. Tom Chávez, asked me what would be a 
            reasonable starting point for his museum to consider the issues inherent 
            in digitizing its considerable collections. My answer was, start with 
            a small, narrowly focused pilot project that would both stimulate 
            public interest and create staff buy-in. Such a project, we understood, 
            would cause the beginning of a sea change for the museum, disrupting 
            people's routines, causing staff the discomfort of having to learn 
            new skills and ways of working, and perhaps most significantly, would 
            force staffers to act more collaboratively, compelling them to relinquish 
            some dominion over areas which had been theirs alone for years, even 
            decades. It should be noted that virtually all of the Palace of The 
            Governors staff is close to retirement age and are reluctant to learn 
            new ways of doing things at this point in their professional lives 
            Fortunately, Dr. Chávez is passionate about the changes which implementation 
            of technology at the museum will bring to scholarship and to education.</p>
          <p >Dr. Chávez and his colleagues decided that the Civil War represented 
            what was needed for a pilot project: a goodly amount (but not too 
            many) artifacts, photographs, maps, as well as original, in-house 
            scholarship. Two of the teachers at the Academy saw in this project 
            an opportunity to get funding via a Technology Literacy Grant from 
            the New Mexico State Department of Education. They were successful 
            and, within a fairly short period of time, we were able to begin planning 
            the project. So, a unique partnership formed between a museum, an 
            "alternative" high school, and a college. A picture of complementary 
            needs began to emerge. </p>

          <p >The Museum: </B></FONT><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" size=3>The 
            Palace of The Governors recognized that it needed to make more of 
            its collections accessible to the public and thus reach a wider audience. 
            After all, it is the state history museum, which in theory, means 
            that its purview is supposed to be <i>statewide</i>. Outreach, however, 
            is not easy in a sparsely populated, geographically large (fifth in 
            the union), poor state. New Mexico's culture, though widely celebrated, 
            is woefully underfunded. </p>
          <p >In addition to the clearly perceived imperative to extend the museum's 
            reach, the director understands that research ought to be integrated, 
            not discrete and determined by curatorial fiefdoms. Why shouldn't 
            one be able to search through photographs, books, maps, artifacts, 
            and paintings, all at the same time? A good question indeed.</p></FONT><b><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">
          <p >The High School:</B> </FONT><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" size=3>The 
            Academy, as the high school is called, uses computers extensively 
            for self-paced learning. In addition, the school staff see computers 
            as relating directly to the world of work. Programs like the one with 
            the Palace of The Governors tie in with a well funded but underutilized 
            School To Work initiative in the Santa Fe Public School District. 
            This project also was viewed as a grant magnet, something which proved 
            to be correct.</p>
          <p >Employment for young people, along with a 40+% high school drop 
            out rate (higher for Hispanics), is a major concern in Santa Fe. There 
            are few opportunities outside of state government (Santa Fe is the 
            state capital) or tourism-related service industries for employment. 
            There is a crying need for meaningful, sustained, professional level 
            jobs in Santa Fe, in all of New Mexico, really. Education and work-directed 
            training are essential requirements for improvement of this scenario.</p></FONT><b><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">
          <p >The Community College: </B></FONT><font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" size=3>Santa 
            Fe Community College was founded about ten years ago and immediately 
            became one of the cherished institutions of Santa Fe. The college 
            campus is pretty, modern, and clean; tuition is an incredible $17 
            a credit hour, with complete tuition waivers for any Santa Fe high 
            school graduate who wants to continue his or her education. Santa 
            Fe Community College is highly proactive to the poor and underserved 
            in a community which often only caters to the rich and well connected. 
          </p>
          <p >In addition to providing post secondary and lifelong educational 
            opportunities to the people of this community, SFCC is a designated 
            New Media Center, one of only 400 such sites worldwide. This designation 
            means that the college has an obligation to use technology in the 
            service of cultural preservation.</p></FONT>

          <p >There is a wealth of cultural resources in New Mexico waiting to 
            be <i>harvested </i>and <i>processed</i>. Museum, archival, library, 
            and individual collections need to be translated into electronic forms 
            which people can access, independent of location- in their homes, 
            classrooms, and other public facilities. To cite one example of an 
            underutilized, almost inaccessible collection, the Palace of The Governors 
            has the best collection of historical photographs in the United States, 
            west of the Mississippi. Its Photographic Archives contains over 530,000 
            images, which are not even in a database, let alone digitized. </p>
          <p >Other examples of material awaiting digitization and electronic 
            publication are: Indian languages which are oral only, manuscripts 
            which are too fragile to be handled, sites too remote for most people 
            to get to (<i>e.g.,</i> El Morro State Park, the site of the Inscription 
            Rock, with the carved names of early Spanish settlers to New Mexico), 
            murals, buildings, furniture, and writing done by WPA writers, etc.,

          <p >Am I being naive or is there a gigantic opportunity inherent in 
            the Information Age in New Mexico? Why is no one in our state talking 
            about INFORMATION as a generator of economic growth? We have the raw 
            materials. Shouldn't we be able to create jobs with the generations-long 
            tasks which lie ahead of us? Are we not at the beginning of a long, 
            long process of using technology in service of building "Cultural 
            Pyramids," new information structures? We contend that these new information 
            structures can turn the economy of New Mexico around.</p>
          <p >The huge quantity of materials that need to be digitally captured 
            (via still cameras, scanners, video cameras, tape recorders, etc.), 
            shaped (into databases, web sites, curricula, etc.), and published 
            (on the web, over public access television, on radio, on videotape, 
            and, even, on paper) present us with critically needed opportunities 
            to train young people for meaningful work and, in doing so, make the 
            process our own. <i>We need to own the process!</p></I>

          <p >Without<b> </b>rigorous education and training, all the meaningful 
            jobs in the world don't mean a thing for citizens of New Mexico. These 
            jobs will go to transplants from California or Chicago. This would 
            be yet another form of colonization that we can't afford. We need 
            to look at the Information Age in New Mexico as the mechanism to foster 
            education, ethnic knowledge and pride, career training, cultural preservation, 
            and equalized access to publicly owned information. Commitment to 
            education is the key to capitalizing on the opportunities presented 
            by technology's capability to deliver information and images of our 
            culture to people who need them the most. </p>

          <p >New Mexico is more than a destination point or a style. It is a 
            cultural confluence, a counterpoint to the history of the United States 
            as it is told in most history books. We need to tell our own history 
            and add it to the fabric of our nation's identity. If we do not, we 
            face the real possibility that, once again, others will come to New 
            Mexico and will do the job for us-at a cost. They will claim to be 
            respectful and objective, but they will not know how to be so. They 
            will mainly know how to profit from our heritage, our patrimony. </p>
          <p >There is the real possibility that no new jobs will be created,

            <li>New Mexico CultureNet reflects the need of people in New Mexico 
              to have increased and equal access to cultural information. Much 
              of the information in museums, libraries, archives, and universities 
              has been funded by taxpayer dollars; those same taxpayers, we feel, 
              should have greater access than they now do. </li></P>
            <p >
            <li>New Mexico CultureNet reflects the need for young people to participate 
              in their community's cultural life, not only as visitors, but an 
              salaried employees. Current staff are approaching retirement age, 
              this as audiences are becoming overwhelmingly gray. </li></P>
            <p >
            <li>New Mexico CultureNet reflects the need to create economic development 
              and employment opportunities in New Mexico, particularly for youth. 
              We see culture as the great untapped, clean resource which can drive 
              economic development, create jobs, and allow people to remain in 
              rural communities. </li></P>
            <p >
            <li>New Mexico CultureNet reflects the need to integrate the arts 
              up and down and across the curriculum in education. We provide resources 
              which can be easily found and used by people of all ages, including 
              teachers and students. </li></P>
            <p >
            <li>New Mexico CultureNet reflects the need to encourage participation 
              in and enjoyment of the arts. Clear data exist which demonstrate 
              that technology training alone is not enough to produce workers 
              capable of handling the demands of jobs in this Information Age. 
              We must train the imaginative, the articulate, and the collaborative 
              sides of people's brains in order for them succeed in this New World. 
            </li></P>
            <p >
            <li>New Mexico CultureNet reflects the need to learn more about the 
              cultures and history of New Mexico in order to cultivate pride, 
              understanding, and tolerance. We are at risk of becoming peoples 
              without culture, without a sense of who we are, but filled with 
              prejudices built on ignorance. Our strategy is to create information 
              resources which are objective and multicultural.</li></P>

            <p >While the following observations may not seem to directly relate

            <li>Slowness: Dealing with bureaucracies can sometimes be maddening; 
              dealing with schools is worse.</li></P>
            <p >
            <li>Cooperation: Educators, bureaucrats, museum professionals all 
              can be like hens guarding their nests. Refocusing agreed upon goals 
              and objectives at regular intervals is imperative.</li></P>
            <p >
            <li>Funding: One has to be crystal clear about who gets how much for 
              what.</li></P>
            <p >
            <li>Independence vs. Interdependence: The current wisdom is, collaborate 
              or die! Make sure that each and every partner gets and receives; 
              win/win is critical to successful partnerships. </li></P>
            <p >
            <li>What Is Needed vs. What is Wanted: Someone said at a meeting last 
              summer, "Anyone can give a client what they need; the trick is to 
              give them what they want." We need to remember this daily, particularly 
              in the education and cultural communities. Of course, the real trick 
              is to get people to want what they need.</li></P>
            <p >
            <li>Who Really Does the Work: Map out tasks as much as possible, the 
              clearer the better. </li></P>
            <p >
            <li>Scalability: Make sure you can reuse your project on a larger 
              scale. Also make sure you can hand off the collaboration as a model 
              to other similar organizations; this is what the TIIAP folks call 
              interoperability. </li></P>
