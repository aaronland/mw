              Community and Continuity for the Museum Visitor</h3>
            <h4><a href="../../bios/friedlander.html">Larry 
              Friedlander</a>, Stanford University</h4>
            Research projects underway at Stanford on improving learning in higher 
            education have implications for museum planning and for the use of 
            the web. The Stanford Learning Lab is exploring a set of new tools 
            and procedures to make learning more effective by granting the individual 
            learner personalized attention even within the scope of large lecture 
            classes, and by developing ways to record and access learning experiences 
            over the course of a student's entire career. This work has important 
            implications for the museum world: 
            <ul>
              <li>web sites can be used to foster communication and discussion 
                between members of the public, as well as between museum professionals 
                and individual visitors
                <p> 
              <li>visitors can form special interest groups and organize activities 
                and projects on their own that connect to the museum
                <p> 
              <li>web sites can be used to collect information about the public, 
                and to respond to special needs and questions
                <p> 
              <li>museums can begin to track the visitor's relationship to the 
                museum over time, and to help the visitor record and re-use museum 
                experiences
                <p> 
              <li>visitors can create portfolios of museum materials, together 
                with notes, commentary, and personal reflections
                <p> 
              <li>museums can form special relationships with members or specific 
                groups, providing these groups with personalized information such 
                as videos and annotated texts, announcements, and marketing offers 
            </ul>

          <td width="450"> These uses of the web are supported by new kinds of 
            learning spaces that integrate virtual and 'real' activities, and 
            allow the smooth integration of individual and group instruction. 
            Such Learning Studios can be created within the museum to maximize 
            the use of web materials and instruction, and to create a flexible 
            environment for museum educational activities.
            <p> I will now describe the Stanford Learning lab and its major efforts 
              in these areas.
            <p> 
            <h4>STANFORD UNIVERSITY LEARNING LAB</h4>
            The Learning Lab was established in 1997 by President Casper and the 
            Commission on Technology in Teaching and Learning. It is the centerpiece 
            of Stanford's response to the revolutionary changes now facing education. 
            Its aim is to achieve a substantial impact on the quality of education 
            at Stanford and elsewhere through the use of innovative technology 
            and pedagogy.
            <p> The Lab sponsors research in learning itself and the technologies 
              and curricular structures that best support that learning. In particular, 
              the Lab focuses on the judicious application of pedagogically informed 
              learning technology, closely analyzing the interactions between 
              pedagogy and technology in learning and avoiding any simplistic 
              reliance on technical innovation for its own sake.. Situated outside 
              any discipline and departmental boundaries, the SLL serves as a 
              strategic center and advisor for the university as a whole, testing 
              educational options in order to inform, guide, and give early warning 
              to those in the university who must respond to the changing educational 
              environment. The SLL focuses on how learning actually happens at 
              Stanford.
            <p> The Learning Lab's most notable characteristic is its emphasis 
              on the deep assessment of real learning (and associated teaching) 
              activity together with the formal assessment of the impact of technology. 
              So the Lab will develop stringent and comprehensive assessment protocols 
              to accurately determine the effectiveness any new strategies and 
              to ensure that its successful experiments can be repeated and expanded
            <p> 
            <h4>MAKING COMMUNITIES OUT OF AN ANONYMOUS PUBLIC</h4>
            Stanford is now engaging on a concerted effort to re-think its undergraduate 
            education programs in order to provide students with personalized, 
            intimate, and engaged learning. Accordingly, the first project of 
            the Learning Lab this Fall Quarter was the redesign and testing of 
            a new Stanford freshman course, Introduction to the Humanities: The 
            Word and the World. This project is the first in a series of studies 
            to be conducted by the Lab which will focus on large lecture courses. 
            The heart of the experiment was the development of an array of Internet 
            tools designed to support a radical restructuring of the course's 
            pedagogy.
            <p> Freshman here at Stanford, and elsewhere for that matter, typically 
              spend much of their time in courses that combine lectures to large 
              audiences with small discussion groups taught by junior instructors 
              or advanced students, a format that poses important motivational 
              and curricular problems. The scale of the class makes coordination 
              of discussions and lectures difficult and discourages communication 
              and collaboration among students and faculty. The result is often 
              an apathetic and alienated student group.
            <p> The Intro. to Hum class is one of the first versions of a new 
              format for a required Freshman course designed to replace the current 
              Culture Values and Civilization series. The course, with ninety 
              students, is team-taught by three faculty from diverse disciplines 
              and two instructors who lead the discussion sections. The curriculum 
              stresses close attention to a few selected and exemplary texts approached 
              from of variety of view-points: i.e. history, literature, and philosophy. 
              Thus the course emphasizes methods of reading, rather than content. 
              By 1999 all entering freshman will take some version of this new 
              course.
            <p> The Lab has designed a new kind of lecture course, one that retains 
              the basic format of lecture and discussion but that transforms the 
              passive student body into an active community of engaged participants. 
              This transformation is achieved through a mix of new curricular 
              formats and innovative applications of web-based technologies. Innovations 
              include cross-section group projects; web-based, dynamic, and on-going 
              assessment and feedback systems; and computer-mediated discussions 
              among faculty and students. The technology has been carefully designed 
              to merge with and support the new forms of teaching and curricular 
              organization. 
            <p> For example, in this course all works are studied twice--the first 
              time the focus is on discussion within discrete sections of the 
              individual works; the second time students engage in a series of 
              examinations of groups of the texts and form on their own cross-sectional 
              collaborations and projects. Students are invited to structure the 
              second half of the course, taking part in lectures and defining 
              areas of debate and analysis.
            <p> The lab has developed a series of web-based tools and formats 
              for the course which: 
            <ul>
              <li>Presents the resources, tutorials and assignments for the course, 
                allowing personalized study,
                <p> 
              <li>Collects, distributes, archives and displays all student work,
                <p> 
              <li>Supports intra- and inter-sectional on-line discussion,
                <p> 
              <li>Alerts and announces course events,
                <p> 
              <li>Displays collaborative notebooks for use by student groups doing 
                projects,
                <p> 
              <li>Collects and organizes each student's work 
            </ul>
            In addition, the project employs an extensive range of modes of assessment: 
            questionnaires, interviews, video interaction analysis, peer review, 
            and ethnographic studies.
            <p> This web-based, cross-platform system supports close interactions 
              and feedback among faculty and students as they carry out projects, 
              assignments and discussions. It accommodates sharing of documents 
              within and across working groups; delivery of alerts, schedules 
              and announcements; asynchronous and synchronous peer-to-peer and 
              novice-expert discussion, planning and argumentation; development 
              of collaborative notebooks and project records; peer critique and 
              publication of student experiments in "Course Journals," archiving 
              of student work, and data collection with tools that record and 
              help to analyze student activities. This system also maintains an 
              archive of previous students' work allowing new students to draw 
              on the experiences of earlier learners in planning experiments and 
              projects. Finally, the system facilitates coordination and assessment 
              of individual, small group, project, section, and large group course 
              activities. Instructors will be able to capture, critique, and document 
              activities and personal work on an ongoing basis, and these data 
              will provide us with the means for a comprehensive assessment program 
              and for ongoing, formative evaluation.
            <p> In summary, the potential tools useful to museums would be: 
            <ul>
              <li><em>Forums</em>: To support asynchronous on-line discussion. 
                The system displays images of the discussant, provides multiple 
                layers of organizational categories, indexes messages in a summary 
                view, and makes reading easier by visually organizing the screen 
                for comprehensibility.
                <p> 
              <li><em>Alerting and Announcement System</em>: Used to post messages 
                to members of selected groups or all the public visitors. It allows 
                the museum to select from active (e-mail based) and/or passive 
                (web-based) distribution.
                <p> 
              <li><em>Assignment Distribution and Submission Systems</em>: Allows 
                museum to develop on-line educational activities that can automatically 
                collect and route public response and work. Such work can be done 
                directly on the Web, or using other applications such as word 
                processors, CAD, or drawing programs.
                <p> 
              <li><em>Work Collections</em>: public to view and review their own 
                and other visitor's contributions that have been collected along 
                with comments from the museum staff. The collection can include 
                both formal and informal postings. Collections can be used for 
                knowledge sharing among learners, reflection upon one's previous 
                contributions and assessment by museum staff.
                <p> 
              <li><em>Authentication System</em>: Used to password the course 
                site so that private and fair use information can be included 
                on web pages. 
            </ul>
            <h4>E-FOLIOS</h4>
            E-folios are personalized knowledge bases that support the learning 
            process by facilitating: 
            <ul>
              <li>the reuse, reflection, integration (synthesis) and sharing of 
                knowledge;
                <p> 
              <li>the development of life-long learning skills and attitudes.
                <p> 
            </ul>
            E-folios are used by: 
            <ul>
              <li>individual learners to capture, organize, integrate and reuse 
                the results of formal and informal learning experiences;
                <p> 
              <li>educators to assess students and share teaching resources in 
                order to provide students with guidance and rich learning opportunities 
                within appropriate and innovative pedagogical frameworks;
                <p> 
              <li>learning communities to share and manage information and to 
                facilitate distributed, collaborative and cost-effective learning. 
            </ul>
            The Stanford University Learning Laboratory Electronic Learning Portfolios 
            (E-folios) project will research and develop such methods and technologies, 
            and work towards integrating them into the learning experience of 
            Stanford students, faculty, staff alumni, and partner industry professionals.
            <p> The Electronic Learning Portfolios (E-folios) is intended to help 
              individuals capture, organize, integrate and re-use the results 
              of learning experiences encountered throughout their careers. E-folios 
              can contribute significantly to improvements in personalized, collaborative 
              learning while also supporting a variety of student learning styles.
            <p> E-folios are ubiquitous, portable electronic knowledge bases that 
              are private, personalized and sharable. They contain and represent 
              one's own formal and informal learning experience At the same time, 
              E-folio content can be selectively shared, thereby creating an unlimited 
              constellation of larger communities with common understandings and 
              experience. Such communities can range in scale from pair relationships 
              to teams of several persons through to enterprise-wide frameworks.

            <h4>NEW SPACES FOR LEARNING AND FOR ACTIVITIES</h4>
            Stanford University is creating a new high technology classroom/laboratory 
            known as <strong>The Learning Space</strong>. This facility will be 
            used as a testing place for undergraduate curricula and teaching method 
            In its capacity as a teaching facility, <strong>The Learning Space</strong> 
            will allow for completely flexible teaching and learning arrangements, 
            with full connectivity for each student, new forms of projection, 
            visualization, and collaborative creation and virtual experimentation.
            <p> In its capacity as a laboratory for innovative curricular design, 
              it will serve as a workshop for faculty to devise and test new teaching 
              strategies, new digital applications and experiments, and new forms 
              of student initiated research. 
            <p> <strong>The Learning Space</strong> departs from traditional classroom 
              design by allowing the learner and instructor to configure the facility 
              for the activity, the research goals and the special needs of individual 
              learners. Its design flows from the Stanford Learning Lab's conviction 
              that students' understanding and appreciation of the arts, science, 
              and technology is greatly enhanced in environments which: 
            <ul>
              <li>Allow students to 'own' or personalize individual and groups 
                spaces.
                <p> 
              <li>Support hands-on educational experiences. These experiences 
                include running experiments, dissecting physical artifacts, creating 
                design solutions, collaborating over the Internet, giving formal 
                presentations, and the direct manipulation of physical artifacts.
                <p> 
              <li>Support a variety of learning activities from lecture/discussion, 
                to group design work and collaboration learning models, to lab 
                experiments. It will allow for easy transition from small-group 
                to large-group activities, even within a single class period.
                <p> 
              <li>Combine formal education with informal and spontaneous learning 
                in a communal setting.
                <p> 
              <li>Support the presentation and collection of students' work and 
                concepts in a gallery-like atmosphere. We see educational value 
                in students displaying and reviewing the work of others.
                <p> 
            </ul>
            <strong>The Learning Space</strong> will be an open lab/studio/seminar 
            facility that can be configured to support and study different types 
            of learning activities. It is conceived as a flexible space in which 
            all components can be reconfigured to support specific tasks. It will 
            accommodate eight to ten small working groups as well as provide a 
            setting for formal presentations. Some features of the room include: 
            <ul>
              <li>Lightweight, moveable furniture that allows the space to be 
                easily reconfigured from a seminar table, to a to a design-planning-brainstorming 
                area, to lab benches. In the lab bench configuration there will 
                be access to tools, physical resource materials, a white board, 
                and a storage locker. It is critical that the set-up time of the 
                physical space to move students from small group work to formal 
                presentations be minimal.
                <p> 
              <li>Systems for displaying student work and physical /virtual artifacts. 
                This will be accomplished with many large white boards, bulletin 
                boards, cabinets, and several bright, large-screen projection 
                systems showing computer and video displays on several walls. 
                The projectors will show student work, re-present past learning 
                activities, and visually configure the room for special tasks.
                <p> 
              <li>Ubiquitous, high-speed networking: computers can be connected 
                to the network from anywhere in the room.
                <p> 
              <li>Computers artfully inserted in the environment so they do not 
                inhibit discussion; for example, imbedded screens in special furniture 
                and lab equipment. 
            </ul>
            Video cameras and microphones set up to record course activities. 
            The room will be instrumented for use by students in documenting their 
            own work and for use by the teaching and coaching staff in reviewing 
            and studying --- for example, group dynamics and exercise effectiveness.

            <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
            Museums can begin to create long term personal relationships with 
            visitors through the Web, and to integrate web based materials in 
            the museum space through the creation of flexible and multi purposed 
            learning spaces.
