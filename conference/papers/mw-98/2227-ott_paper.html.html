          <h3>DEVELOPING A VOLUNTEER BASED PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION USING THE 
            INTERNET</h3>
          <h4><a href="../../bios/ott.html">Andrea 
            Ott</a>, Computer Advisory Coordinator, Ontario Museum Association, 
            Canada</h4>
          <p>&#9;Most cultural organizations have been built on a structure of 
            volunteers. With the advent of the Internet, there is a new medium 
            to explore and expand services in museums and related institutions. 
            I will illustrate new methods of extending services in volunteer based 
            cultural organizations using the example of the Ontario Museum Association 
            and several museums and related institutions in Ontario<sup><a href="#foot1" name="foot1back" target="_self">1</a></sup>. 
            In addition I will also address electronic volunteerism in the museum 
            profession. This paper is not so much about volunteers volunteering 
            electronically, although this subject will be addressed, as setting 
            up an appropriate environment to attract audiences to and service 
            a volunteer based organization using the Internet.</p>
          <p>&#9;In this paper, I will use the following definition of volunteer 
            activity: "anything done, made, given of one's own free will." In 
            the case of museums, the definition is meant to mean to service the 
            existence of the institution and its services to the public. In the 
            context of a professional association, like the Ontario Museum Association, 
            the meaning is often extended to providing service of one's own free 
            will for the advancement of the museum profession and assistance to 
            the museum professional in servicing the existence of a cultural institution 
            and the public. This paper will refer to both sectors.</p>
          <h3>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION FORUMS</h3>
          <p>&#9;Museums and related institutions can provide services to their 
            audiences by simply providing the forum for communication and discussion. 
            Forums may include not only listservs but also e-mail publications, 
            electronic conferencing using products such as FirstClass<sup>TM</sup> 
            software as used and described at the <a href="../http://www.ffa.ucalgary.ca/" target="_top">CultureNet 
            web site</a>, video conferencing<sup><a href="#foot2" name="foot2back" target="_self">2</a></sup>, 
            a web site such as the Forum section of the <a href="../http://www.chin.gc.ca/" target="_top">Canadian 
            Heritage Information Network web site</a> and in the proper context 
            chat lines. Listservs thus far have been the predominate mode of electronic 
            discussion but as the technology and societal literacy expands the 
            use of some other methods will likely grow.</p>
          <p>&#9;At the Ontario Museum Association, we have set-up a listserv 
            "onmuse-l" where individuals can share information of interest with 
            museum professionals, students and others concerned with art, heritage 
            and culture in Ontario, and "Trillium", an institutional membership 
            based electronic network. By simply offering a medium we are encouraging 
            volunteerism by colleagues sharing information in the community. Often, 
            the information is professional such as conservators responding to 
            conservation issues. In addition, we publish an electronic publication 
            to members of Trillium. <i>Trillium News</i> provides timely information 
            on advocacy issues, professional development opportunities, technological 
            information and current job postings.</p>
          <p>&#9;Few will disagree that the Internet has in itself been built 
            on sharing information or should we say "volunteering" our time and 
            expertise to help other cyberspace users. This practice is most evident 
            in the listserv. It is an understood practice to contribute information 
            you are aware of for the mutual benefit of all on a listserv. In exchange, 
            when you have a question or problem, others will respond often saving 
            you a great deal of time and potentially money. In addition, active 
            participation is a wonderful method of professional development. Solid 
            professional reputations in one's area of expertise have been built 
            on listerv discussions and one can gather much valuable information 
            and contacts. Increasingly, participating on listservs is being considered 
            more and more part of our jobs and recognized as such by our employers. 
            Indeed, it is part of our profession to assist our colleagues and 
            the public as well as stay abreast of issues in our fields of expertise. 
            The medium of the listserv only makes such participation much more 
            individual driven in that we choose to participate rather than have 
            someone come to us personally for information.</p>

          <h3>EXTENDING EXISTING COMMUNICATIONS ON THE INTERNET </h3>
          <p>&#9;Most museums begin their World Wide Web site by placing information 
            on their services, location, membership benefits, hours of operation 
            and programs. In addition, most sites contain links to other sites 
            of interest to the visitor. Many museums can develop such a website 
            in a relatively easy manner thereby attracting the larger world to 
            their institutions. These are relatively simple processes in the sense 
            that the information is already there. However, museums and related 
            institutions may also place other information not so common on the 
            Internet that would be of benefit to their audiences thereby increasing 
            their virtual visitation.</p>
          <p>&#9;The <a href="../http://www.museumassn.on.ca/" target="_top">Ontario 
            Museum Association</a> is a service organization for the members and 
            the public. Membership and Public information has been included on 
            its site. In addition, the OMA has mounted a guide of Ontario museums 
            of over 500 institutions. This service was completed with relative 
            ease. A database of institutions was initially produced to publish 
            a <i>Guide of Ontario Museums</i>. With simple programming to HTML 
            we were able to mount the site and thereby service a world-wide audience 
            attracting larger audiences to our services and the services of our 
            members. The electronic guide is the major current attraction to our 
            web site.</p>
          <p>&#9;In addition, the Ontario Museum Association will be investigating 
            mounting other existing services on the Internet. An electronic journal 
            to supplement our existing newsletter <i>Currently</i> is being investigated. 
            Our popular job posting services will also be investigated for placement 
            on-line possibly only password accessible for members. Some registration 
            and order forms are already on-line with the possibility of expanding 
            to electronic cash. As more and more museums obtain e-mail accounts, 
            we are developing an e-mail network of all museums in the province 
            for advocacy and information dissemination purposes to feasibly reach 
            all museums very quickly without the long distance charges that a 
            similar fax network incurs.</p>
          <p>&#9;Many museums are also extending existing information on-line. 
            Museums are increasingly using e-mail address lists to market their 
            programs and more and more museums are requesting e-mail addresses 
            from members and other contacts for this purpose. Creative projects 
            like this use limited resources for development since they exist elsewhere 
            in the institution but can have a large impact on the efficiency of 
            the institution. Museums are also exploring placing volunteer registration 
            forms on-line and related volunteer information on-line such as the 
            <a href="../http://www.burlingtonartcentre.on.ca/" target="_top">Burlington 
            Art Centre</a>. The <a href="../http://www.tomthomson.org/" target="_top">Tom 
            Thomson Memorial Art Gallery</a> has placed gift shop items on-line.</p>
          <h3>WWW SITE SPECIFIC PROJECTS</h3>
          <p>&#9;Of course, an institution's WWW site is a basis for developing 
            and servicing a volunteer base, providing services to the public and 
            attracting audiences to the institution. Rather than only placing 
            existing institutional information on-line, museums and related institutions 
            are experimenting with specific projects specifically designed for 
            the web. </p>
          <p>&#9;The Ontario Museum Association has completed two such projects 
            to date. We collected information to compile a listing of traveling 
            exhibitions available for loan and a listing of collections management 
            vendors. The traditional method would have been to publish this information 
            but the cost of printing and distributing this information made it 
            more attractive to publish on-line for the benefit of our constituency. 
            We hope to extend and offer other services such as this. In addition, 
            the Ontario Museum Association will be exploring the development of 
            its site with a public forum on museum topics, a public relations 
            section on the benefit of museums to the community and the importance 
            of volunteerism. It is hoped that by servicing our constituency through 
            the web site that new audiences will be attracted to the organization 
            and the public will have an increased appreciation of museums.</p>
          <p>&#9;Many museums have been completing similar projects on the World 
            Wide Web. The most concrete and often cited example is virtual exhibits, 
            on-line exhibits with images and text. The <a href="../http://www.diabetes.ca/atoz/banting/banting.htm" target="_top">Banting 
            Museum</a>, <a href="../http://www.tomthomson.org/" target="_top">Tom 
            Thomson Memorial Art Gallery</a> and <a href="../http://www.mztv.com/mztv/" target="_top">MZTV 
            Museum of Television</a> all have virtual exhibits on-line. Archives 
            are placing archival information on-line such as the <a href="../http://www.kawartha.net/~jleonard/home.htm" target="_top">Peterborough 
            Centennial Museum and Archives</a>. Some institutions have also placed 
            an archives of past exhibitions on-line complete with images such 
            as <a href="../http://www.interlog.com/~mercer" target="_top">Mercer 
            Union</a>. There are now two types of visitors that some museums are 
            conducting audience development reports on: the physical visitor to 
            our institution and the virtual visitor to on-line exhibitions. </p>
          <p>&#9;The Internet is a new medium of communication and as such is 
            a medium that has products that are conducive to it alone. Projects 
            can sometimes be delivered more cost effectively on-line as well as 
            reach audiences otherwise inaccessible. The point of these type of 
            projects is to service members and volunteers; attract new audiences 
            to the institution; save the institutions time with telephone calls, 
            mail, faxes and e-mail; and public relations and awareness building. 
          </p>
          <h3>EDUCATION SERVICES</h3>
          <p>&#9;Statistics indicate that continuous learning is a facet of the 
            new marketplace and technology based training (TBT) will increase 
            31.3% by the year 2000<sup><a href="#foot3" name="foot3back" target="_self">3</a></sup>. 
            Technology based training is the discipline of designing systems for 
            support of workers in training, which ranges from simple audio tapes 
            to highly sophisticated simulations employing virtual reality. The 
            advantages are long range cost efficiency, ability to reach large 
            geographical areas, reduced learning time and better student performance<sup><a href="#foot4" name="foot4back" target="_self">4</a></sup>. 
            Museums and related institutions have an opportunity to take advantage 
            of these important trends.</p>
          <p>&#9;The Ontario Museum Association embarked on its first attempt 
            on providing distance learning on the Internet in partnership with 
            the University of Western Ontario, November 3 to December 12, 1997. 
            Twenty-five individuals participated in a six week on-line course 
            entitled "World Wide Web Page Design for the Museum Professional" 
            using the Web and a listserv. The self-directed course provided the 
            basics of web page creation and design in a museum context. The intent 
            of the course was to have each participant finish the course with 
            a web site, critiqued by colleagues, the instructor and a on-line 
            volunteer committee of museum advisors. Advertising for the course 
            included using listservs which enabled us to attract two participants 
            from outside Ontario and one participant from the United States. The 
            subject matter of this course was well suited to this endeavour and 
            to reaching the Association's membership base which is dispersed over 
            a large geographical area.</p>
          <p>&#9; The Ontario Museum Association will be investigating other methods 
            of offering distance education services. The Association offers a 
            Certificate in Museum Studies consisting of nine courses, one distance 
            education in partnership with Laurentian University using a resource 
            binder and e-mail and telephone communication, and eight courses of 
            three days each offered in museums across the province and taught 
            by professionals in the field of the subject. We will be investigating 
            assisting this Certificate on-line with registrations, reading lists 
            and important WWW site links. Video conferencing, electronic conferencing, 
            website development and listservs will also be investigated for special 
            seminars and courses. It is hoped that we will open other methods 
            of communication throughout the Association's core activities thereby 
            opening the Association to a wider audience and more efficiently servicing 
            our existing members. </p>
          <p>&#9;Museums in general are beginning to offer information about their 
            education services on the Web such as program descriptions with registration 
            forms as in the example of the <a href="../http://www.burlingtonartcentre.on.ca/" target="_top">Burlington 
            Art Centre</a>. <a href="../http://www.torontohistory.on.ca/" target="_top">Heritage 
            Toronto</a> has placed ideas for teachers for school programs and 
            a Toronto History Quiz on-line. This is the beginning of educating 
            via a web site which also increases the interactivity and resource 
            value of the site.</p>
          <h3>SPONSORSHIPS, DONATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS</h3>
          <p>&#9;As with any medium of communication, the Internet offers the 
            potential for sponsorships, donations and partnerships. Many web sites 
            now have sponsorships for their sites. Often placing the sponsor logo 
            on the web site is part of a larger project such as sponsorship of 
            a museum exhibition. Having a web site which attracts a wider audience 
            increases the appeal of the sponsor. Of course the key with sponsorships 
            is to have attractive features in the sites that also attract large 
            audiences. </p>
          <p>&#9;Many museums have received donations of services for the building 
            of their web sites. Areas of donation include e-mail accounts, server 
            space, web site design and maintenance. Museums are attractive for 
            this type of donation for local Internet service providers as museums 
            tend to naturally attract local audiences for community services and 
            events. The Ontario Museum Association encourages its members to obtain 
            a domain registration, ensure that they do not sign into expensive 
            maintenance contracts, and for small and mid-sized museums have volunteer 
            or staff expertise to update a site. The development of a web site 
            is an excellent area to solicit volunteer assistance, particularly 
            from the younger generation often familiar with the new technologies. 
            The <a href="../http://www.interlog.com/~gwhite/ttt/mtmainpg.html" target="_top">Museum 
            for Textiles web site</a> is an example of a site completed entirely 
            be a volunteer. In addition, there are many internships, co-op, summer 
            and other employment programs that are very conducive to the development 
            of a museum's web site.</p>
          <p>&#9;Partnerships tend to refer to working with colleagues in offering 
            services. The Ontario Museum Association offered a free seminar in 
            association with BGM, a Canadian company that completes digitization 
            and multimedia projects as well as photographic image services to 
            a broad range of clients. BGM already offers free general seminars 
            to the public on digitization, prepress and image processes, and were 
            very willing to produce a specialized workshop when given the needs 
            of the museum community. Our members had the opportunity to learn 
            about the new technologies at no fee while BGM could market to the 
            museum community. The participants of the workshop met after the workshop 
            to discuss their perceptions of the workshop and share methods for 
            implementing the new technologies in their institutions. An on-going 
            partnership has been developed with the Canadian Heritage Information 
            Network to assist Ontario museums with Internet connections and training. 
            As well, CHIN hosted the listservs on its server that the Ontario 
            Museum Association has set-up. The Ontario Museum Association is networking 
            with colleagues, the public and private sectors in delivering services 
            to its constituency. The intent is not to duplicate resources that 
            already exist in the community but to assist colleagues and other 
            partners in servicing member and public needs in the most mutually 
            beneficial manner.</p>
          <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
          <p>&#9;I started out this paper speaking of electronic volunteers. So 
            far I have discussed transforming a volunteer based organization onto 
            the Internet. As with any medium of museum operation, there are volunteers 
            servicing that medium. In an electronic environment there will increasingly 
            be volunteers that volunteer electronically be it through electronic 
            communications, development of web sites and on-line education programs, 
            and donation of services and money. The most common area of volunteering 
            is via the development of a web site and many institutions have benefited 
            by such volunteers be it through donation of money or services, sponsorship 
            or partnerships. There are institutions that exist entirely by volunteer 
            services where all services including the Internet is completed by 
            volunteers. This paper also discussed electronic communications and 
            how on a listserv we as professionals may be perceived to volunteer 
            electronically. As with all volunteering, doing so can benefit a career 
            substantially. By providing volunteers with a network of communication 
            such as listservs and Internet connections, organizations can conduct 
            its business including volunteer activity more efficiently.</p>
          <p>&#9;To recap, volunteer based service organizations can transform 
            their services to members and the public substantially with the use 
            of the Internet. Some of the key methods are:</p>
          <p>&#9;• offer forums of communication to the membership and public 
            using listservs, electronic newsletters, electronic conferencing, 
            video conferencing or chat lines;</p>
          <p>&#9;• place existing institutional resources on-line that are of 
            interest to the membership and public while adding interest to the 
            web site;</p>
          <p>&#9;• use web sites, electronic mailing lists, listservs and electronic 
            publications to market the services as well as the value of the institution's 
            services;</p>
          <p>&#9;• explore use web sites, listservs, e-mail mailing lists, electronic 
            publications, video and electronic conferencing that can potentially 
            save resources on existing administrative functions;</p>
          <p>&#9;• explore delivery of valued education services on the Internet;</p>
          <p>&#9;• use volunteers to develop the your web site and electronic 
            services;</p>
          <p>&#9;• build special projects for the Internet if it fulfills your 
            institution's mandate and is the most viable medium for the product; 
            and</p>
          <p>&#9;• look for partners in sponsorship and offering services to build 
            on your institution's web site.</p>
          <p>&#9;Throughout this paper, I have attempted to illustrate through 
            example how the Ontario Museum Association and museums in Ontario 
            have used the Internet to develop a volunteer based organization. 
            I am sure there are many other examples and innovative projects in 
            the world that have been left unidentified. We need to be open to 
            the trends in society and the development of new technologies in the 
            development of museum and related institutions new technology services. 
            We all know it is hard to predict the direction new technologies will 
            take in the future. It is important to keep abreast of trends, take 
            the time to investigate the opportunities new technologies present 
            to museums and be creative in our approaches.</p>
