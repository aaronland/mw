          <p> <a name="introduction"></a> <b>INTRODUCTION</b> 
          <p> This paper explores the journey taken by several Canadian and French 
            institutions in the development of a collaborative on-line exhibition: 
            the <a target="_blank" href="../http://www.mcq.org/mcq/index.html">Musée 
            de la Civilisation in Quebec City</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="../http://www.pma.edmonton.ab.ca/">Provincial 
            Museum of Alberta</a> in Edmonton and the <a target="_blank" href="../http://mistral.culture.fr/culture/sedocum/atp-b.htm">Musée 
            national des Arts et traditions populaires</a> in Paris. Coordinated 
            by the <a target="_blank" href="../http://www.pch.gc.ca/">Department 
            of Canadian Heritage</a> and the<a target="_blank" href="../http://www.chin.gc.ca/"> 
            Canadian Heritage Information Network</a> (CHIN), the <a target="_blank" href="../http://web.culture.fr/">Ministère 
            de la Culture française</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="../http://www.culture.fr/culture/dmf.htm">Direction 
            des musées de France</a> these valuable experiences culled from this 
            enterprise have been transformed into a concrete guide that can provide 
            valuable aide to all who embark on a similar adventure. 
          <p> The 1995 virtual exhibition project on the Internet, <a target="_blank" href="../http://www.chin.gc.ca/christmas/"><i>Christmas 
            Traditions in France and Canada</i></a>, marks the fifth anniversary 
            of the Canada-France Agreement Regarding Co-operation and Exchanges 
            in the Field of Museology. The project forms part of a continuing 
            work on a dictionary of religious objects that resulted in the 1994 
            publication of a documentation guide entitled, <i>Religious Objects 
            : User's guide and Terminology</i>. 
          <p> Using new information technologies, partners from Canada and France 
            met in cyberspace to develop this joint presentation about the evolution 
            of rites and customs in our respective countries as well as the cultural 
            context we share. This bilingual virtual exhibition was prepared during 
            a five-month period in 1995 and launched in December 1995. 
          <p> The <i>Christmas Traditions in France and Canada</i> project involved 
            more than 20 professionals, two countries, five cities, two languages, 
            two time zones, distributed information, and a deadline of six months 
            to complete an on-line exhibition about Christmas traditions in Canada 
            and France. Resources included e-mail, Internet, meetings, computer 
            graphics, fax, and conference calls. 
          <p> <a name="theme"></a> <b>WHY CHOOSE CHRISTMAS AS THE THEME?</b> 
          <p> The religious theme was suitable for a test of the Internet medium 
            because it is one of innumerable religious celebrations. The <i>Christmas 
            Traditions in France and Canada</i> project was envisioned as the 
            first in a series of virtual exhibitions on religious celebrations 
            which, because of the possibilities offered by the Internet, could 
            evolve and grow to include celebrations from other religions, thereby 
            adding to the corpus of data. Christmas was chosen as the point of 
            departure because of the common religious traditions of Canada and 
            France for the past 350 years and because of the festive nature of 
            Christmas. 
          <p> <a name="exhibition"></a> <b>WHY CREATE A VIRTUAL EXHIBITION?</b> 
          <p> When the project was first discussed early in 1995, there were few 
            on-line exhibitions and guidelines for preparing one. CHIN has tested 
            new technologies over the years, notably in automated collections 
            management, but also as co-producers of CD-ROMs and a CD-I. The creation 
            of an on-line exhibition grew naturally out of these earlier endeavours. 
          <p> The project had several aims, the principal one being to gain an 
            understanding of the limitations and potential of the medium. As the 
            use of the Internet began to expand in museums, the Canada-France 
            Agreement partners sought to explore the possibilities of technology-based 
            resources that could enhance the ways in which museum professionals 
            performed their jobs. By testing the medium's capacity to be modified 
            or added to, for example, with celebrations from other religions, 
            the team could break down the traditional walls of a museum to create 
            a "24 hour/7 days a week available exhibition" that could meet different 
            levels of interest and expertise found in the exhibition visitors. 
            In contrast to an actual exhibition which would be dismantled or which 
            could not be added to without sufficient physical space, the virtual 
            exhibition holds limitless data. Thus the medium was perceived to 
            be a medium which combined a museum exhibition and a catalogue, with 
            the potential to make accessible objects in museum collections that 
            are not usually available to the public. In addition, this tool allowed 
            us to mount an exhibit in a 5 month period with a limited budget: 
            this would not have been feasible in a physical exhibit context. 
          <p> From the outset, the team planned to create a guide for others planning 
            a similar museum collections-based project. The project was planned 
            and produced as a prototype which was then evaluated by the producers 
            and by exhibition visitors that included museum professionals, students, 
            and cybernauts. The result has been the publication of an evaluation 
            of this virtual exhibit which helped the creation of additional virtual 
            exhibits, available on CHIN's server: <a target="_blank" href="../http://www.chin.gc.ca/" TARGET="_top"><i>http://www.chin.gc.ca</i></a>

        <td width="450"> <a name="evaluation"></a> <b>THE EVALUATION</b> 
          <p> The experiences of those involved in the creation of the <i>Christmas 
            Traditions in France and in Canada</i> virtual exhibition were recorded 
            and subsequently evaluated in order to produce a guide on the production 
            of virtual exhibitions which could be used by other institutions interested 
            in the creation of similar projects, particularly those involving 
            several collaborative and/or international partners. 
          <p> A condensed version of the evaluation, <i>Evaluating and Monitoring 
            the Internet Site "Christmas Traditions in France and in Canada"</i> 
            version is now available on-line at the CHIN Web site (<a target="_blank" href="../http://www.chin.gc.ca/Exhibitions/Virtual_Guide/indexa.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.chin.gc.ca/Exhibitions/Virtual_Guide/indexa.html</a>). 
            <a name="return"></a>The complete hard-copy publication<a href="#*">*</a> 
            provides insight into projects of this nature (international and collaborative) 
            in which museums and technology merge/meet to produce a visually and 
            intellectually rich presentation that educates and entertains a large 
            audience via the Internet. 
          <p> The production team evaluated the process of creating the exhibition 
            and the exhibition visitors evaluated the final product. The evaluation 
            process comprised questionnaires and interviews. The lessons learned 
            from the evaluation became the building blocks for the production 
            guide. The evaluation and guidelines are discussed in three stages: 
            planning, production, and post-production. 
          <p> <b><i>1. Planning:</i></b> 
          <p> The two factors that play a large role in determining the success 
            of a project are, not too surprisingly, time and money. Given the 
            budget constraints and the amount of time available for the Christmas 
            project, much was achieved in a 5-month period. The positive feedback 
            and the huge number of Web visitors during the 8-week period around 
            Christmas attest to the popularity of the exhibition. It is, therefore, 
            critical to the success of the project to plan the project and budget 
            and to have enough time to seek adequate funding. It is understood, 
            however, that it is not uncommon for projects to receive funding with 
            a very short lead time, leaving little or no time for in-depth planning. 
          <p> <b>(Budget)</b> 
          <p> The budget should take into account on a daily, weekly and monthly 
            basis, the cost of the following budget items, which may vary from 
            one project to another. 
          <p> .coordinator/cultural mediator 
          <blockquote> .the key role of the cultural mediator or coordinator is 
            to build bridges between partners in both countries and act as a buffer 
            between the technical, thematic and general scholarly requirements 
            (storyboard and research limitations) and the intentions of the author-writers 
            (including all points of view). </blockquote>
          .scholarly project leader 
          <blockquote> .responsible for the content of the exhibition </blockquote>
          .curators and assistants 
          <p> .technical project leader 
          <blockquote> .planning the day-to-day allocation and sequencing of tasks 
            as well as supervising the progress of the team for the entire duration 
            of the technical production of the project. The leader should act 
            as clearinghouse for all electronic files. </blockquote>
          .scenario writer who has experience writing for the Web 
          <p> .graphics designers 
          <blockquote> .It is a major advantage to have computer graphics designers 
            on board from the start of the project. Their artistic and technical 
            experience can contribute design ideas, help develop navigation routes 
            and make decisions that will meet technical requirements. By being 
            involved from the outset, they become imbued with the "spirit" with 
            which the museum site was created and can thus contribute appropriate 
            and effective graphics. </blockquote>
          .photographers (including processing costs) 
          <p> .digitization (or CD-Photo orders) technicians who specialize in 
            images 
          <p> .programming and production team 
          <blockquote> .committing the technical design of the project to paper 
            makes it possible to determine guidelines, type of tree structure 
            and program lines, exact sequencing of tasks as well as all the basic 
            limitations and decisions that are necessary as a result. </blockquote>
          .translation 
          <blockquote> .translations must be by people who know the research vocabulary 
            well. This is an issue of scholarly accuracy that has an impact on 
            the credibility of the partner museums. </blockquote>
          .additional documentary and iconographic research 
          <p> .unexpected contingencies 
          <blockquote> .the timetable must also allow for unexpected contingencies 
            as well as for monitoring and authorizing work. </blockquote>
          .monitoring and authorizing work 
          <blockquote> .Reproduction and performance rights, and copyright related 
            to the images, song lyrics and musical scores, should not be overlooked 
            when the project budget is set up. </blockquote>
          .travel and accommodation expenses of partners and costs of communication 
          (telephone, mail, fax and electronic mail). 
          <p> <b>(Communication)</b> 
          <p> It is essential to have access to outside expertise, especially 
            from professionals in various areas of culture and publishing, to 
            help identify future partners and skills while at the same time creating 
            a support network for the project. Putting all the stakeholders in 
            touch with one another creates a strong network of partners. 
          <p> One of the first lessons is the importance of allowing sufficient 
            time for the participants to become acquainted and develop the sense 
            of being part of a team. Part of this process involves recognizing 
            and accepting differing cultural perspectives and needs. The project 
            needs sufficient time to reach scholarly agreement on the content 
            before starting. It is this particular interaction that determines 
            how the partners and the various scholarly and museological points 
            of view will complement one another. Thus, prior to the project taking 
            shape, the team welcomed the opportunity for discussion and dialogue. 
            Given the logistics of the team as noted above, distributed in time 
            and space, the communications technologies (conference calls, e-mail, 
            fax) were essential elements that stimulated solid discussions not 
            usually possible using traditional means (i.e. regular mail). 
          <p> The team members responsible for the content of the Christmas project 
            were experts in their fields but it was the first time that many of 
            them had worked on a Web-based project and they came to the project 
            with varying levels of experience in using the Internet. Some had 
            surfed the Net, were familiar with search engines, and had a certain 
            amount of awareness of Web aesthetics. Others were new to the Web 
            and learned as the project developed. Their enthusiasm and interest 
            motivated them to learn quickly. Giving each partner an Internet connection 
            and training in e-mail and groupware tools enhances communication 
            flow and effectiveness. Prior experience, including HTML, would ensure 
            a familiarity with the technology that would foster an awareness of 
            the possibilities and limitations of the Internet. Projects could 
            thus be planned with realistic expectations and time frames. 
          <p> Agreement among the various authors on the design of the exhibition 
            and the target audience helps the team to write text in a more consistent 
            style. The suggestion that hypertext links should be used may seem 
            a good example to follow. Shorter texts can be used, even though the 
            final assembly of all the contributions may require the addition of 
            text to create links. Simple hypertext markup software is already 
            available. 
          <p> As participants pursued their exhibition planning, it became evident 
            that Internet-based exhibitions offer a flexibility that encourages 
            experimentation and dynamism. Participants in the project learned 
            that writing for the Web offers different challenges and opportunities 
            from preparing a traditional in-house exhibition. The Internet allows 
            visitors to select the level of information they wish to consult, 
            thereby offering something to audiences of all ages and experience. 
            The challenge for the team members was to prepare layers of information 
            that increased in complexity. The fact that the on-line exhibition 
            could be linked to relevant and complementary information available 
            at other Web sites further underlined the flexibility and possibilities 
            of this new medium. 
          <p> When planning a virtual exhibition, a number of factors normally 
            considered in actual exhibitions become irrelevant: international 
            boundaries, customs procedures for the movement of works of art, design 
            of exhibition space, loan agreements, insurance policies, conservation 
            work, transportation time for works of art, fixed hours of operation, 
            and number of visitors that can be handled simultaneously. Internet-based 
            exhibitions, complete with dozens or hundreds of images, can be achieved 
            in a shorter period of time and at considerably less expense than 
            an actual exhibition or than a CD-ROM. Given the absence of these 
            constraints, the team had time for rigorous debate on the issues of 
            cultural diversity in time and space in the history of the countries 
            and cultures of the participants, and on the approach to the subject 
            matter. 
          <p> <b>(Digitization)</b> 
          <p> The digitization parameters should be decided at the outset in the 
            interests of uniform image quality. Decisions should be made quickly 
            about image resolution, about whether full-screen images are to be 
            used, about the size of the blow-ups and the image files, as well 
            as about the number of images per screen. These decisions, along with 
            whether the digitization will be done in-house or contracted out, 
            will have an impact on the costs and the final product. At the time 
            of the evaluation, the majority of cybernauts were using a standard 
            35 cm (14 inch) screen. Images should be digitized and adjusted for 
            the current standard, unless a zoom function can be provided to show 
            details. To speed up downloading time, a small thumbnail image that 
            displays quickly could be created, from which full-screen enlargements 
            can be called up. 
          <p> <b><i>2. Production:</i></b> 
          <p> <b>(Communication)</b> 
          <p> -Provide for two or three face-to-face meetings at strategic points 
            during the project. 
          <p> <b>(Partnerships)</b> 
          <p> It is essential to provide for a temporary work in-progress site, 
            available only to partners, so that each party can see the work as 
            it develops, approve it or make suggestions in full knowledge of what 
            is going on. 
          <p> When technical tasks are shared by two countries or institutions, 
            two stand-alone and matching work sites can help to make the project 
            a success. However, remote work techniques and groupware are making 
            multidisciplinary work and file exchange increasingly easy. 
          <p> <b>(Style and Tone of Text)</b> 
          <p> Texts are often written by museum curators or researchers for an 
            institutional site. They are designed to convey scholarly information 
            and often adopt the neutral style of scholarly publications. They 
            should be reworked afterwards in collaboration with a museum educator 
            and a specialist in writing for the Web rather than by the museum-authors. 
            Scholarly texts, which tend to resemble traditional museum catalogues, 
            can be adapted to the "look and feel" of the Web environment given 
            the appropriate amount of time and funding. Comments from Web visitors 
            reveal a saturation threshold that precludes lengthy texts that have 
            a formal, scholarly tone in favour of a personal tone and an emphasis 
            on images.Visitors appreciated hypertext links from the introductory 
            paragraph to subsequent paragraphs.The scenario should integrate scholarly 
            textual and iconographic material as well as suggestions for ways 
            to navigate through it. 
          <p> By working with the graphic artist, the cultural mediator, and the 
            producer from the start, the texts can be produced to reach the audience 
            effectively. 
          <p> <b>(Graphics)</b> 
          <p> HTML limitations required simple lines and primary colours, while 
            computer graphic elements added clarity and highlighted the text. 
            Icons should be readily identifiable original images or images from 
            original documents. 
          <p> Opinions of the site visitors were divided and demonstrated that 
            the graphics presentation will not find universal appeal. Several 
            visitors commented that the Christmas colours and the graphics were 
            simplistic, while others described them as appropriate. Generally, 
            visitors looked for graphics that were less decorative and more meaningful. 
          <p> <b>(Hyperimages)</b> 
          <p> These are images that serve as links between pictures or text. Image 
            captions should be laid out on the text page beside the miniature 
            pictures to which they correspond or should be integrated into the 
            text of the scenario in such a way that the text/image link is made 
            immediately explicit. Visitors expressed their desire for captions 
            that provided details on the origin of objects, collections, the medium, 
            etc. 
          <p> <b>(Hypertext)</b> 
          <p> Hypertext is a word or group of words that serve as links between 
            texts or images. In multimedia applications, writing must be divided 
            into sections and simple ideas must be expressed in single sentences 
            requiring brevity and precision. If there are many lines of text, 
            the reader should be able to return to previous pages without having 
            to go back to the Home Page. 
          <p> <b>(Iconography)</b> 
          <p> The production team learned from site visitors that images should 
            be of high quality and plentiful and should be the focus of the exhibition, 
            with texts playing a supporting role. Most users remember mainly the 
            images after their visit. Full-screen displays, however, require patience 
            while the user waits for the images to download. The annotations and 
            captions may contain hypertext links and/or allow access to other 
            images that can be viewed on-site or in "virtual reserves". 
          <p> An important lesson learned concerning images and preparing the 
            texts during the course of the project was to allow sufficient time 
            early in the project to select the images. The corollary is that sufficient 
            time must be allowed for the research. It is crucial to complete the 
            selection of images at an early stage because of the time needed to 
            settle rights agreements, to digitize the images, to create the captions, 
            and to design the screens and create the links. Image digitization 
            should be carried out as quickly as possible before programming begins: 
            the final choice of which images to include with texts cannot really 
            be made without knowing how the image will look on-screen when it 
            is the size of a postage stamp. A database makes it possible for available 
            images to be identified and indexed together with all their captions, 
            from which the scholarly committee can then make selections. 
          <p> One should allow for two months of intensive iconographic research 
            in order to document 150 to 200 images. The results depend, however, 
            on expertise in the subject, the sites to be used, the number of museums, 
            the work of the scholarly project manager, as well as the time needed 
            to obtain images and the authorization to use them. Iconographic and 
            content research should be carried out simultaneously because this 
            can be very time consuming. The use of thumbnails is important because 
            of the speed of downloading. 
          <p> Living traditions will require on-site reports, hence the need to 
            provide cameras, video recorders and even sound recording equipment. 
            During iconographic research or the photo shoot, thought should be 
            given to choosing objects that might serve as graphic window-dressing 
            for the site after the pictures have been cropped, set up and keyed. 
          <p> <b>(Exhibition Navigation)</b> 
          <p> Having a variety of ways to access the same content enhances broad 
            access to the information. Partners should plan the most effective 
            way to combine multiple points of entry and different methodologies 
            (e.g. theme, time period, image, specific topics or keywords). 
          <p> <b>(Structuring the Documentary Database)</b> 
          <p> Although users thought that the hierarchy was well constructed and 
            understandable, they usually returned to the Home Page to continue 
            browsing. They would have liked to see the hypertext words in a menu. 
          <p> <b><i>3. Post-Production:</i></b> 
          <p> Publicity in traditional media (daily newspapers, trade magazines, 
            radio or television broadcasts, museum events: such as a virtual exhibition 
            launch, a link to a real-life exhibition etc...) is critical since 
            the Internet is still relatively underdeveloped and under used. 
          <p> <a name="conclusions"></a> <b>CONCLUSIONS</b> 
          <p> Has the virtual exhibition been a success? Did it achieve its objectives? 
            The project achieved many of its aims and the producers learned from 
            the experience, to the benefit of the museum community. 
          <p> The international team worked successfully together: it created 
            the exhibition and became more experienced in working with the medium, 
            indicating that a similar result would occur with others. The team 
            members gained the experience in combining their different methodologies 
            and found that the medium allowed for these differences. What might 
            have clashed in a print medium became, in the virtual exhibition, 
            points of entry for site visitors who were thereby offered ways into 
            the project that met their particular points of view. 
          <p> The theme, presented with many images, allowed visitors to navigate 
            through layers of information to meet their interests and needs, thus 
            attracting a wide range of age groups and interests. 
          <p> Positive feedback from around the world demonstrated that the exhibition 
            was highly popular. The CHIN Web server experienced a huge increase 
            in hits - up to 2 million - for the 8-week period around Christmas 
            of 1997. The <i>Christmas Traditions in France and Canada</i> virtual 
            exhibition was designed to appeal to everyone. The project was a success 
            in the sense that users did not identify a special audience. Everyone 
            felt they were included and thought that the site had something of 
            interest for all audiences. The inclusion of different cultures is 
            also an important feature, especially on the Internet, which is an 
            international network. The cultural curiosity of cybernauts may well 
            prevail. 
          <p> <b>(Text/Image Links)</b> 
          <p> The Internet requires interactivity as well as a dynamic relationship 
            between the object that is delivering a message and the concentrated 
            text that is expressed in very few lines. The medium allows for audience 
            interaction and visitors should be given the opportunity to add to 
            the exhibition, or create their own. Additional time and resources 
            would have allowed for components such as interactivity, additions 
            to site, creation of links to other Web sites, and sound and video, 
            and for more in-depth research into the theme and into determining 
            the target audience. 
          <p> <b>(Sound)</b> 
          <p> Users expressed a desire to hear Christmas songs and music and to 
            that end visited the pages on Christmas songs and carols. Users pointed 
            out, furthermore, that sound and excerpts from interviews were dynamic 
            elements that could lighten the daunting effect of too much text, 
            which can make the experience more like reading a dictionary. 
          <p> <b>(The Christmas Theme)</b> 
          <p> User interest waxed and waned depending on the time of year they 
            chose to visit the site. The number of potential users is tied to 
            the marketing strategy. Using a film clip on the Internet, advertising 
            in newspapers, specialized magazines and other media can reach potential 
            users. 
          <p> <b>(Title)</b> 
          <p> The wording of the title expresses what the field of information 
            is and the approach being taken. It means that users do not have to 
            waste time looking for a piece of information that is not there. 
          <p> The new technologies permit a much broader, global distribution 
            than the conventional in-house exhibition, video, or CD-ROM. A Web 
            site can be visited at any hour of the day, in any time zone and from 
            any computer that has an Internet connection. Visitors can find the 
            exhibition through various means, including knowing the URL, following 
            links from related sites, or using a search engine. 
          <p> With on-line questionnaires and e-mail boxes, visitor feedback is 
            immediate. Given the response time and the user-friendly programming, 
            the virtual exhibit can be modified, either by adding or deleting 
            data or by modifying existing information. 
          <p> <a name="good"></a> <b>WHAT MAKES A GOOD VIRTUAL EXHIBITION</b> 
          <p> A virtual exhibition site, like a museum, should make its collection 
            and knowledge accessible to the general public as well as specialist 
            audiences. The site may also encourage people to visit the museum 
            because they can learn about the museum and the activities it provides. 
          <p> Based on the experience of the production team and on the results 
            of the evaluation, elements of a good virtual exhibition include: 
          <p> - providing an opportunity to visit museum exhibitions more than 
            once; 
          <p> - allowing for surprise and wonder, and promoting dreaming and creation; 
          <p> - giving an overall impression of the site on the Home Page; 
          <p> - updating the site on a regular basis to attract visitors and keep 
            them coming back; 
          <p> - using source material provided by the medium to enhance meaning; 
          <p> - displaying images that can be used on the Internet; 
          <p> - designing the project like a research tool; 
          <p> - providing access to normally inaccessible documents; 
          <p> - ensuring research projects have international dissemination; 
          <p> - "hooking" visitors by making browsing pleasant; 
          <p> - touching users' emotions; 
          <p> - providing the opportunity to prepare people for a visit to a museum 
          <p> <b>(Christmas Tree)</b> 
          <p> It is thus desirable to: 
          <p> - create a Home Page index, and 
          <p> - lay out the Home Page graphics on a page-screen in such a way 
            that users do not have to scroll down the page to access the suggested 
            themes. 
          <p> The exhibition planning raised important questions about the nature 
            of an exhibition: are virtual exhibitions "real" exhibitions or are 
            they a hybrid of traditional and multimedia? The team sees these questions 
            as part of a developing discourse that as yet has no solid answers.
