            <i>"Too often, the computer is used in the schools, as it is used 
            in other social establishments, as a quick technological fix. It is 
            used to paper over fundamental problems to create the illusion that 
            they are being attacked.</i></CENTER>

              <i>&nbsp;If Johnny can't read and somebody writes a computer software 
              that will improve Johnny's reading score a little bit for the present, 
              then the easiest thing to do is to bring in the computer and sit 
              Johnny down at it. This makes it unnecessary to ask why Johnny can't 
              read. In other words, it makes it unnecessary to reform the school 
              system, or for that matter the society that tolerates the breakdown 
              of its schools."&nbsp;<a name="bm1"></a>[<a href="#en1">1</a>]</i>
            </center>
            <p>&nbsp; <br>
              I have been using computers for over 20 years; developing collections 
              management systems for the last 10 years; been on the 'Net for 8 
              years. I believe that digital multimedia and web technologies have 
              an enormous potential for delivering educational content. I am not 
              as optimistic that the potential of these technologies will ever 
              be realized. I have reluctantly come to this conclusion for two 
              reasons. First, the historic patterns adoption and use of earlier 
              information technologies in classroom for over the last century. 
              Second, is the "productivity paradox" of I.T. in the service sector. 
              These are large complex phenomenon, and I can not hope to cover 
              them in either detail or depth in a short paper. However, I would 
              like to bring forward certain aspects of this problem and point 
              to avenues for further research.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;The first section of this paper deals with the application 
              of Information Technology (I.T.) to the central mission of museums, 
              "to collect, to preserve and to educate". In particular I wish to 
              address the educational aspects of this mission. Under this heading 
              I will be as inclusive as possible bringing all activities undertaken 
              by museums undertaken with the intent to impart information about 
              the museum, its collections and its programs to the public. My definition 
              of the public is meant to include all classes of students, from 
              kindergarten to adult learners, as well as professional requests 
              from for information from scholars and other colleagues.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;The second part of the paper discusses a few of the many 
              studies have shown that the introduction of I.T. has not significantly 
              increased per capita productivity of companies. Since the Web is 
              often sold as a medium for efficiently delivering educational programming 
              to a wide audience I think this evidence is worth considering. One 
              of the fears I have is that in our rush to adopt computer-based 
              communication technologies and restructure our institutions to make 
              use them, do we run the risk of losing more than we might gain? 
              What might be the long-term side effects for museums of "being digital" 
              and can we see parallels in the digital conversion of other sectors 
              of the economy? [<a name="bm2"></a><a href="#en2">2</a>]&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Obviously I am not the first observer to pose such questions. 
              I certainly will not be the last. Motion pictures, radio, television, 
              and computers each promised to revolutionise education, none of 
              these technologies did. If you look at the spectrum of content produced 
              for each of these media today there are isolated islands of excellence 
              among vast seas of mediocrity (For those of you who are frequent 
              users of the Web you might have noticed a similar trend?). The relatively 
              recent introduction into museums of the Internet and its offspring, 
              the Web and Intranets, have similar revolutionary claims made for 
              them. Before we fill our digital galleries and digital storerooms 
              with digital objects perhaps we should pull back for a moment, and 
              see if there are lessons to be learned from the earlier information 
              technologies.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;By the end of the paper I hope we can begin to look at some 
              of the following questions. In a different economic environment, 
              would we have chosen the web as a primary communication vehicle? 
              Museums have undergone a period of tremendous re-structuring and 
              re-focusing over the last five years. In this period of turmoil 
              we have, perhaps paradoxically, seen a huge growth in the use of 
              computer-based information technologies in museums (at all levels 
              of education for that matter). Has this money been well spent, or 
              are we papering over the cracks? In our enthusiasm for this technology, 
              and its apparent short-term successes, are we really endangering 
              our long-term goals? The bottom line question I would like to try 
              to address is simple, with all this I.T. are we doing our job better 
              or not?&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;<b>The Mission of Museums</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Perhaps the most significant problems in trying to deploy 
              I.T. towards meeting the mission of the institution is trying to 
              define what our job is supposed to be. For the purposes of this 
              paper, I will use the ICOM's definition of a museum. [<a name="bm3"></a><a href="#en3">3</a>]&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;A solid understanding of our corporate mission is a fundamental 
              pre-requisite is we are to successfully design, develop and implement 
              I.T. based initiatives to further these aims. All too often, however, 
              projects are doomed to failure before they begin because of a lack 
              of understanding of the museum's mission. Fortunately a detailed 
              discussion of this wide-ranging museological debate is clearly beyond 
              the scope of this paper. But as a starting point for debate I would 
              propose that the mission of museums (based on the ICOM definition) 
              would have something to do with presenting objects to people in 
              an educational and entertaining fashion [<a name="bm4"></a><a href="#en4">4</a>].&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Someone once said, that anyone who thinks education and entertainment 
              are two opposite poles knows nothing about either education or entertainment. 
              While I would tend to agree, in general terms, with this sentiment, 
              I do not intend to explore the purely entertainment possibilities 
              for museums on the Web. I've found that museums are not very good 
              game developers, and on a more personal level I am still trying 
              to decide whether the term "educational game" is an oxymoron or 
              whether at a fundamental level all games are educational. While 
              I do appreciate the perceived need for museums to sell themselves 
              I will not discuss museum-marketing ventures using the Web.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;<b>I.T. and Education</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;The first part of this essay consists of a historical examination 
              of the deployment and use of I.T. in classroom settings. I am taking 
              this approach for two reasons. First, I think we can all agree on 
              the fact that museums are classrooms, and that most educational 
              applications of the Web we have implemented have classrooms as at 
              least one of the target audiences. More specifically, the justification 
              heard most often for web development in museums is providing access 
              to the vast stores of knowledge museum's hold for broad educational 
              purposes. Second, this gives us a relatively well documented record 
              for several different I.T.s over a considerable time depth. Spinoza 
              observed that, "if you want the present to be different from the 
              past, study the past". In this spirit I suggest if we wish to make 
              best use of "information technology" we need to examine the use 
              of earlier information technologies in an educational setting. This 
              should allow us to perceive any historical patterns of deployment 
              and use that might be present. Therefore let us begin by to considering 
              the Web's I.T. ancestors: motion pictures, radio, television, and 
              the networked computer.&nbsp;

            <p>&nbsp;<b>Motion Pictures</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Here is a 1913 statement by the technology expert of his 
              day, Mr. Thomas Alva Edison, tell me if the claim sound familiar:&nbsp;<br>
              <center>
                <i>"Books will soon be obsolete in the schools." [<a name="bm5"></a><a href="#en5">5</a>]</i>
              </center>
            <p>&nbsp;This was Mr. Edison's claim that the new I.T. marvel, the 
              motion picture, would bring about a new era in public education. 
              The death of the book and its replacement by this new I.T. promised 
              to give students a direct experience of the world, unmediated by 
              the limitations of the printed page that had held their minds hostage 
              since Guttenberg.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Nine years later, in 1922, Mr. Edison remarks again on the 
              impending changes. He says,&nbsp;<br>
              <center>
                <i>"I believe that the motion picture is destined to revolutionize 
                our educational system and that in a few years it will supplant 
                largely, if not entirely, the use of textbooks." [<a name="bm6"></a><a href="#en6">6</a>]</i>
              </center>
            <p>&nbsp;By the 1920s the motion picture industry had begun to bring 
              about fundamental change in the entertainment industry [<a name="bm7"></a><a href="#en7">7</a>], 
              but the revolution in education promised from the promoters of motion 
              pictures would never come.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;U.S. National Education Association surveys done in 1946 
              and 1951 of motion picture use in urban school districts clearly 
              support this observation. The number of teachers who "never" or 
              only "occasionally" used the technology remained remarkably consistent 
              between these two surveys. In 1946 68% of elementary, 63% of junior 
              high school and 85% of senior high school fell into these user groups. 
              A survey conducted in 1954 found 58% of elementary and 77% of secondary 
              teachers either never or occasionally used them. (For comparative 
              purposes if you average the 1946 secondary score you get 74%.) [<a name="bm8"></a><a href="#en8">8</a>]&nbsp; 
              <br>
              &nbsp; <br>
              &nbsp;Larry Cuban in his 1986 book, <i>Teachers and Machines: The 
              Classroom use of technology since 1920</i>, cites four reasons for 
              the low effectiveness of film in the classroom:&nbsp; 
            <ol>
              <ul>
                <li> Teacher lack of skill in using the equipment and films;</li>
                <li> Costs of the films, equipment and maintenance;</li>
                <li> Inaccessibility of the equipment when it is needed;</li>
                <li> Finding and fitting the right film to the class. [<a name="bm9"></a><a href="#en9">9</a>]</li>
              </ul>
            </ol>
            &nbsp;In other words, the four primary factors limiting adoption or 
            use are as follows: 1) technical skills needed to employing the technology; 
            2) the cost of the technology; 3) accessibility to the technology 
            as needed; and, 4) appropriate educational/curriculum content [<a name="bm10"></a><a href="#en10">10</a>]. 
            These are recurring themes with each of the "revolutionary" educational 
            I.T.s.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Radio</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;About the time Edison was making his 1922 prediction, the 
              US Department of Commerce was beginning to license educational and 
              commercial radio stations. The first known classroom use is in New 
              York City in 1923 [<a name="bm11"></a><a href="#en11">11</a>]. Ten 
              years later, Benjamin Darrow, an early enthusiast of radio in education 
              made the statement in 1932 that,&nbsp; 
              <center>
                <i>"[t]he central and dominant aim of education by radio is to 
                bring the world to the classroom, to make universally available 
                the services of the best teachers, the inspiration of the greatest 
                leaders, ... and unfolding world events which through radio may 
                come as a vibrant and challenging textbook of the air." [<a name="bm12"></a><a href="#en12">12</a>]</i>
              </center>
            <p>&nbsp;By the 1940s one study of 1900 California schools shows 66% 
              with radio sets in the classroom [<a name="bm13"></a><a href="#en13">13</a>]. 
              However, the same survey found that regular use by 1 or more teachers 
              per school was 8% at the elementary level and 5% at the secondary 
              level. The same issues of end user technical skills, cost, accessibility 
              and content limited its use as an instructional media [<a name="bm14"></a><a href="#en14">14</a>].&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Television</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;I am (just) old enough that one of my earliest memories of 
              public school is sitting cross-legged on the floor in the hallway 
              staring intently at a large colour television set. I, along with 
              the rest of my grade one class (and the rest of the population of 
              the school for that matter) were watching one of the NASA space 
              launches of the early 1960s [<a name="bm15"></a><a href="#en15">15</a>]. 
              Or I remember being allowed to stay up past my bedtime to see Kenneth 
              Clarke discussing the history of art in his 13 part TV series <i>CIVILISATION 
              [<a name="bm16"></a><a href="#en16">16</a>]</i> aired in 1970 or 
              Jacob Bronowski's, <i>The Ascent of Man</i> in 1973 [<a name="bm17"></a><a href="#en17">17</a>].&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;On the surface, my personal recollections seem to support 
              the claims of a 1961 study by the Ford Foundation for the Advancement 
              of Education.&nbsp;

                history and nature. A whole treasure-trove of new and stimulating 
                experiences that were beyond the reach of yesterday's students

              </center>
            <p>&nbsp;In fact, what I do remember is a general feeling of excitement 
              and wonder, as much related to the departure from our usual school 
              schedule, as the blast off itself. What I have no recall of is any 
              discussion (beyond the initial, "isn't technology neat!") relating 
              the image on the screen to activities in my classroom. While this 
              is hardly a scientific observation about the classroom use of TV, 
              I don't think my experience is unique. (The only other time I can 
              remember a TV in my class was in 1972 for the Canada-Russia hockey 
              series.)&nbsp; 
            <p>While there were experiments in the 1930s and 1940s with both broadcast 
              and closed circuit educational TV programming, it wasn't until 1953 
              that the Federal Communication Commission awarded broadcast licenses 
              for the first 242 educational stations in the U.S. [<a name="bm19"></a><a href="#en19">19</a>] 
              It took another 10 years for first the Ford Foundation, then the 
              US Office of Education to put any significant funding into educational 
              TV [<a name="bm20"></a><a href="#en20">20</a>]. After millions of 
              dollars invested, the level of classroom use of TV was no better 
              than that of motion pictures or radio[<a name="bm21"></a><a href="#en21">21</a>].&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;The discussions of the factors governing (non-) adoption 
              of TV as an educational tool in the 1960s are remarkably similar 
              to those for the earlier (and later) I.T.s: cost to implement and 
              maintain; flexibility of the media; comprehension and control of 
              the media by the teacher; student response; support for, instead 
              of replacement of, current practice; fad and pressure [<a name="bm22"></a><a href="#en22">22</a>].&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Clifford Stoll, author of <i>Silicon Snake Oil</i>, raises 
              an interesting question regarding the effectiveness of "educational 
              television". He asks, "'Sesame Street,' widely acclaimed as an outstanding 
              program for children, has been around for twenty years. Indeed, 
              its idea of making learning relevant at all was as widely promoted 
              in the seventies as the Internet is today. So where's the demographic 
              wave of creative and brilliant students now entering college?" [<a name="bm23"></a><a href="#en23">23</a>] 
              Put it another way, we have run this experiment in educational television 
              on our children for over 20 years, has anyone stopped to consider 
              the results?&nbsp; 
            <p><b>&nbsp;</b>An interesting bridge between traditional print materials, 
              TV and computers (a truly multimedia experience) in "<i>The Voyage 
              of the Mimi"</i> and its sequel<i> "The Second Voyage of the Mimi"[<a name="bm24"></a><a href="#en24">24</a>].</i> 
              The original project was funded with a $3.65 million dollar grant 
              and co-produced by the U.S. Department of Education, the Banks Street 
              College of Education, the Public Broadcasting Corporation and the 
              publishers Holt, Rinehart and Winston. In his book, <i>Amusing Ourselves 
              to Death</i>, New York University professor and media critic Neil 
              Postman presents a troubling analysis of this type of "educational" 
              experiment. Postman concludes his discussion with the following 
              assertion, "I would suggest that "The Voyage of the Mimi" was conceived 
              by someone's asking the question, what is television good for?, 
              not, what is education good for?" [<a name="bm25"></a><a href="#en25">25</a>]&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;What Postman and Stoll are criticising is the influence entertainment 
              is having on education. This perceived need to make learning 'fun' 
              expresses itself by the creators of educational media as infotainment 
              or edutainment. This trend has already had a perceptible impact 
              on museum exhibitions and programming.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Museums and the Web</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;In 1992 the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) releases 
              WWW [<a name="bm26"></a><a href="#en26">26</a>] and in the same 
              year one of the first on-line exhibits, "Revelations from the Russian 
              Archives", a selection of materials from the Russian Archives displayed 
              at the Library of Congress [<a name="bm27"></a><a href="#en27">27</a>]. 
              The information was delivered as GIF and ASCII files from an anonymous 
              ftp server this experiment demonstrates some of the potential for 
              delivering heritage information over the Internet. As ground breaking 
              as this initiative was we should remember it is employing technology 
              nearly 20 years old at the time [<a name="bm28"></a><a href="#en28">28</a>].&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;In 1994 the US National Center for Supercomputing Applications 
              (NCSA) in the U.S. releases Mosaic[<a name="bm29"></a><a href="#en29">29</a>]. 
              The Library of Congress followed up the Russian archives exhibit 
              in 1993 with "Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance 
              Culture"[<a name="bm30"></a><a href="#en30">30</a>], an exhibit 
              based on material from the Vatican Library. In a 1993 review of 
              the exhibit David Bearman observed the limitations of this new media. 
              He makes the following observation after visiting the exhibit with 
              a Mosaic browser running on a SPARC workstation running at the University 
              of Pittsburgh's School of Library and Information Science:&nbsp; 
              <center>
                <i>"By opening several windows, the user can read the text, view 
                the object and correlate both with the master list of references 
                but the texts average only a few hundred words per image and bring 
                JPEG images across the network and then mapping them to my 8 bit 
                screen, requires several minutes each. This precludes "browsing" 
                or even perceiving the online format as an exhibit; the result 
                is that the database is suitable only for research and only by 
                someone who has already studied the published catalog and perhaps 
                printed out the master list for local study."[<a name="bm31"></a><a href="#en31">31</a>]</i>
              </center>
            <p>&nbsp;In short, Bearman cites the low resolution of the images, 
              the slow speed for downloading, the limited amount of supporting 
              text, and I would add the high cost of the hardware and technical 
              support, were major detracting factors from the appropriateness 
              of the technology for its purpose.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;These criticisms notwithstanding, I feel the most important 
              implication comes from the final sentence. If "the database is suitable 
              only for research" and by someone who has printed out the master 
              list and studies the published catalogue, why create the Web site 
              in the first place? Could not the same aims be served by reducing 
              the cost and increasing the distribution of the paper catalogue?&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Why the Technology Failed to Deliver the Promised Goods 
              in the Past</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Why has I.T. historically failed to deliver the promised 
              goods in terms of improvement of education? From the classroom perspective 
              I think we can see a historical pattern emerging. It begins with 
              enthusiastic early adoption of the technology usually backed up 
              with grandiose claims from its proponents. This revolution gets 
              buoyed up politically with infusions of research grants. This in 
              turn leads to over inflated expectations on the part of users, under 
              critical examination of results by developers, and structural resistance 
              within organizations. Finally obscurity for the vector of the "educational 
              revolution" as we rampage towards the next technological wonder. 
              If you think this interpretation is extreme, look what is happening 
              to the funding for public television as governments pour hundreds 
              of millions of dollars into the "information highway".&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Many might say that my analysis so far is overly cynical 
              and there have been many successes. Unfortunately this unbridled 
              optimism may tend to obscure the actual situation. In publicizing 
              the successful projects and ignoring the failures we skew the truth 
              about our use of I.T. We should bear in mind that 31% of all I.T 
              projects are cancelled before completion, and of those remaining 
              52% run over&nbsp;<a name="bm32"></a>budget [<a href="#en32">32</a>]. 
              These facts alone should be enough to fire up the warning rockets.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Before proceeding I would like to raise three general points 
              to consider as possible underlying causes for the historical failures. 
              The first important point is the very fact that all the enthusiastic 
              statements about the impact of I.T. were predictions. And the simple 
              truth of it is we are not very good at predicting the future, particularly 
              when we are dealing with complex phenomena [<a name="bm33"></a><a href="#en33">33</a>]. 
              My second point follow on from this. These predictions were based 
              on a <i>belief</i> in technology, rather than any real <i>evidence</i> 
              for either its effectiveness or its appropriateness as a learning 
              tool. This is an important theme in examining any technology's claim 
              to be better than what it wants to replace, and something we will 
              return to later in this essay. The final point I wish to raise from 
              examining these two statements is this, "What is the relationship 
              of the speaker to the technology being touted?" Or as William Y. 
              Arms, Vice-President for Computing Services at Carnegie Mellon University 
              expressed it "I am an enthusiast about electronic information, and 
              enthusiasts must be treated with caution."[<a name="bm34"></a><a href="#en34">34</a>]&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Politics, Education and Business: Alternative Perspectives</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;I think that what we have been observing here is a complex 
              interplay between politicians, educators and the business community. 
              Each brings their own concerns and agendas to the table. I think 
              we would all agree the heritage community as a whole has not been 
              entirely successful in impacting the concerns or agendas of these 
              much more powerful and organized segments of society.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Political Myth</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;One of the possible reasons for the failures we have to date 
              is how these technologies were brought to bear on the problem. The 
              approach to deployment that stresses top-down management and development 
              might be part of the problem.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;There are two important issues that come into play when systems 
              are imposed from above. First, you get a certain level of user resistance 
              to the changes. This is particularly true when the users feel they 
              have been allowed little input into the key decisions about the 
              system. Second, the top-down design and implementation model tends 
              to miss important factors unless efforts are made to these systemic 
              defects with a bottom-up check to the model. This is a common approach 
              in relational system design and data modeling. We see both these 
              in the historic data expressed as teacher resistance to the using 
              the technology and the complaint that there is little appropriate 
              content to use in the classroom.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;I think it cannot be coincidental that the enormous interest 
              in the Web occurred following the 1992 US presidential election. 
              Vice-President Al Gore has been the high-level champion of this 
              technology beginning in his days in the Senate [<a name="bm35"></a><a href="#en35">35</a>]. 
              Richard Joseph's 1997 analysis of the political mythology of the 
              "Information Superhighway" documents how US initiatives had immediate 
              and far-reaching repercussions worldwide. He argues that concepts 
              like this spread so quickly and uncritically is based on the tendency 
              to use what are seen as successful implementations as models. Whether 
              or not the model is appropriate to local circumstances. From an 
              Australian perspective he examines defines, high technology, deregulation 
              and the information superhighway as models taken from the US and 
              UK, and there application to local circumstances [<a name="bm36"></a><a href="#en36">36</a>].&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;While Joseph is examining this phenomenon at the level of 
              national governments, this issue of model adoption is clearly applicable 
              to museums and the Web. Models of systems developed for large, well-funded 
              museums and organizations may not be applicable to smaller, not 
              so well funded institutions. However, these are the systems held 
              out as examples of what is possible for us to emulate. Too often 
              we end up developing a Web site we can not support when the grant 
              runs out because we did not look critically enough at the underlying 
              model we were being offered.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Vartan Gregorian noted that "[i]n an era of fixed resources, 
              this means reallocating existing resources. Growth can only be by 
              substitution, not addition." [<a name="bm37"></a><a href="#en37">37</a>] 
              In Canada we have seen a decade of cuts at all levels of government 
              to museum operating budgets. Private sector funding has not made 
              up for these shortfalls and we have all been downsized to a greater 
              or lesser extent. In this environment we have seen a great deal 
              of spending in the area of information technology in museums.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;In Canada, the SchoolNet program of Industry Canada [<a name="bm38"></a><a href="#en38">38</a>] 
              has connected 70% of all Canadian schools to the Internet. By the 
              end of 1998 their goal is to have all schools will be connected. 
              Since there are 12,402 elementary and 3,468 secondary schools in 
              Canada [<a name="bm39"></a><a href="#en39">39</a>] this is a truly 
              impressive accomplishment. Not to mention an enormous capital and 
              operating cost. Part of the program, the SchoolNet Digital Collection, 
              is designed to assist museums, libraries and archives to place relevant 
              Canadian content onto the Web. Each project receives a grant of 
              $25,000 to pay unemployed youth to digitise collections. The project 
              has been very successful in getting material on-line. However, there 
              are no additional funds for the museums to continue to develop their 
              new site once the grant is gone and I have seen no follow up evaluation 
              regarding the use or usefulness of the content. I have to wonder 
              aloud if the museum was offered a $25,000 grant to spend anyway 
              it choose would this be number one on its priority list? Or if we 
              could direct the money would it be better spent on bringing up the 
              quality of the institution's inventory or catalogue records?&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Education Myth</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;There has been a certain mythology associated with hypermedia 
              applications in relation to their use as learning tools. Andrew 
              Dillon presents arguments regarding what he considers the four widely 
              held myths regarding hypermedia:<sup> </sup>1) Associative linking 
              of information is natural in that it mimics the workings of the 
              human mind; 2)&nbsp; 
            <p>Paper is a linear and therefore a constraining medium; 3) Rapid 
              access to a large manipulatible mass of information will lead to 
              better use and learning; 4) Future technologies will solve all current 
              problems [<a name="bm40"></a><a href="#en40">40</a>]. If Dillon 
              is correct (and I believe he is) then the underlying assumptions 
              we have about the Web as a superior learning medium are wrong. Let's 
              briefly consider each of these in turn.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Dillon states the assumption that associative linking really 
              models the human mind is largely unsupported by cognitive studies. 
              The work of Roger Penrose, Daniel Dennett and others seem to support 
              this conclusion [<a name="bm41"></a><a href="#en41">41</a>].&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Novels, motion pictures, and lesson plans all have a beginning, 
              middle and an end. The most effective teaching (regardless of media 
              or transmission method) has clearly articulated learning goals and 
              a methodology for presenting these to the student. I think one of 
              the great failures of the Web as a learning media is its lack of 
              structure. The ability for the student to get distracted from the 
              lesson at hand and follow whatever might grab their attention probably 
              does as much to keep it from being utilized as any other reason.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;A 1995 US Department of Education report reports that 50% 
              of all schools had Internet access, but only 2% of teachers and 
              3% of students making use of on-line resources. I do not find these 
              figures interesting from a historical perspective of I.T. adoption 
              in the classroom. They lend support for Dillon's third myth that 
              a large mass of on-line data will improve learning. Thomas Lowderbaugh 
              developing curriculum support material for the Smithsonian Institution's 
              Ocean Planet exhibit in 1995 concludes that the correlation between 
              the lack of use and the lack of teacher access is in fact a causal 
              relationship. Teachers can't get access so they don't the materials 
              [<a name="bm42"></a><a href="#en42">42</a>]. This explanation might 
              be too simple. Kevin Donovan's does not support this causal relationship. 
              He states that "[s]imply providing the public with access to data 
              is insufficient to satisfy the goal of public education." What he 
              is calling for is better access to value-added information not just 
              a few online exhibitions or our collection catalogues [<a name="bm43"></a><a href="#en43">43</a>]. 
              I think we can all agree that the educational market is highly segmented. 
              Detailed studies on learning styles and client needs will allow 
              us to better understand the needs of each of these groups [<a name="bm44"></a><a href="#en44">44</a>].&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Business Myth</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Last year at this conference Kevin Donovan of Willoughby 
              Associates raised the issue of I.T. in museums when he wrote,&nbsp; 
              <center>
                <i>"that museums are making this investment [in automation technology] 
                is all the more surprising given the unsatisfactory rates of return 
                (ROI) that the past twenty years of pouring money and staff into 
                museum automation projects has yielded, with the exception of 
                gains in two areas: office automation and audit responsibilities 
                of collections."[<a name="bm45"></a><a href="#en45">45</a>]</i>
              </center>
            <p>&nbsp;This echoes the 1990 findings of a study by P. Weill from 
              an examination of commercial applications where gains were found 
              in application of transactional systems (for example data processing), 
              but were absent in either strategic systems (e.g. sales support) 
              or informational investments (e.g. email infrastructure) [<a name="bm46"></a><a href="#en46">46</a>].&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Those studying it have christened this problem the "Productivity 
              Paradox", and it is one of the most interesting conundrums about 
              the I.T. revolution. The statement "we see computers everywhere 
              but not in the productivity statistics" attributed to Nobel Prize 
              economist Robert Solow [<a name="bm47"></a><a href="#en47">47</a>] 
              succinctly expresses our dilemma we face in trying to quantify the 
              relationship between our spending on I.T. and its supposed improvements 
              in the operation of our businesses. There has been a growing body 
              of analysis since the mid-1980s that the loss of productivity seen, 
              particularly in the service sector, may be attributed to the wide 
              spread deployment of I.T.. Steven Roach, an economist with Morgan 
              Stanley provided the first econometric underpinnings for the conclusion 
              that information worker has not increased for more than 20 years 
              despite (or perhaps because) of increasing amounts of I.T. being 
              deployed [<a name="bm48"></a><a href="#en48">48</a>]. Paul Strassmann 
              [<a name="bm49"></a><a href="#en49">49</a>], Erik Brynjolfsson [<a name="bm50"></a><a href="#en50">50</a>] 
              and Thomas Landauer [<a name="bm51"></a><a href="#en51">51</a>] 
              all provide major analyses supporting this conclusion. However, 
              a later study by Brynjolfsson and Hitt of firm-level productivity 
              seems to run counter to this trend [<a name="bm52"></a><a href="#en52">52</a>].&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;This has important implications for I.T. in museums. Collectively 
              we have had nearly 40 years experience and some measure of success 
              with data processing applications, usually collections management 
              systems. In the last decade we increasing amounts of I.T. is being 
              deployed in all areas of the museum. Usually with all fingers pointing 
              to how it has increased the efficiency of collection management 
              functions. If these economic studies are to be believed much of 
              this money could have been better spent.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Are We Doing Our Job Better? Areas for Additional Inquiry</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;I have spent the last 4800 words presenting a picture of 
              information technology misunderstood and misapplied. With the huge 
              sums of money being spent on creating a Web presence for museums 
              I guess I expected more. I don't think we are living up to our own 
              hype, and we actually stand in peril of believing the stuff we put 
              in our grant applications. I think at present the weight of evidence 
              stands against us.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Even through this weight of cynicism and fear I remain hopeful. 
              We have been presented with a wonderful tool for furthering the 
              mission of museums. We need to remember, however, it is only one 
              tool and might not always be the best tool for the job at hand. 
              We need to stand back and look at it for what the Web really is 
              today, not for the magical potential it might possess. It is a tool 
              unlike anything we have been handed before. We need to consider 
              carefully how we deploy it, and at what cost.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;We need real costs and better case studies before can we 
              even begin to answer the questions of how to use the Web. We need 
              to measure both our successes and more importantly our failures. 
              We need solid econometrics to replace decisions made on beliefs.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;There are learning curve issues internal (staff) and external 
              (user) to our institutions regarding the technology adoption cycle 
              for the Web. We need to understand the end user better - appreciating 
              the significant differences in primary, secondary, post-secondary 
              and continuing education markets. Most of all we need to avoid, 
              as Postman would say, presenting entertainment as education. The 
              worst side effect of the Web could be the continued "dumbing down" 
              of inherently difficult concepts to meet the needs of the "edu-tainment" 
              market.&nbsp; 
            <p>&nbsp;Finally we need to remember why museums are museums - our 
              collections. I know that every major museum now has to be equipped 
              with a bookstore, gift shop, bar, restaurant, and live Sunday afternoon 
              jazz. And that these are important for "reaching out to the community", 
              "improving the visitor experience", and generating revenue. But, 
              people come to our museums see our stuff, and hear what our experts 
              can tell them about the objects. Nothing can replace the child's 
              (or adult's for that matter) experience of the real thing. And all 
              the "virtual museums" on the Web are not going to change that.&nbsp;

              Industry Canada and not Heritage Canada (which is responsible for 
              museums). This could be because parts of the project, such as SchoolNet 
              Digital Collections which creates new Canadian content for the Web, 
              are actually job creation schemes for unemployed youth as well as
