            <h3>MUSENOR : The Virtual Collection of the <i>Musées du Nord-Pas 
              de Calais</i>, some thirty French Museums</h3>
            <p> 
            <h4><a href="../../bios/simon.html">Bruno 
              B. SIMON</a>, Association des Conservateurs de musées du Nord-Pas 
              de Calais</h4></p>
            <big>A first in France</big> 
            <p> The Web site project being undertaken by the «&nbsp;Association 
              des conservateurs de musées du Nord-Pas de Calais (ACMNPDC)&nbsp;» 
              - North and Pas de Calais museum curator association- is a first 
              in France as far as new technologies linked to the diffusion of 
              cultural information via the Internet is concerned. As a matter 
              of fact, the objective is to coordinate the digitizing and cataloguing 
              of the regional museum art works in order to supply a multimedia 
              data base in which every file will include a minimal scientific 
              description and a digital picture of each entry. 
            <p> <big>The French backwardness</big> 
            <p> Whether reading an article or watching a television show on computer 
              technology in France, you cannot escape the French obsession with 
              being technologically behind the times. But what is the truth? Here 
              are some figures and a short explanation. 
            <p> It is true that the Internet has not yet taken off in France and 
              that, in comparison to the United States, very few households are 
              connected. But one must bear in mind that an average American family 
              has 20% more disposable income than its French equivalent, a personal 
              computer costs 15% less in the United States, software runs as much 
              as 40% less, and local telecommunications which are used to connect 
              to the Internet cost virtually nothing. 
            <p> Under these conditions, it is understandable that the general 
              public in France does not yet see Internet as accessible and/or 
              as a valuable investment. 
            <p> While a good number of British, Canadian and American museums 
              are already on the web, in France talk is all about being behind 
              the times. France seems almost reluctant to take part in the digital 
              revolution for fear of staking too much on the future, regardless 
              of the future handicaps it would imply. 
            <p> The Nord-Pas de Calais region, situated on the border of Belgium, 
              was not an Internet forerunner until November 28th 1994 when it 
              was chosen by the European Commission as a pilot region for the 
              IRISI project (Inter-regional Initiatives for the Information Society). 
              This program aims to assist in the development of projects taking 
              part in the emerging information society. Five other areas will 
              be subsidized by the European Union&nbsp;: The free State of Saxe, 
              the Valencia Community, Piedmont, Central Macedonia and the North 
              western area of England.

          <td width="450"> <big>A dynamic area</big> 
            <p> The region concerned is divided into two administrative «&nbsp;départements&nbsp;», 
              Nord and Pas de Calais whose main towns are respectively Lille, 
              Dunkirk, Valenciennes, Roubaix, Tourcoing and Arras, Calais. With 
              seven urban areas of more than 100,000 inhabitants each and a total 
              population of almost 4 million ( 7% of the French population), it 
              is the third industrial area of France although it has been hit 
              hard by the economic crisis within the industrial sector. <br>

              <br>
              Around 250 promotional actions and projects were put into place 
              in the area before IRISI was completed in March 1997. As the October 
              1997 issue of «&nbsp;Netsurf&nbsp;» magazine stated&nbsp: «&nbsp;1997 
              will most likely be remembered as the year The Internet hit the 
              region.&nbsp;». 
            <p> Such was the highly charged atmosphere and experimental background 
              in which the Association decided, as soon as 1995, to start the 
              digitizing of the art works in order to to set up a «&nbsp;virtual 
              collection&nbsp;»

            <p> <big>The Nord-Pas de Calais museum curators association</big> 
            <p> Created in 1975, the association is a regional branch of the General 
              Association of Curators of French Public Collections. 50 curators 
              and assistant curators working in the 33 museums of the area are 
              affiliated to it. 
            <p> From the beginning, it has been organizing activities in order 
              to promote the quality and diversity of the collections&nbsp;. 
            <p> The Association contributes to the cultural, social and tourist 
              development of the region, and has received recognition and support 
              from a variety of public offices: The Ministry of Culture, the Regional 
              Council for the Nord-Pas de Calais, The Council General of both 
              the Nord and Pas de Calais regions, as well as the European Union. 
            <p> The Association has published 16 issues of «&nbsp;Treasures of 
              the museums of the Nord region&nbsp;»; and a catalogue called «&nbsp;Ten 
              years of FRAM acquisitions&nbsp;». ( Regional Fund for Museum Acquisitions). 
            <p> As a project manager for the computerization of the museums' collections, 
              the Association has also undertaken to inventory, protect and restore, 
              as well as appraise the value of the photographic collections preserved 
              in the regional museums. The association also helps the museums 
              cope with more practical problems such as, visitors, activities, 
              tourism, information and promotion. 
            <p> <big>The digitizing project</big> 
            <p> The 50 ACMNPDC members who are taking part in the digitizing project 
              which aims to cover within three years and with a $&nbsp;1,250,000 
              (<i>7,5 million francs</i>) budget, the computerization of about 
              50,000 art items from all fields&nbsp: Fine arts, ethnology, natural 
              history, history, and society. 
            <p> <big>The web site project</big> 
            <p> As part of the project to digitize the collections of the museums 
              of the Nord-Pas de Calais region, approximately 15 museums, already 
              computerized, are taking part in the creation of a web site destined 
              for use by the general public.The second objective is to offer art 
              lovers and professionals everywhere a look at the riches of our 
              regional artistic heritage. 
            <p> The website was officially opened on December 17th 1997. 4,600 
              snapshots have been digitized and are ready to be catalogued and 
              tranferred to the database. Until the end of April 1998, the website 
              will be a beta-test version containing about 1000 records: 300 antique 
              photographs, 200 Oceanian items, 100 Dutch paintings, 100 Italian 
              paintings, 50 drawings, and 50 sculptures. 
            <p> <a target="_top" href="../http://www.irisi-nordpasdecalais.org/lettre27/art27_6.htm">http://www.irisi-nordpasdecalais.org/lettre27/art27_6.htm</a> 
            <p> <big>Themes</big> 
            <p> To undertake this gigantic project in an efficient and effective 
              way, priorities were set concerning the order in which the collections 
              were to be inventoried and digitized. The following fields have 
              been selected&nbsp: 
            <ul>
              <li>Ethnographic items from Oceania</li>
              <li>16th and 17th century Dutch and Flemish painting</li>
              <li>16th and 17th century italian painting</li>
              <li>17th to 19th century French painting</li>
              <li>19th and 20th century French sculpture.</li>
              <li>Wood painting of the 15th and 16th century Northern shools</li>
              <li>Antique photographic collections</li>
              <li>Laces</li>
              <li>etc...</li>
            </ul>
            <p> <big>Procedure</big> 
            <p> Each museum purchased the hardware and software of their choice, 
              but many of them chose «&nbsp;Micromusée&nbsp;&copy;» for PC from 
              MOBYDOC, while others chose «&nbsp;M3 Multi Média Muséums&nbsp;&copy;» 
              for Macintosh. Both software make it is possible to manage collections, 
              some versions manage images as well. Modern Art museums, however, 
              have a preference for «&nbsp;Vidéomuseum&nbsp;&copy;», a database 
              system connected to a videodisk. 
            <p> The first items selected had in most cases already been exhibited 
              or published and had therefore already been photographed. As for 
              the remaining items, several photographers are now working in the 
              museums and their reserves to photograph them. 
            <p> At the same time, an assistant researcher/documentalist will be 
              sent by the association in each museum in order to make an exhaustive 
              and precise list of the items that should be put into the documentary 
              data base according to the association's orders and choices. He/she 
              will also have to inform the photographer about the items he should 
              shoot in priority. 
            <p> Once this mini pre-inventory is done, he/she will have to perform 
              the following tasks under the museum's curator supervision&nbsp: 
              keyboard the museographic data into the museum information system 
              from the list he/she would have made out or check previous records 
              if those one have already been done. 
            <p> The documentalist then collects the snapshots and classifies them 
              in a folder with an exhaustive and orderly list of the corresponding 
              works. Every file is labeled by school of art, theme or by every 
              100 items (the maximum capacity of a Kodak photo CD) in the concern 
              of a good and ordered organization. The datas for each object are 
              then entered into the museum information system and a file in ASCII 
              format is created on a floppy. This diskette is included in the 
              loose-leaf file and the whole package is then sent to the Association. 
            <p> From there, the snapshots are sent to the digitazer in charge 
              of making the Kodak pictures CDs following the initial classification. 
              When the CDs are returned, the images are converted to JPEG & GIF 
              formats, checked and touched up: crop, gamma correction, brightness/contrast, 
              hue, saturation, luminance, RBG adjustments...etc. 
            <p> The very last step is simply to transfer via FTP the ASCII files 
              completed with an additional field containing the inventory number 
              of the Kodak photo CD ROM to the Internet accessible database located 
              at the University of Lille 1. 
            <p> And the work is done! 
            <p> This procedure may seem slow and behind the times considering 
              today's data base exchanges, high flow ATM links and multimedia 
              downloading, but one must not forget that not all of the museums 
              have computers (even if the major ones do), and that they are not 
              yet connected to digital communication networks such as Numéris 
              (ISDN). 
            <p> <big>Documentary files</big> 
            <p> At first, the idea was to go quickly. The museums inventories 
              are not yet completed and more involved documentary research would 
              have delayed the implementation of the data base. 
            <p> Each museum entry contains around twelve fields containing the 
              information destined for use by the general public. The MUSENOR 
              data base was conceived as a tool to bring together the collections 
              of the Nord-Pas de Calais and not as a scientific database, such 
              as JOCONDE. But the structure of MUSENOR allows for easy transfer 
              of data, making it possible to develop MUSENOR along the lines of 
              JOCONDE, if need be. 
            <p> Each data entry contains the following information: 
            <p> 
            <ol>
              <li>Title or reference</li>
              <li>Author or origin</li>
              <li>Date of the work or the acquisition</li>
              <li>The field or origin of the acquisition</li>
              <li>The material or technique used</li>
              <li>Measurements</li>
              <li>Location (which museum</li>
              <li>Inventory number</li>
              <li>A description or key words</li>
              <li>The name of the image document (jpeg)</li>

            <p> <big>The web interface</big> 
            <p> Let's go to see how it looks ! <a target="_top" href="../http://www.univ-lille1.fr/acmnpdc">http://www.univ-lille1.fr/acmnpdc</a> 
            <p> <big>A federative goal</big> 
            <p> The principal objective of the project was to create a documentary 
              data base which would include most if not all of the treasures of 
              the Nord-Pas de Calais museums. Very early on we discovered that 
              the difficulties were not technical, but organizational. 
            <p> Considering that the progress in information sciences is exponential, 
              there are more than enough tools to meet users' needs, but the organization 
              of the project was based on the following essential ingredients: 
            <p> 
            <ol>
              <li>The role of the museums: First and foremost, each museum must 
                be responsible for its own data entry, either by employing their 
                own documentalist or someone from the Association who will work 
                under the curators; 
                <p> 
              <li>On site work: Selecting and verifying the photographic reproductions 
                of items in the collection must be done on site by the documentalist, 
                with the assistance of the curator and perhaps the photographer. 
                <p> 
              <li>Standardization: each museum can do its own data entry as it 
                chooses, but there is an inherent need to standardize the entries 
                from the start to avoid random results when data queries are run. 
                To avoid problems, the categories chosen by the «&nbsp;Direction 
                des musées de France (DMF)&nbsp;» French Museums Administration 
                for its database, «&nbsp;Joconde&nbsp;», serve as an excellent 
                base from which to work. 
                <p> 
              <li>Evolution : it is unrealistic to think that the information 
                and documents available in a given museum are unchanging, they 
                are alive in a sense, they evolve and need constant updating. 
                In addition, recent advancements in search engines (by complete 
                text, natural language, idea, or meaning) must be integrated in 
                order to offer the user greater ease, power, and efficiency. 
            </ol>
            <p> <big>Problems and hurdles</big> 
            <p> When the process of computerizing the regional collections started 
              10 years ago, the systems used were still large and not geared for 
              use by the general public. Consequently, museum curators and researchers 
              were unable to use the tools and information available because they 
              lacked the necessary technical expertise. 
            <p> In addition to this, most museums are staffed by one curator, 
              a secretary and several guards; there is no archivist, no documentalist 
              and no computer expert. Most museums in France posses large collections 
              which are extremely versatile and varied, but most curators are 
              specialists in only one domain and most if not all are overwhelmed 
              with work. To ask them to use a complex computer system is nothing 
              short of ridiculous. 
            <p> The development of the personal computer revolutionized the computerization 
              of museums. Since the beginning of the 1980s, curators have been 
              able to take charge of documenting their collections, but they are 
              still overwhelmed with work. It is for this very reason that the 
              ACMNPDC has made its specialists (project manager, documentalists, 
              photographers, data processors) available to museums to help them 
              computerize their collections. One must bear in mind, however, that 
              this process can only be successful if the museum itself is supportive 
              of the work being done and if the staff cooperates with the specialists. 
            <p> Standards have therefore been established which allow for complete 
              and detailed information on each documented object. Each object 
              is unique, having its own registration number, being of a specific 
              material or technique, and having one or more anonymous or known 
              artist/creator. The established standards for JOCONDE must encompass 
              an enormous quantity of information and they are not necessarily 
              ideal. This is why we have chosen for MUSENOR to use the minimal 
              information necessary to describe an item. The standards themselves 
              are based on a rough consensus established by curators in a given 
              field of expertise. 
            <p> Consequently, the main difficulty encountered during this process 
              was to avoid changing the standards which had been used before the 
              development of computer processing. Experience has shown that to 
              neglect established standards in a situation such as this can lead 
              to a refusal on the part of the user to accept the new technologies. 
              The other cause of a rejection of computerization is that it tends 
              to bring to the fore existing organizational and managerial problems. 
              As a result, computer technology is often seen as a hindrance to 
              smooth and efficient working conditions, thus making it an arduous 
              task to respect established norms while taking advantage of the 
              possibilities which computer technology has to offer. 
            <p> The role of the ACMNPDC therefore is to help the staff from each 
              museum recognize the need for a regional collective catalogue. By 
              working within the established norms, curators will not only be 
              able to contribute to the MUSENOR database from their own local 
              computer systems, but will also be able to exchange information 
              directly from one museum to another. They will quickly discover 
              that they have access to a tool which can help in organizing exhibits 
              and in promoting their own collections. 
            <p> Advertising their collections translates to increased numbers 
              of visitors, which brings in more money. Making their collections 
              more accessible will also give educators new elements and tools 
              to reinforce their teaching, especially in the field of history. 
            <p> The ACMNPDC web site is still a baby but at least is taking its 
              first steps. Only long term efforts and patience will bring success. 
              As a matter of fact, it is no longer a question of simply being 
              on the web. In order to make up for being behind the times, we have 
              to hit the target right away, at every level&nbsp;: scientifically 
              rigorous, technical yet functional, ergonomic and easily navigated, 
              artistic yet useful, fun yet informative, graphically of the highest 
              quality...etc. 
            <p> <big>Conclusion</big> 
            <p> The use of computer technology in France (and in Europe in general, 
              with the exception of Great Britain and Scandinavia) remains rather 
              simplistic, used mostly for internal management and not as a way 
              to communicate with the client. Clearly, the time has come to rethink 
              the use of computer technology at a strategic level: the PC is no 
              longer that machine which we use to write letters and enter museum 
              information, it is a communications, marketing and representational 
              tool. 
            <p> The computerization of a museum should no longer be perceived 
              as an internal project. The museum must go beyond its walls to take 
              part in a global exchange and communication. While such projects 
              may be technically easy to implement, they are intellectually rewarding 
              and stimuating. 
            <p> The current has started to flow. We are working through the beginning 
              stages, but the most difficult task is yet to come: following the 
              growth pattern of the database -- a showplace for the artistic riches 
              of our region -- and its capacity to carry out horizontal and cooperative 
              projects. 
            <p> To conclude, I would like to stress the three-fold nature of our 
              work: indispensable, irreversible, and increasingly efficient : 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Indispensable because in the future, as stated by a speaker 
                at a November 1997 conference in Bonn, if you are not on the web 
                you simply don't exist 
                <p> 
              <li>Irreversible because now that we are on the web we have no choice 
                but to move forward; there is no going back. 
                <p> 
              <li>Increasingly efficient because a bit of time regularly and locally 
                given to the task of getting our museums on line can bring both 
                continual world-wide impact and visibility. 
            </ul>
            <p> Hoping that thanks to the multiplication of our efforts, this 
              famous French backwardness will be soon forgotten !
