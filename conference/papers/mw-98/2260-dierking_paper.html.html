          <h3>Understanding Free-Choice Learning: A Review of the Research and 
            its Application to Museum Web Sites</h3>
          <h4> <a href="../../bios/dierking.html">Lynn 
            D. Dierking, Ph.D.</a><br>

            Annapolis, MD 21401</h4>
          According to the USA Weekend web site on December 14, 1997, nearly 8,000 
          museum web pages existed, some representing actual museums around the 
          world and others existing solely in cyberspace. During a recent 'surf' 
          on the Net using one of the standard search engines, 144,232 museum-related 
          items were found. Although probably not all of these represent museum 
          web sites, a fraction of these would still be a large number. Even the 
          American Association of Museums now includes a special section on web 
          sites in its Official Museum Directory published each year. Museums 
          have met the Web!!!
          <p> What this means is that now daily as people explore the Web they 
            have the option of selecting a museum-oriented web site. The question 
            that we would like to raise and discuss in this paper is why would 
            someone choose to do so? In other words, do we know anything about 
            the potential expectations, interests and behaviors of these web users? 
            Is there any research that can guide developers as they attempt to 
            design effective web sites?
          <p> At first blush, the answer might seem no. Specific user research 
            in this area is very much in its infancy and, if done at all, is most 
            often formative in nature, focusing for example on whether the screen 
            will be user friendly or the instructions clear. However, if we step 
            back and attempt to put this activity into a larger context we see 
            that there is a large body of very pertinent literature, the literature 
            of free-choice learning.
          <p> Current research would suggest that people seem to learn under one 
            of two conditions: 1) when they have to learn (compulsory learning); 
            and 2) when they want to learn (free-choice learning; Falk and Dierking, 
            in preparation). Like many dichotomies, this one is not always clear 
            cut but by and large, it adequately separates learning experiences 
            into two groups. Free-choice learning is learning just for the sake 
            of learning, learning for fun, learning if and when the internal motivation 
            strikes. This is the type of learning that motivates someone to browse 
            a museum web site or read National Geographic Magazine, watch the 
            Discovery Channel or The History Channel or travel to foreign countries 
            to explore ancient cities, rain forests or coral reefs. It is the 
            type of learning that predominates most of daily life. People today 
            are finding it increasingly necessary and enjoyable to actively and 
            knowingly engage in such free-choice learning. Simply put, people 
            are more and more seeking out free-choice learning opportunities.
          <p> So what does the literature about free choice learning tell us about 
            the potential web user? Much of the research in this area has focused 
            on museum visitation and it is this research with which we are most 
            familiar. This literature documents why people go to museums, what 
            they do when they are there and what the long-term impacts of these 
            experiences might be (ASTC, 1994; Balling &amp; Cornell, 1985; Borun, 
            Cleghorn &amp; Garfield, 1995; Dierking &amp; Falk, 1994; Falk, 1988; 
            Falk, 1993; Falk &amp; Dierking, 1992; Falk, Balling, &amp; Liversidge, 
            1985; Graburn, 1984; Horn &amp; Finney, 1994; Kimche, 1978; Kimmel 
            &amp; Maves, 1972; Yellis, 1985). In addition, there is a growing 
            body of literature documenting the specific use of multimedia in museums 
            (Thomas &amp; Mintz, in press; Dierking &amp; Falk, in press). Although 
            the specific findings of these two areas of research may not apply 
            in all cases, there is much that is relevant.
          <p> Visiting museums and museum-like settings is one of the most popular 
            leisure time activities in America (Naisbitt &amp; Aburdene, 1990). 
            A recent American Association of Museums survey (American Association 
            of Museums, 1992) found that 565.8 million people visited U.S. museums 
            in 1988; averaging out to nearly two visits per year for every man, 
            woman and child in the country. Who are these visitors? Traditionally, 
            this question has been answered demographically, using variables such 
            as age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income and occupation. 
            Although these variables provide some insight into the profile of 
            a museum visitor, as suggested by Falk (1998), demographic variables 
            are unlikely to adequately describe, let alone predict, a behavior 
            as complex as museum-going. Instead, additional dimensions must be 
            considered, including psychographic variables such as leisure time 
            interests and preferences, personal history and value variables such 
            as early childhood experiences and attitudes towards learning and 
            education, and a range of environmental variables such as recommendations 
            from friends and family, cost, time and museum marketing. Taken together, 
            these demographic, psychographic, personal history and environmental 
            factors begin to reveal some interesting patterns and relationships 
            that relate to the complex behavior known as museum-going.
          <p> A variety of studies have utilized what are called psychographics, 
            psychological and motivational characteristics of individuals, to 
            understand museum-going. Individuals with similar demographics (age, 
            gender, race/ethnicity, education, income and occupation) can possess 
            very different psychographics. Hood (1983, 1993) has consistently 
            argued for the use of psychographics in addition to demographics in 
            the characterization of museum visitors. For example, it is now known 
            that museum-goers possess the following psychographic profile: they 
            value learning; seek out the challenge of exploring and discovering 
            new things; and place a high value on doing something worthwhile in 
            their leisure time (Hood, 1983, 1993; Falk, 1993; Horn &amp; Finney, 
            1994; Hushion, et. al., 1994). Such characteristics are shared by 
            a variety of people, including peoples of all race/ethnicities, incomes, 
            level of educational attainment, age and gender. Museum visiting can 
            be characterized as a more active, challenging leisure experience 
            than traditionally passive leisure pursuits such as television watching 
            or movie-going. Most of the Americans attending museums believe that 
            education is an important life-long process. They perceive that there 
            are few more interesting and important things to do in their leisure 
            time. They are also likely to perceive museums as places that afford 
            opportunities to expand their own and their children's learning horizons.
          <p> Personal history and values play a major role in museum-going as 
            well. On the whole, individuals who go to museums have explicitly 
            chosen to attend not because of some theoretical interest in learning, 
            but out of a concrete interest in a particular area or areas of learning, 
            whether science, history or art (Dierking &amp; Holland, 1994; Dierking, 
            Adams &amp; Spencer-Etienne, 1996; Falk, 1993; Falk &amp; Holland, 
            1994; Falk, Holland &amp; Dierking, 1992; Taylor, 1986). A disproportionate 
            number of museum-goers go to museums expressly for the benefit of 
            their children ( Falk, 1993; Rosenfeld, 1980; Taylor, 1986). We also 
            know that many American museum-goers share some common experiences 
            in childhood that appear to directly relate to museum-going (Falk, 
            1993).
          <p> Individuals interested in art go to art-oriented museums; individuals 
            interested in history go to history-oriented museums and individuals 
            interested in science go to science-oriented museums. For example, 
            well over 90% of visitors to science museums express a high to moderate 
            interest in science; the 10% who indicated a low interest claimed 
            to be visiting with someone with high interest (Falk, 1993). Although 
            there is overlap between audiences at various types of museums, most 
            art-lovers do not regularly attend science museums and plant fanciers 
            are not usually frequent zoo-goers. It is non-trivial that visitors 
            self-select an institution to visit because they perceive that it 
            will satisfy a basic and very personal need they have to learn more 
            about a particular subject area. Whereas most visitors profess high 
            to moderate interest in the subjects presented at the museum, the 
            same individuals profess only low to moderate knowledge (Dierking 
            &amp; Holland, 1994; Dierking, Adams &amp; Spencer-Etienne, 1996; 
            Falk, 1995; Falk &amp; Holland, 1994). However, it is important to 
            note that very few people go to museums to become experts. Rather, 
            museum-goers are interested, curious lay people, going to generally 
            improve their knowledge, not specifically improve their knowledge. 
            Museums are helpful environments in which to satisfy that desire for 
            personal exploration of the arts, history and/or sciences.
          <p> Transcending personal interests and values, much of any individual's 
            leisure behavior is influenced by early childhood experiences and 
            parental modeling (Kelly, 1974, 1977). From a variety of studies, 
            we now know that one of the most important determinants of adult free-choice 
            museum-going behavior is whether or not the adult went to museums 
            with their family as a child (Falk, 1993; Holzer, Scott &amp; Bixler, 
            1997; Kelly, 1977; Smith, Wolf &amp; Starodubtsev, 1994). In addition 
            to family behavior, other childhood leisure behaviors seem to be correlated 
            with adult museum-going. These behaviors include reading, taking family 
            trips and participating in clubs, associations or scouts. Although 
            none of these activities in and of themselves could be said to result 
            in museum-going, it seems that the type of individual who was likely 
            to read in their free time or participate as part of a club or scouts 
            is more likely than one who did not engage in such activities to grow 
            up into a museum-going adult. It also seems that parents who took 
            their children on trips, much as going to a museum, provided appropriate 
            role models for things to do with children, indirectly resulting in 
            an increased propensity to become an adult museum-goer.
          <p> Most visitors arrive at the museum with expectations about what 
            will actually occur (Falk &amp; Dierking, 1992; Falk, Holland &amp; 
            Dierking, 1992). Museum audiences, whether families, adult couples 
            or singles, agree on a few characteristics: 1) the best museum is 
            the one that presents a variety of interesting material that appeals 
            to different age groups, educational levels, personal interests and 
            technical levels; 2) whether visiting as a group or alone, visitors 
            expect to be mentally engaged in some way by what they see, in other 
            words, they expect to be able to personally connect in some way with 
            the objects, ideas and experiences presented and often expect to do 
            more than just look at things, perhaps even become physically engaged; 
            and, 3) people visiting in groups, either families with children or 
            all-adult groups, expect an opportunity for a shared experience, as 
            the members of the group with their varying interests and backgrounds 
            exchange and communicate their knowledge and excitement for what they 
            see and experience. In addition, there are also some built-in assumptions. 
            Paramount is the knowledge that this is the real stuff or about the 
            real stuff; consequently, visitors believe that there is an inherent 
            sense of integrity to the objects, ideas and experiences presented 
            within the museum (Falk &amp; Dierking, 1992; Shoup &amp; Associates, 
            1995).
          <p> Probing further and asking what makes a museum visit engaging, some 
            visitors refer to &quot;hands-on&quot; or &quot;touching&quot; experiences, 
            others indicate a desire for a human presence in the galleries to 
            respond to specific visitor questions and to provide explanations, 
            and many refer to the role that media can play in fostering interactivity, 
            particularly CD-ROMS and computer interactives. A universal theme 
            emerges from these descriptions: all reflect a reciprocal relationship 
            in which the visitor is given choices, makes choices, becomes involved 
            and ultimately is an active participant in the experience. This is 
            true whether the visitor is curious and asks a question of a facilitator 
            on the gallery floor, experiences something new by encountering or 
            touching an object for the first time or in a different way, or simply 
            chooses among options on a computer terminal.
          <p> Some visitors are very knowledgeable about specific aspects of the 
            museum collection; others are relatively uninformed. Some visitors, 
            even if lacking in subject matter knowledge, are curious about the 
            objects and ideas represented by the museum; some are not. Some visitors 
            are experienced museum-goers; some are not. Adult-only visitors share 
            many of these same expectations. Although adults' expectations are 
            frequently more subject-matter driven, they too are likely to have 
            social motivations (Adams, 1989; Dierking &amp; Falk, 1994; Falk, 
            1993; Falk, Holland &amp; Dierking, 1992; Horn &amp; Finney, 1994; 
            McManus, 1987). Families go disproportionately to science centers, 
            natural history museums, historical sites, children's museums, zoos 
            and aquaria. Adult-only visitors are disproportionately represented 
            among the public visiting art museums, historical homes, craft and 
            design museums, botanical gardens and arboreta. Schools bring children 
            on field trips to all these sites, but more heavily visit the institutions 
            included in the first (family) grouping.
          <p> As suggested earlier, the public does expect science museums to 
            generally provide information on science, contemporary art museums 
            to display contemporary art, historical sites to be about a specific 
            historical period, botanical gardens to include a wide variety and 
            assortment of plants, etc. Most visitors are not experts in these 
            subjects, but rather highly interested novices (Dierking &amp; Holland, 
            1994; Falk, 1995; Falk &amp; Holland, 1994; Falk, Holland &amp; Dierking, 
            1992). Accordingly, the public is seeking interesting, informative, 
            but non-technical exhibitions. In all cases, interesting and informative 
            are relative terms -- relative to the needs, background and prior 
            experiences of the visitor. Thus, there can be no absolute definition 
            of what is "interesting and informative."
          <p> Although much of what the museum visitor encounters is subject-specific 
            information related to science, history or art, as reviewed by Falk 
            and Dierking (1992), much is not. Visitors also have other less subject 
            matter-oriented expectations of the rich social, physical and personal 
            contexts museums afford. For example, various studies have documented 
            that beyond &quot;content,&quot; museums afford opportunities for 
            social interactions (cf. Dierking and Falk, 1994), for escaping from 
            the normal hum-drum of the work-a-day world (Graburn, 1977; Yellis, 
            1985) and for the experience of interesting and unusual built or natural 
            environments (Falk, 1988; Kimmel &amp; Maves, 1972). Visitors, particularly 
            to science museums and science centers, also increasingly expect to 
            encounter some type of multimedia experience at a museum. This could 
            be an IMAX film, a computer interactive, or a video disc; the particular 
            media is not the issue as much as the fact that such experiences are 
            increasingly an expected option for museum visitors. Visitors appreciate 
            the use of multimedia, recognizing that computers, CD-ROMs and other 
            technologies can provide both varying degrees of depth of information, 
            as well as options that facilitate visitor flexibility and choice 
            (Shoup &amp; Associates, 1995).
          <p> What does the audience research reveal about the use of media in 
            museums? Probably the one major generalization is that media use is 
            highly self-selected. In a number of studies that we and others have 
            conducted, not all visitors have interacted with all of the media 
            elements in any exhibition, in the same way that few visitors read 
            all the labels or look at all of the objects in an exhibition either. 
            For example, during a study of a decorative arts exhibition at Winterthur, 
            in which many visitors were enthusiastic about the computer interactives, 
            there were also a number of visitors who expressed no interest in 
            using the interactives at all or only interacted with them minimally 
            even though they were designed to enhance visitors' ability to look 
            at the objects nearby (Dierking &amp; Harper, 1995; Dierking &amp; 
            Marcum, 1994). Typical responses by this group were: &quot;I would 
            rather spend my time looking at the objects themselves.&quot; and 
            &quot;I work with computers all week and so when I come to a museum 
            I don't choose to do so.&quot;
          <p> Similar results were observed at several science centers as part 
            of a series of studies of the computer interactives in the AIDS traveling 
            exhibition &quot;What About AIDS?&quot; (Falk &amp; Holland, 1992; 
            Falk &amp; Holland, 1993; Holland &amp; Falk, 1995), of a film and 
            videodisc in the Spirit of the Motherland exhibition at the Virginia 
            Museum of Fine Arts (Dierking &amp; Spencer-Etienne, 1995; Dierking, 
            Adams &amp; Spencer-Etienne, 1996), of films in the American Encounters 
            exhibition at the National Museum of American History (Falk &amp; 
            Holland, 1994) and of films and video loops in the Liberation, 1945 
            exhibition at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum (Dierking, Falk &amp; 
            Abrams, 1996). These are very different institutions, yet very similar 
            results were observed. It is important to note, of course, that in 
            each of these studies there were also a number of visitors that spent 
            a great deal of quality time interacting with the media elements. 
            These results support the notion that media is an important option 
            for some visitors.
          <p> Are media users different from non-media users? Media users tend 
            to be younger visitors, children and youth, often those visitors who 
            feel comfortable with media, especially when one is considering visitor 
            use of such media as computer interactives and videodiscs. Gender 
            is an interesting factor also when considering media use. Only a limited 
            number of studies have investigated the relationship between media 
            use and gender in the museum setting. In one study, more males were 
            direct users of the computer, but both genders were equally represented 
            as indirect users (Pawlukiewicz, Bohling &amp; Doering, 1989). In 
            another study utilizing touch screen computers as an orientation device, 
            65% of the users were males (Sharpe, 1983). In a 1991 study by Morrissey, 
            investigating an interactive videodisc in a special exhibit on birds, 
            groups with boys were twice as likely to use the program as groups 
            with girls, although the results were more equivocal when adults were 
            in the group (Morrissey, 1991). In a formative evaluation of a computer 
            interactive for the &quot;How Things Fly&quot; gallery we conducted 
            at the National Air &amp; Space Museum (Abrams &amp; Dierking, 1996), 
            71% of the self-selected sample were males, while in a summative evaluation 
            of an interactive videodisc in the Spirit of the Motherland exhibition 
            at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, users were more prevalently female 
            (Dierking, Adams &amp; Spencer-Etienne, 1996). Obviously gender is 
            not a straightforward variable when it comes to media use.
          <p> While conducting a remedial evaluation of the National Gallery of 
            Art's Micro Gallery, a separate gallery area on the first floor of 
            the West Wing designed to provide videodisc access and more in-depth 
            information about the Gallery's collection, we tried to determine 
            how many people used the Micro Gallery and whether they were representative 
            of the usual visitors to the National Gallery. Results suggested that 
            there was a great deal of self-selection going on at the entrance 
            of the gallery in terms of who entered the Micro Gallery once at the 
            museum and who did not. For the most part, the visitors to the Micro 
            Gallery were relatively representative of other gallery visitors, 
            the main difference relating to their level of ease with technology 
            or their interest in delving in more detail into aspects of the National 
            Gallery's collection via a videodisc (Adams &amp; Abrams, 1995). In 
            the course of observing and interviewing over 100 visitors, there 
            were only a few visitors that expressly had visited the museum that 
            day to visit the Micro Gallery.
          <p> This study, as well as the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and Winterthur 
            studies, also provide data that reduces, if not eliminates, a major 
            concern that many skeptical museum professionals have about the use 
            of media by visitors in exhibitions. There is no evidence that visitors 
            choose to use a media element rather than look at objects and read 
            labels in an exhibition. In fact, there is some modest evidence suggesting 
            that some of these media presentations, such as the Micro Gallery 
            at the National Gallery of Art, the Spirit of the Motherland videodisc 
            and the Experience Africa film at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts 
            and the connoisseurship interactives at the Winterthur, actually served 
            as resources and incentives for visitors to look at objects again 
            or in more depth after engaging in the media experience. The media 
            presentation alone was not the museum experience for visitors; they 
            had come expecting to look at and examine objects and/or phenomena 
            and they did so.
          <p> In the minds of visitors, what are some of the pros and cons of 
            media use in museums? Obviously, visitors are interested in the fact 
            that media can increase their options and choices, particularly when 
            considering media such as computers and videodiscs. They recognize 
            that in many cases technology is the solution to becoming more interactive, 
            especially for museums wishing to serve children and youth. They recognize 
            that computers and CD-ROM technology can provide choices in terms 
            of the depth of information presented, as well as what is presented 
            and, in many cases, how it is presented. Visitors have concerns about 
            technology also. They would like media options in museums to be more 
            &quot;user-friendly,&quot; assisting them in knowing what options 
            are available and once the appropriate choice of interest has been 
            made, they want to be able to successfully experience the option.
          <p> What insights does this literature offer for those designing museum 
            web sites? As we suggested, we do not know how much of this research 
            is directly relevant--it is unclear at this stage how much of an overlap 
            exists between the museum visitor and the potential museum web user. 
            Our sense is that there is some overlap, particularly when it comes 
            to the psychographic profiles and expectations of these individuals, 
            but quite honestly we don't know. Beyond the specifics presented here, 
            however, what probably is an important take-away message is how important 
            it is to understand the profiles of your potential users in order 
            to create a web experience that is meaningful to them and to recognize 
            that most likely web use is as complex a behavior as museum-going.
          <p> It goes without saying also, but it is critical to insure that the 
            integrity and quality of what is presented in a museum still is present 
            in the web site. As we suggested earlier, visitors do assume that 
            there is an inherent integrity to the objects, ideas and experiences 
            presented within the museum and most probably extend those expectations 
            to a museum web site so there is an obligation to uphold. Remember, 
            visitors have freely chosen to visit your web site, consequently you 
            want to be sure to use the media well, exercising the same high standards 
            of integrity that you would in any of your endeavors.
          <p> This integrity includes communication integrity. One can have created 
            the most wonderful web site in the world but if users do not know 
            it is available, understand how to use it effectively, or make sense 
            of the content presented, all that effort has been wasted. Whenever 
            possible, front-end testing of concepts and formative testing of interfaces 
            should be conducted with users during the development of the web site. 
            This testing can be modest but ensures that there has been some effort 
            to determine whether concepts, directions and graphics communicate 
            well and clearly to potential users.
          <p> There is also a great need for specific research to understand the 
            role that the Internet and web use is playing in people's lives and 
            the potential it has for interpreting museum objects, phenomena and 
            associated ideas to users. As we suggested, much of the free-choice 
            learning research has focused on museum visitation. Very little research 
            on free choice learning has focused on who is drawn to the Internet 
            or the role that the Internet and museum web sites can play in communicating 
            ideas; studies of this nature would be exceedingly useful as a guide 
            for this burgeoning activity. Potential interesting questions might 
            be: Are their particular types of ideas that lend themselves to web 
            site presentations? Is there a profile of a &quot;typical&quot; web 
            user? And What types of web experiences support user learning? It 
            would seem that there is tremendous potential in this media to extend 
            the museum experiences of current visitors and to potentially attract 
            new users. The Internet promises to be the ultimate tool of the Learning 
            Society, if we can learn how best to harness its potential. As we 
            begin to develop a better body of knowledge about the interpretive 
            role of a museum web site, we will be in a much better position to 
            wisely use this media to support positive user experiences.
