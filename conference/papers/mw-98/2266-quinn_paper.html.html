            <h3>Why are we Here?</h3>
            <h4><a href="../../bios/quinn.html">Cliff 
              Quinn</a>, British Columbia Museums Association</h4>
            Why <b>are</b> museums and galleries and other cultural organizations 
            on the Internet? And doing it with such enthusiasm!</P> 
            <p>In British Columbia, extrapolating from the 300 museums that we 
              know have computers, and suggest that in the past 5 years all of 
              them have bought at least $2,500 worth of equipment, we arrive at 
              a figure of $750,000 worth of computer equipment. At least 150 of 
              these institutions have paid for Internet accounts for at least 
              2 years, adding another $75,000 to the total. Even a modest investment 
              in staff time learning software and creating and maintaining Web 
              sites runs the total well over $1,000,000.</p>
            <p>In business, company managers look for the ROI (Return on Investment) 
              and look at the COA (Cost of Ownership) for capital equipment such 
              as computers and for dedicating people to a task. Is it possible 
              for museums to look at their investment the same way?</p>
            <h2>The REAL Question</h2>
            <p>Questioning the value of computerization, the Internet, or the 
              WWW raises a host of other questions about evaluation of museums’ 
              performance. Stephen Weil, Emeritus Senior Scholar at the Smithsonian 
              Institution in Washington, DC, <a href="../http://www.museumsassn.bc.ca/~bcma/museums/bcma/Conferences/97/keynote.html" target="_top">speaking 
              at the BC Museums Association conference</a> in Prince George in 
              October 1997 asked, "What are the OUTCOMES that we want to achieve?" 
              Knowing these outcomes makes measuring the results easier. This 
              is just as true for the Web Site as for the museum as a whole.</p>
            <p>So the question becomes "What are we trying to achieve, and how 
              successfully are we achieving it?"</p>

            <h2>Starting to Look for Answers</h2>
            <p>With the objective of trying to define an appropriate model for 
              museums to follow, and rationale for investment of their resources 
              in this new medium, the BC Museums Association undertook a <a href="../http://www.museumsassn.bc.ca/~bcma/report.html" target="_top">survey 
              in 1996</a> funded by the Canada-BC Agreement on Culture and Communications.</p>
            <p>While this was not a particularly encouraging perspective, it did 
              nothing to discourage museums from continuing to invest. We all 
              ride on the crest of the marketing wave perpetuated by the Wintel 
              monopolies, <i>and</i> we tend to truly believe in and want a new 
              communications medium to put us in touch with our peers and our 
              audiences.</p>
            <h3>Rationalizing our Participation: What are we doing wrong?</h3>
            <p>William Sheridan writing in the February 13, 1998 <i>Computerworld 
              Canada</i> quotes Paul Strassman as saying that "computers without 
              an effective business strategy are worth no more than the scrap 
              value of their plastic, metal and glass." If this is true of museums, 
              it is an unfortunate place to put the $2,500 that the local museum 
              has struggled to extract from local government, donors or casinos. 
              He suggests however that "knowledge is still a more important investment 
              than technology; computers can only be justified by the value they 
              add to a business.<a name="1">"</a><a href="footnotes.html#1">1</a></p>
            <p>The Internet is a still more nebulous investment. The 1996 BCMA 
              survey found no institution that could point to significant benefits 
              derived from investment in the World Wide Web. People pointed to 
              a change in work methods, and that the Web facilitated this. There 
              was however no evidence that these changes actually benefited the 
              institutions making the investment, or changed the way they behaved. 
              "If you modernize the technology, but you don’t modernize the business 
              process, the technology is just a wasted investment. If you are 
              not going to buy into the behaviour, don’t waste your money on machines."</p>
            <p>As in the business world, it appears that "The Web was never integrated 
              well, or in many cases at all, into corporate strategies." This 
              may point out that many cultural institutions don’t have corporate 
              strategies, or that Directors and Boards not take their business 
              plans into consideration when making decisions about computers and 
              the Internet.</p>
            <p>One of the great potential values of the web is to assist us in 
              evaluating our products and services. Businesses are encouraged 
              to use the net as "a fourth channel for having an <i>interactive</i> 
              conversation with customers, while still retaining the first three: 
              face-to-face, mail and phone.<a name="2">"</a><a href="footnotes.html#2">2</a> 
              If we focus on the interactive elements of the Web, we can start 
              to see some of the incredible potential it holds.</p>
            <p>All of these "channels" must however be synchronized, pointing 
              out some of our failings, and those of many organizations on the 
              web. Their public face does not reflect well on the institution. 
              They don’t take the medium seriously, thought they are investing 
              serious amounts of resources.</p>
            <h3>Commerce on the Net: the great attractor</h3>
            <p>Beware of holding out high hopes for commercial success on the 
              Internet. While it is becoming increasingly common, and easy to 
              do, there are indications that a "skeptical and cautious" browsing 
              public does not readily accept it. The University of Michigan’s 
              <a href="hermes.html">Hermes project</a> <a name="hermes">provides</a> 
              some fascinating and useful insights into commercial uses of the 
              Web.</p>
            <p>Every little bit helps though, and perhaps the very obscurity of 
              most of our marvelous commodities makes them good targets for Web 
              sales<a name="3">.</a><a href="footnotes.html#3">3</a></p>
            <h2>Current Models</h2>
            <p>Good insights can perhaps be obtained from looking at the range 
              of web sites now produced by museums, and trying to determine why 
              they have been produced. Though this is not always clear from the 
              site, there must have been originally a reason for the creation 
              of the web site. Following might be some of the groups we might 
              use:</p>
            <h3>A "Presence"</h3>
            <p>The fear of being left behind in the electronic world prompts many 
              museums to either create, or accept the offer of a "free web page" 
              from a local provider. Often the motivation is not thought out, 
              and there may be hopes of marketing value. These web pages are often 
              the equivalent to (or less than) an electronic brochure, presenting 
              the most basic museum information. On the positive side, such a 
              page is usually part of another institution’s information, making 
              the museum part of a community (municipality, local ISP, provincial 
              association).</p>
            <h3>Fulfilling Mandate</h3>
            <h4>Program Delivery</h4>
            <p>Museum mandate includes community outreach, and at the minimum 
              level, pages may be used for announcement of public events, courses. 
              At a higher level, it is also possible to give courses, provide 
              training, though very few insitutions are attempting this at present.</p>
            <h4>Presentation of Collection</h4>
            <p>Web databases can be used to present the collection, or be included 
              in virtual exhibits<a name="4">.</a><a href="footnotes.html#4">4</a></p>
            <h4>Facilitation of Public Interaction</h4>
            <p>The Internet can facilitate many functions that require staff interaction 
              and Web sites. Membership renewals, course registrations, ordering 
              photographs, answering queries are examples.</p>
            <h3>Marketing</h3>
            <p>The museum itself, in a successful site can achieve greater popularity 
              and visitorship. This can be an end in itself, but often is as a 
              result of other successful componenets of the site.</p>
            <h3>Interactive Communication</h3>
            <p>A truly two-way site, gathering and providing information can be 
              a truly new and awesome communication tool. The implicit problem 
              here is that you are <i>adding</i> another communication medium 
              to the existing tool set of the museum, and this requires dedicated 
              resource time; computers, Internet connections and people all be 
              committed to this task. Once the expectation has been raised that 
              this will be an important access point to the museum, it must be 
              kept open and current.</p>
            <h3>Management and Evaluation</h3>
            <p>The WWW provides the important capability to feed information back 
              to management about preferences and popularity of different facets 
              of the museum’s presentation. In effect it is an on-going and current 
              survey of the electronic public. New </p>
            <h3>Internal Information (Intranet)</h3>
            <p>Run locally, a Web site can become and important access point for 
              staff to find museum information. Since museums often make use of 
              temporary staff, questions about programming, facilities, collections 
              and other resources can be presented in a coherent fashion. In effect 
              the site can be a procedures and information manual for staff.</p>
            <h3>Education and Programming</h3>
            <p>Information on the web site can be tailored to specific audiences, 
              and one of the most important is the educators in the community. 
              Focus this year at the BC Museums Association will be on creating 
              guidelines for museums’ interaction with their communities, suggesting 
              exhibit format, and content presentation that will link closely 
              with the curriculum at appropriate grade levels. While neither school 
              nor museum technologies can be relied on currently (many schools 
              have only one computer on the Internet) web sites could be important 
              delivery and communication tools between museum educators and school 
              staff.</p>
            <h2>Suggestions</h2>
            <h3>Designing Your Site</h3>
            <p>"Give away something valuable, (information, software, advice, 
              humor) and people will flock to your site. Original content is the 
              most important trait of a great Web site." (What Makes a Great Web 
              Site, <a href="../http://www.webreference.com/greatsite.html" target="_top">http://www.webreference.com/greatsite.html</a>).</p>
            <p>Building a site involves focusing on both the audience’s and the 
              institution’s needs. <a href="process.html">John December's</a> 
              <a name="process">evaluation</a> is that there are six steps in 
              this design process: Planning, Analysis, Desgin, Implementation, 
              Promotion and Innovation. 
            <h3>Evaluate and Update</h3>
            <p>While this is part of the process mentioned in the creation of 
              the site, it is too often overlooked, once the site is in place 
              and functioning. You objective must be to get people to return to 
              the site over and over again. It must become a useful tool, one 
              of their most-used bookmarks. So continually evaluate how your site 
              is being used, and always be adding some new treat for people to 
              explore.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>A new model for cultural and heritage institutions suggests that 
              cultural organizations are businesses; businesses that operate on 
              only a slightly different model than that of the for-profit organizations 
              that we often admire. We offer products and services, and are in 
              turn remunerated (usually) for them. It is frequently unclear how 
              that remuneration takes place, and unfortunately, as frequently 
              unclear what our products or services are. Knowing our products 
              will enable us to promote them, and to ask for appropriate remuneration, 
              whether in the form of fees, grants or other services.</p>
            <p><a href="../http://www.museumsassn.bc.ca/~bcma/museums/bcma/Conferences/97/keynote.html" target="_top">Steven 
              Weil</a> pointed out that we are very poor at evaluating how our 
              product is received, how well we are performing, whether we are 
              achieving our goals. Knowing the goals will faciliate this evaluation, 
              whether of the institution, or its Web site. With this in mind, 
              a serious, professional approach to Web site design will produce 
              a tool that will be of value to the institution and reflect proudly 
              the community’s heritage.</p>
