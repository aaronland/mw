          <h3>Collaboration and Student Involvement on an Art Curriculum Website<br>
            www.walkerart.org/artsnetmn/</h3>
          <h4><a href="../../bios/bridges.html">Barbara 
            Rogers Bridges, Ph.D.</a>, ArtsNet Minnesota Coordinator, Walker Art 
            Center, Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Frederick R.Weisman 
            Art Museum. Bemidji State University, professor Professional Studies, 
            art education.</h4>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          Turn of the millennium teachers are facing the most dramatic paradigm 
          shift to emerge within the educational community in the last several 
          centuries. Both teachers and students must become webslingers, like 
          Spiderman; enter a chaotic realm, anarchy; merge onto the super highway, 
          the no speed limit Autobahn; and willingly embrace a new learning model 
          which may prove to be exhilarating and frustrating, challenging and 
          rewarding. The Internet is like Mardi Gras - anything can happen and 
          no one is in charge.
          <p> Blandin Foundation of Minnesota expressed interest in developing 
            a curriculum site in order to connect rural Minnesota with the metropolitan 
            Minneapolis, St. Paul area, and with each other. They selected five 
            rural sites (arts organizations, college media center and Service 
            Cooperatives). I was hired to identify art teacher, student, museum 
            and arts organization desires, needs and expectations. By the spring 
            of 1997, the site was constructed by all participants. We launched 
            ArtsNet Minnesota in September of 1997. I gathered the original pilot 
            group through Satellite Site promotions, workshops on site, and my 
            college, K-12 and residency contacts. We continue to build our virtual 
            community with student’s use of our site as our present focus. With 
            a recent MCI grant, the summer of 1998 will bring continued expansion 
            of our curriculum. 
          <p> I earned my doctorate and embraced technology during the same time 
            period. I flew, I crashed; I was in awe of the volume of accessible 
            knowledge and I short circuited from the sheer number of variables 
            in the equation. The entire journey made me feel ignorant, not a pleasant 
            experience, considering I had just collected a doctorate! Using this 
            personal experience as valuable data, the ArtsNet Minnesota project 
            was approached with a clear understanding of problematic issues faced 
            by educators interested in exploring the new learning model created 
            by the Internet. In the spirit of collaboration, I hope this report 
            may be useful in your quest to broaden constituency based accessibility 
            to curriculum and art via the Internet (<a href="#eisner" name="eisnerfoot">Eisner</a>, 
            1991).
          <p> This paper will describe the emerging design issues revealed in 
            the pre-study data, the resulting design of ArtsNet Minnesota at launch, 
            a short summary of the 6 month study results, student involvement, 
            discussion and next phase priorities.
          <p> 
          <h3>Research Methods and Techniques:</h3>
          I am a multimethodological researcher. I believe "truth" is best revealed 
          by using empirical/ analytical, symbolic/interpretive, and critical 
          data collection techniques (<a href="#solomon" name="solomonfoot">Soloman</a>, 
          1991; <a href="#leedy" name="leedyfoot">Leedy</a>, 1993; <a href="#cohen" name="cohenfoot">Cohen 
          & Manion</a>, 1994 ). I used the Glaser and Strauss (1967) grounded 
          theory instrument development approach and employed the following: 
          <ol>
            <li>Review of literature and existing web sites. 
            <li>Interviews: (a) Personal (native collaborators) and (b) group. 
            <li>Verbal and written survey of workshop participants. What are the 
              ArtsNet Minnesota participants' expectations? Frustrations? Needs? 
              Dreams? 
            <li>Assessment of daily Internet listserv interaction; identification 
              of emerging trends. 
            <li>Assessment of teacher lesson contributions, participation totals, 
              online surveys, and phone conferences; identification of emerging 
              trends. 
          </ol>

          <h3>Emerging Design Issues Synthesized from the Literature</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Graphics heavy sites are often a slow download (<a href="#borland" name="borlandfoot">Borland</a>, 
              1997). 
            <li>An understanding for the necessity of (<a href="#gail" name="gailfoot">Gailbraith</a>, 
              1997), but an apprehension of, the emergent technology learning 
              models. 
            <li>Static HTML design. 
            <li>Need for support group - feeling of isolationism (May, 1994). 
            <li>Text not written in accessible language. This phenomena is described 
              as the often intimidating "Unassailable Voice" by <a href="#walsh" name="walshfoot">Walsh</a> 
              (1997). Text cannot be used "as is" for student, classroom generalist 
              and community access. This reinforces the "elite" imageprojected 
              by many museums (<a href="#donovan" name="donovanfoot">Donovan</a>, 
              1997; <a href="#witcomb" name="witcombfoot">Witcomb</a>, 1997). 
            <li>Site designs may be too time consuming for teachers to locate 
              specific resources quickly. Time is a MAJOR issue for many teachers 
              (<a href="#borland">Borland</a>, 1997). 
            <li>Lesson plans were too lengthy and scholarly.(<a href="#keifer" name="keiferfoot">Keifer-Boyd</a>, 
              1996). 
            <li>Lack of an embedded human resource on web sites was identified 
              by workshop participants as frustrating. 
            <li>Lack of specific events encouraging "real time" visits to the 
              museums. 
          </ul>
          <h3>ArtsNet Minnesota Design at Launch- September 1997</h3>
          Thirty six art works were selected from the three institutions. The 
          inquiry based site design is non-linear and includes sections titled 
          "About the Artist", and "About the Art", discussion questions (aesthetics, 
          criticism and interdisciplinary) and vocabulary, all written in student 
          language with convenient print capability. There is a separate link 
          focusing on short multicultural and interdisciplinary lesson Activities, 
          identified and indexed by discipline - science, language arts, art, 
          math etc. Multiple indices also enable the user to search for information 
          by theme (Environment, Identity, Inner Worlds and "What is Art?"), artwork, 
          artist and media. Teacher written Lesson Plans illustrated using Minnesota 
          students' artworks, a New News link and a Styles Characteristics chart 
          and glossary are also included on the site. The ArtsNet Minnesota website 
          design also includes an embedded list serve moderated by Dr. Barbara 
          Bridges, who is available for general conversation, to answer questions, 
          and to receive news and curriculum postings, etc. 
          <p> Three regional workshops demonstrating ArtsNet Minnesota and providing 
            an opportunity to meet the listserv moderator were conducted by Louis 
            Mazza, New Media Designer at the Walker Art Center and myself in August 
            and September 1997. Approximately one hundred people attended, most 
            were new to technology. Louis is a frequent voice on the listserv 
            and many participants have told me that meeting Louis and myself was 
            instrumental in encouraging them to make the first step into the often 
            intimidating world of technology. 
          <p> ArtsNet Minnesota attempted to construct itself in the "Outstanding 
            Learning Museum" model as described by <a href="#mcken" name="mckenfoot">McKenzie</a> 
            (1997). The site is an authentic multi-way conversation and curriculual 
            resource exchange, the who, where, when, how and why described by 
            <a href="#donovan">Donovan</a> (1997), <a href="#fernstrom" name="fernstromfoot">Fernstrom 
            & Bannon</a> (1997) and <a href="#anderson" name="andersonfoot">Anderson</a> 
            (1995). The design of the website has created an opportunity for participants 
            to take ownership of the ArtsNet Minnesota online arts resource. 
          <p> 
          <h3>Study Results September 1997 - February 1998</h3>
          As of February 15, 1998, we have approximately 65 participants on the 
          ArtsNet Minnesota listserv. The participants represent Minnesota state 
          visual arts and theater organizations, museum staff, art and classroom 
          generalist teachers, students and community members. We are not automatically 
          recording the number of visits, user demographics or viewing patterns. 
          The literature indicated this method to be ineffectual (<a href="#borland">Borland</a>, 
          1997). Instead, qualatative data and statistics describing specific 
          interest topic percentages, numbers of postings, areas of interest etc 
          were tallied using the multimethodological techniques described previously.
          <p> Over 900 postings on our ArtsNet Minnesota listserv were recorded 
            between participants or between participants and myself from September 
            20, 1997 to February, 1998. There were also over 150 phone calls recorded 
            during this time. Many participants were new to technology and needed 
            help signing up for the listserv or using their browser. e.g. I still 
            give directions at least once a week on how to select "All" to post 
            to the entire listserv. 
          <p> <br>
            Topic percentages follow: <br>

          <p> Many of our participants are new to technology and are uncomfortable 
            posting to the listserv. They read a general posting and then respond 
            to me directly. The human resource has been an important component 
            to the general development and usage of our site. 
          <p> 
          <h3>Student Involvement</h3>
          Student involvement emerged as the number one priority for the next 
          phase of ArtsNet Minnesota development. We create wonderful curriculum 
          websites, but do students and teachers use them? In June 1997, the participants 
          and partners decided that a constituency developed Student Link, connected 
          to a specific art work, would be the next project. The students, directed 
          by their art teachers, would "form a relationship with an artpiece" 
          (<a href="#mil" name="milfoot">Milekic</a>, 1997 p.271) and be encouraged 
          to transcend their own cultural perspective as they ask the who, when, 
          where and what questions (<a href="#lopez" name="lopezfoot">Lopez</a>, 
          1995).Participants were recruited for this activity using 1-6 phone 
          contacts, 3-5 e-mail contacts and 2-3 snail mail contacts. 
          <p> On April 17 we will conduct a major event for the ArtsNet Minnesota 
            participants. Fifty students from grades 3-12 representing all parts 
            of the state will select an artwork from the site and develop a student 
            page link. They will bring the images and text to an all day technology 
            workshop, conducted at the University of Minnesota by Louis Mazza, 
            Paulette Jones and Barbara Bridges, where they will learn the basic 
            elements and principles of design, HTML coding and how their weblink 
            will be constructed. While the students are at their workshop, the 
            sponsoring teachers (who may be meeting online friends for the first 
            time) will take a customized all-day tour of the Minneapolis Institute 
            of Arts, the Walker Art Center, and the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum. 
            All April 17th conference attendees must be participating on the listserv. 
            We disseminate information and share plans etc. online. 
          <p> 
          <h3>Teacher Responsibilities for the April 17th ArtsNet Minnesota Participant 
            Conference: </h3>
          A. Select 1-3 students. Identify them by name, age, and previous technical 
          experience. Work with students as they choose a work of art posted on 
          the ArtsNet Minnesota website. Students may work alone or in a group. 
          <p> B. Write and submit to Barbara, a one-paragraph description of the 
            journey that brought you to the ArtsNet Minnesota project (people 
            contacts,interest in technology,discipline isolation, Internet experience, 
            interest in learning about web and/or web design, mentoring students, 
            etc. Please include background and special area of interest). 
          <p> 
          <h3>Student Responsibilities for April 17th ArtsNet Minnesota Participant 
            Conference:</h3>
          A. The students will investigate their chosen work of art, the background 
          and the artist, etc. They will expand their investigation using other 
          resources. Make sure they review other websites! 
          <p> B. The students will develop an idea for a 2-3 page link responding 
            to the selected work. Their link will appear on the same level as 
            Teacher Lesson, Artist, Art, Activities, etc. Their development might 
            be prose or poetry, it could be a comparison to similar (or different) 
            art and artists. It could be student generated visual art, a quiz, 
            a postmodern puzzle or a response not imagined by us! One group has 
            animated characters from a work and will develop a short action sequence 
            with a moral message. Others may choose a more traditional approach. 
            Let the students develop the page(s) in the direction their creative 
            impulse and skills take them. 
          <p> C. The students will write a paragraph describing their chosen artwork 
            and the general approach or idea they plan for their link.

          <h3>Teacher Journeys and Student Plans</h3>
          <h4>Teacher Journeys </h4>
          <blockquote><b>Lindberg Elementary School</b>
            <p> "Who would have guessed that I would be traveling down the "cyber 
              hiway" with three third grade students (who, by the way, know alot 
              more about the computer). My connection with ArtsNet Minnesota is 
              directly related to my friend and colleague, Dr.Barbara Bridges 
              who I met through our affiliation with the Minnesota DBAE Consortium. 
              I teach visual Art to 720 K-12 students at Charles Lindbergh ElementarySchool 
              in Little Falls, Minnesota. I know you haven't heard my voice online 
              very much, class load and very few prep periods leave very little 
              time for conversation, but I love reading everything!" 
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote> <b>Plymouth Middle School</b>
            <p> "Re: My Interest in Technology/Computers. Since my introduction 
              of Internet I have been fascinated with the amount of information 
              and resources available through the world wide web. Kids are very 
              interested in it too, so it seems a logical connection in order 
              to make to involve them in the art class in another way. 
            <p> Typically, only one art teacher is assigned to a building. This 
              network makes a wonderful forum to learn, ask questions, find ideas, 
              and just feel like you are not the only one with the challenges 
              you are facing. This group seems accessible both in terms of common 
              interests, geography and a reasonable number of messages. I would 
              really like to learn more about web home page design to highlight 
              our school's program".
          </blockquote>
          <h4>Student Plans</h4>
          <blockquote><strong>Sartell Middle School</strong>
            <p> "I am going to compare and contrast the difference between Rauschenberg's 
              abstract expressionism and Marsden Hartley's realism. I will portray 
              this by making the two artworks have a conversation about which 
              one is really good art and why they are a superior artwork to the 
              other"
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote><strong>Annandale High School</strong>
            <p> "We are going to write a poem about the painting "Through Birds, 
              through fire,but Not through Glass," by Yves Tanguy expressing the 
              emotions we feel as we observe the painting. In our poem, we will 
              explore how this poem correlates to the teenage life and create 
              an image that people will be able to relate to. Along with this 
              idea, we will create icons that will link the viewer to other paintings 
              and images that express similar emotions. We hope that this set-up 
              will force the viewer to look deep into their own soul and feel 
              what the painter was feeling at the time. We also had an additional 
              idea of adding other students thoughts of the painting. We thought 
              we would get a quote from people about their feelings of the painting. 
              We would then take a picture of them and place their quote by their 
              picture. 
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Discussion and Summary </h3>
          Several design features presented on the ArtsNet Minnesota site have 
          received special a attention. The teachers have raved about the Styles 
          Characteristics chart. As we found when we constructed the chart, this 
          is a problematic area for a consensus and the teachers really appreciated 
          an updated list from the experts (museums). The multiple indexing (content 
          may be accessed by theme, artist, artwork, discipline or media), embedded 
          vocabulary, and student/classroom generalist and community friendly 
          text have also been mentioned as particularly attractive features. We 
          have moved from the aristocratic Jeffersonian model to the democratic 
          Jacksonian model (<a href="#levi" name="levifoot">Levi Smith</a>, 1991). 
          <p> Collaboration emerges as the key word for ArtsNet Minnesota's success 
            as an online Learning Museum. Every participant brought a valuable 
            skill to the party. For example, I am not a technology specialist. 
            I contributed experience as a curriculum writer, as did Laura Pereira 
            from the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and Susan Rotilie from the 
            Weisman Art Museum. I also brought the perspective of a university 
            professor, art teacher and artist. I was hired coordinate the development 
            of the project and to act as listserv moderator after the launch. 
          <p> We are all products of our enculturation. <a href="#banks" name="banksfoot">James 
            Banks</a> (1988), a noted scholar looking at cultural point of reference, 
            concluded that egocentric individuals are denied important parts of 
            the human experience. ArtsNet Minnesota is organized using a social 
            reconstructionist approach (<a href="#freedman" name="freedmanfoot">Freedman</a>, 
            1994; <a href="#hicks" name="hicksfoot">Hicks</a>, 1994; <a href="#may" name="mayfoot">May</a>, 
            1994). New Media Initiatives experts (Steve Deitz from the Walker 
            Art Center, Scott Sayre from the Minneapolis Institute of Arts), classroom 
            teachers from across Minnesota, museum staff (Jackie Copeland and 
            Karen Moss, from the Walker Art Center, Kate Johnson, from The Minneapolis 
            Institute of Arts and Colleen Sheehey from the Weisman Art Museum) 
            and Minnesota students all continue to contribute essential components 
            to the development of ArtsNet Minnesota. 
          <p> This project represents solid theory to practice connection (<a href="#bergman" name="bergmanfoot">Bergman 
            Feiring</a>, 1997). We synthesized the knowledge gathered by others 
            and used this information as a foundation. I would like to thank all 
            the people referenced in this article for their contribution to our 
            project. I would like to send special accolades to the Getty Education 
            Institute for the Arts for their pioneering efforts and to The Blandin 
            Foundation of Minnesota for our financial support. The future direction 
            of ANM will be the cumulative sum of all participants and their continuing 
            experiential growth and development. Unlike hard copy projects, there 
            is no final publication date on the Internet.
          <p> Although the number of messages processed, over 900, has been challenging, 
            I believe ArtsNet has met the stated mission: "to create new relationships 
            and to provide previously unavailable opportunities and resources 
            for communication between all peoples interested in the arts and art 
            education in Minnesota." 
          <p> 
          <h3>Future Recommendations</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Increase student generated curriculum and interactivity. 
            <li>Increase hyperlinks to related resources. 
            <li>Add more artworks. 
            <li>Plan a teacher workshop retreat. 
            <li>Pursue funding for slide sets of works online to be used for "realtime" 
              lectures to be connected to student ArtsNet Minnesota website assignments. 
            <li>Create an administrative link. 
            <li>Create student listserv.
