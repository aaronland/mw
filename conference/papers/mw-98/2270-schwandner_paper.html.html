            <h4><a

href="../../bios/schwandner.html">Dr. Gerd Schwandner</a></h4>
            <p>The <a href="../http://www.zkm.de/">ZKM I Center for Art and Media 
              Karlsruhe</a> - founded in 1989 - is a unique new cultural foundation. 
              As is the norm for every cultural institution in Germany, the ZKM 
              is funded 100% by public money.The ZKM is a Public Foundation (Stiftung 
              des &ouml;ffentlichen Rechts) created by the State of <a href=



"../http://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/">Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg</a> and the City of 
              <a href="../http://www.karlsruhe.de/">Karlsruhe</a>.</p>
            <p>The ZKM operates in different fields:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Presentation - of the permanent collections of the two museums, 
                and of temporary exhibitions. 
              <li>Production - of visual art, music, theater, opera, dance, etc. 
                and especially interdisciplinary conjunctions between the various 
                art forms as are being afforded by the new media technologies. 
              <li>Research and development - of new theoretical structures and 
                hardware and software tools and interfaces that can afford the 
                cultural development of the new media technologies. 
              <li>Education - addressing the general public and providing resources 
                for academic studies
                <hr align=LEFT>
            </ul>
            <p><b><font size=+1>Financing and Organization</font></b></p>
            <p>The City of <a href="../http://www.karlsruhe.de/">Karlsruhe</a> - 
              a medium sized city of 280 000 inhabitants - has contributed 100% 
              of the costs of establishing the ZKM (totaling DM 153 million). 
              The City of Karlsruhe and the State of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg will 
              each contribute DM 8 million towards the yearly operating costs 
              in 1998. Additional income will be generated by tickets sales, sale 
              of ZKM publications, renting different parts of the facilities, 
              revenues from the restaurant and museum shop. Our target is to generate 
              1,5 million DM in 1998.</p>
            <p>Until now there has only been a small level of private/industrial 
              sponsorship. We expect this to increase as long as 'no strings are 
              attached'. There has been no tradition in Germany for public/private 
              partnership in the area of cultural institutions since the 1930's. 
              For more than sixty years museums, orchestras, theaters, libraries 
              have taken the availability of public mney for granted - sometimes 
              with no specific effort to match the needs of the public. In Germany 
              federal, state and municipal support for the arts amounted to a 
              total of around $10 billion a year in 1994, and is still increasing 
              despite all the complaints about crisis of the public budgets).</p>
            <p>In the context of artistic production, product development revenue 
              and licensing fees are not felt to be relevant. General purpose 
              developments made by the ZKM are shareware. A small number of income 
              generating projects are undertaken that are felt to have cultural 
              and/or social value. The City of Karlsruhe and the State of Baden-W&uuml;rttenberg 
              guarantee long term structural support of the ZKM. Incidental support 
              is used to further increase the ZKM's productivity.

            <p>Target groups and audiences are the general public of Karlsruhe 
              and Germany, as well as European and international visitors, and 
              more specifically the worldwide community of all persons engaged 
              in one way or another in the synergy of all forms of art and new 
              media. Symbolizing the transition into the multimedia era, the ZKM 
              is the world`s first institution dedicated entirely to art as it 
              relates to the new media, and is organized along unconventional 
              lines which gather under one roof the fields of research, development, 
              collection and presentation.</p>
            <p>An initiative of this scale of course embodies many interests/objectives.
            <p> Some are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to promote the evolution of the (interdisciplinary) artistic 
                applications of the media technologies (and to locate these applications 
                in the context of contemporary art as a whole). 
              <li>to create a center of significant contemporary cultural value 
                for the citizens of Karlsruhe and the neighboring regions (including 
                northeast France), as well for national, European and international 
                visitors. 
              <li>to create an European (and international) center of artistic 
                production by providing high level technological and intellectual 
                resources to guest artists (and scientists). 
              <li>to create a media cultural compliment to the overall technological 
                interests and infrastructures of the Karlsruhe region and to add 
                to the overall prestige of Karlsruhe and Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg. 
            </ul>
            <p>To artists-in-residence from all round the world, ZKM offers a 
              platform for critical and creative confrontation with the technological 
              revolution. To the public, ZKM offers an opportunity to share in 
              this exciting process, to play and experiment with unprecedented 
              possibilities.

              In the first 100 days since the opening, more than 100 000 museum

            such as a simulation platform, a motion controlled camera rig, and 
            various virtual reality and spatialised audio systems. Interactive 
            interfacing is also another area that is strongly supported. Our network

          <p>The main limitation regarding the technical facilities is the technical 
            complexity of this sophisticated infrastructure which needs highly

          <p><b>ZKM | Museum for Contemporary Art</b><br>
            With its opening on 18 October 1997 the ZKM | Museum for Contemporary 
            Art for the first time presents a broad selection of its collection 
            on exhibition space of some 4.000 square meters. The collection has 
            been systematically assembled since 1989. While individual works of 
            art were exhibited at earlier 'Multimediale' festivals or at shows 
            in Germany and abroad, the move into permanent premises means it is 
            now possible to display the full range of the collection.</p>
          <p><img src="zkmcam1.jpg" width="193" height="145" align="LEFT"

naturalsizeflag=



"3" border="1">The technical images of photography, video and holography have 
            taken their place alongside the classical genres of painting, graphics 
            and sculpture, and have drastically changed the world of art in the 
            process. The Museum for Contemporary Art meets the challenges posed 
            by these developments: it is a museum of all the arts, and combines 
            painting, graphics, sculpture, photography and media art. Its collection 
            of media art, one of the most extensive to be found in any museum, 
            is especially impressive in juxtaposition with the other genres: the 
            unmoving images geared towards contemplation are confronted with the 
            moving pictures on the monitors and projection surfaces. This dialogue 
            between different art forms opens up new perspectives for the future.</p>
          <p>Included in the exhibits displayed by the Museum for Contemporary 
            Art are 'classical' works of the still-young genre of media art such 
            as Bill Viola's 'The City of Man' and Nam June Paik's 'Passage'. Well-known 
            video artists such as Gary Hill, Marie-Jo Lafontaine, Bruce Nauman 
            and Fabrizio Plessi are represented with important works. After the 
            neo-figuration of post-modernist painting, abstract and representationally 
            abstracting images have returned to the foreground. This aspect is 
            accentuated by the Museum for Contemporary Art, with a special focus 
            being placed on contemporary German painting. The range of photography 
            includes images by Thomas Struth, Thomas Ruff and Andreas Gursky; 
            among the sculptures are works by Christian Boltanski, Ulrich Rueckriem 
            and Imi Knoebel. In this interplay of different genres the Museum 
            for Contemporary Art thus offers a comprehensive panorama of current 
            art.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>Private collections enrich the ZKM | Museum for Contemporary Art<br>
            </b>The 'Collectors' Museum' represents significant addition to the 
            ZKM | Museum for Contemporary Art. A decision by the Ministerial Council 
            of the State of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg foresees the conversion, at 
            a cost of DM 24.5 million, of the currently unused light wells 1 and 
            2 to house the private collections. The City of Karlsruhe has agreed 
            to carry out the basic reconstruction of both light wells, and hand 
            them over free of charge to ZKM for completion. The running costs 
            for the Museum for Contemporary Art will amount to DM 6.3 million, 
            of which sum DM 2.3 million will come from the general State subsidy 
            allocated to ZKM, while the remaining DM 4 million will be furnished 
            by an additional State grant.</p>
          <p>From fall 1999 onward, ZKM will be able to show first-class works 
            from the collections of Frieder Burda, Josef Froehlich, Anni Graesslin, 
            Friedrich Rentschler and Siegfried Weishaupt. They will be complemented 
            by the collection of Count Panza di Biumo of Milan/Varese, which is 
            devoted mainly to contemporary American art. The private collections 
            include works by major contemporary artists such as Baselitz, Polke, 
            Penck, Luepertz, Kiefer, Beuys, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Stella, Haring, 
            Fontana, Oehlen, Mucha, Wols and many others besides. One of the largest 
            groups of modern art collections will then be gathered together in 
            the Museum for Contemporary Art.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>ZKM | Media Museum</b><br>
            The ZKM breaks new ground with its Media Museum. Based on a wholly 
            interactive concept, the museum focuses on the new media. Where do 
            the new technologies come from, how do they affect our way of thinking 
            and our lives, where are they leading us? In a range of interactive 
            installations that involve the spectator, artists and academics deliver 
            informative and entertaining comments on these questions, take a critical 
            look at developments in media technology, and present their own visions.</p>
          <p><img src="zkmcam2.jpg" width="193" height="145" align="LEFT"

naturalsizeflag=



"3" border="1">Most of the installations and works of media art were created directly 
            for the ZKM|Media Museum, and are associated with specific themes 
            it addresses. The Media Bodies section, for instance, shows how our 
            image of the human body is being altered by the new technologies and 
            in particular by simulation techniques. Notions sometimes playing 
            an exaggerated role in discussions about the new media - 'Cyber Space' 
            and 'Virtual Reality' are just two examples - are illuminated playfully 
            and critically by turns. The Media Visions section features a series 
            of imaginative installations offering visitors to the museum a glimpse 
            into the future of media such as books, films and theater. The ZKM|Media 
            Museum also houses an 'interactive art gallery' presenting a selection 
            of interactive works important to the genre's development history, 
            and shows the breadth meanwhile encompassed by the field. Masaki Fujihata`s 
            &quot;Beyond Pages&quot; is one work exhibited, Jeffrey Shaw's 'The 
            Legible City' another.</p>
          <p>'The World of Games' provides visitors with an opportunity to experience 
            at first hand the fascination exuded by computer games, as well as 
            the dangers they harbor. The museum's 'laboratories' are concerned 
            less with artistic content than with equipment, systems and techniques. 
            Visitors are invited to experiment at workstations and acquire their 
            own knowledge of media technology basics.</p>
          <p>The 'Salon Digital' is the museum's virtual wing and ZKM's window 
            to the outside world. Visitors to the salon have full access to the 
            Internet, and surfers on the Net are reciprocally invited to visit 
            the ZKM|Media Museum via the same gateway. A regular program of events 
            organized by visiting curators is foreseen; again, participation by 
            Internet users will be welcomed.</p>

          <p><b>ZKM | Media Library</b><br>
            The collection of contemporary music, videotapes, and literature on 
            20th-century art offered by the ZKM | Media Library is among the widest 
            of its kind. A gold mine for researchers, the library is equally a 
            place where the general public is welcome to spend time browsing and 
            learning. Information about artists and their works can be called 
            up directly from the library's database, and fast viewing and jukebox 
            playback facilities are available for videotapes and CD-ROMs. The 
            Media Library and its collections can also be accessed over the Internet. 
            However, all videotapes, CDs and books can be used on the premises 
            only. The Media Library is divided up into three collections: Audio, 
            Video and Print.</p>
          <p>The Audio Collection is devoted to contemporary music, and places 
            a particular emphasis on electroacoustic music. At present, the collection 
            includes some 12,000 titles supplemented by scores, specialist literature, 
            historical photographs and posters. A major role is played by the 
            International Digital Electroacoustic Music Archives IDEAMA, which 
            encompass all important compositions from the beginnings of electroacoustic 
            music up to the present day. Another department presents the most 
            important works of New Music.</p>
          <p>The designated purpose of the Video Collection is to raise awareness 
            of video as an art form in its own right. It is the first collection 
            of its kind in Germany concerned with presenting the history of video 
            art. The current stock of more than 500 artists' videos accounts for 
            120 hours of running time. Another central aspect of the collection 
            is the video magazine 'Infermental', which is a unique document of 
            1980s video art. An important task in the future will be the conservation 
            of early videotapes already threatened by deterioration - thus, all 
            tapes will be digitized.</p>
          <p>The shared print library of the ZKM and Academy of Design encompasses 
            some 20.000 books and CD-ROMs. 120 periodicals are on hand. The library 
            focuses on art in the 20th century - media art, above all, followed 
            by architecture, design, media theory, film, photography, and electroacoustic 
            music. The two research and development departments are the Institute 
            for Visual Media and the Institute for Music and Acoustics .</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>ZKM | Institute for Visual</b> <b>Media</b><br>
            The ZKM | Institute for Visual Media sees itself as a forum for the 
            creative and critical analysis of a constantly changing media culture. 
            It offers artists-in-residence from all over the world an opportunity 
            to investigate the most recent media technologies and create art-works 
            of different kinds. Artists working at the Institute have access to 
            the full potential of the Institute: sophisticated graphics computers 
            and digital video equipment, as well as a virtual studio and multimedia 
            laboratory. Other focal activities include in-house research, as well 
            as hard- and software development tailored to artistic requirements. 
            The work of the ZKM|Institute for Visual Media centers on those media 
            technologies considered important to contemporary artistic practice: 
            digital video, interactivity, virtual reality, simulation, telecommunications, 
            computer graphics, multimedia and CD-ROM.</p>
          <p>Many works of art produced at the institute have won acknowledgment 
            at international exhibitions, for instance at the Lyons Biennial, 
            the 'Mediascape' show in the Guggenheim Museum, New York, or the Ars 
            Electronica, Linz. Naturally, the works were also shown at the previous 
            Multimediale festivals staged by the ZKM. Many works are the product 
            of cooperation with internationally renowned research institutions 
            and media centers such as the Intercommunication Center (ICC) in Tokyo 
            (JAPAN) or Le Fresnoy in Tourcoing, France.</p>
          <p>The multimedia laboratory established by the institute in collaboration 
            with the ZKM | Media Museum places a special focus on producing CD-ROMs 
            with art content. The annual editions of the interactive CD-ROM magazine 
            'artintact', for example, have been produced in the laboratory since 
            1994.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>ZKM | Institute for Music and Acoustics</b><br>
            The ZKM | Institute for Music and Acoustics unites artistic production 
            with research and development in conjunction with an ambitious schedule 
            of regular events. Over the past few years, artists and engineers 
            have collaborated in the creation of numerous commissioned works and 
            in-house productions that were subsequently presented to the public. 
            The spectrum of works ranges from live electronic compositions for 
            the concert stage to music theater, from loudspeaker installations 
            to film music and radio plays. The institute was also involved in 
            a series of intermedia productions, of which the most recent example 
            is the music-theater project 'To the Unborn Gods'. For this production, 
            which was devised for the ZKM inauguration in collaboration with the 
            ZKM|Institute for Visual Media, composer Kiyoshi Furukawa (JAPAN) 
            and artist Robert Darroll jointly created an audio-visual interactive 
            environment for the theater stage.</p>
          <p>Software engineering is a further aspect of the institute's work. 
            The composition software Common Music/Stella developed there by composer 
            and programmer Heinrich Taube has meanwhile achieved international 
            success - in particular at universities and electronic studios devoted 
            to research and the training of composers.</p>
          <p>In the blue cube-shaped building that fronts the ZKM, the institute 
            has at its disposal a superbly equipped recording studio. It allows 
            the advanced technologies now becoming standard in the media industry 
            to be incorporated in the creative production process from the first 
            step onward.

            of different activities from the artistic events to services for the 
            public and visitors. In general our net visitors are coming from all 
            over the world especially from the USA, Japan, France to name the 
            most active countries. Foreign visitors outnumber German visitors. 
            The ZKM provides the home page in German, English and French in full 
            version and an additional short version in Chinese characters. A new 
            design for the fourth version on the net will be developed and installed 
            in spring 1998.</p>
          <p>One aspect of the new version will be a &quot;live&quot; window into 
            the building by the use of non-security-relevant web cameras . Virtual 
            visitors would be enabled to have an actual view what is happening

border="0"></a>The installation is about the evolutionary development of a three 
            dimensional organic form. It consists of two coupled systems. One 
            system exists in real space, visitors interact with a virtual organic 
            projected onto a screen via s special interface box constructed for 
            that purpose. The second system uses the world wide web as user interface.</p>
          <p>In both systems users evolve a three dimensional organic object created 
            using genetic algorithms. The organic is defined by a genome, a set 
            of components, which is successively mutated by the users. Out of 
            six randomly generated mutations users select one, which in the next 
            step is the starting point for new mutations. This way users choose 
            a thread through a space out of approximately <img src="teneight.gif" width="22" height="8" align=BOTTOM> 
            possible forms.</p>

"3">In the real space users additionally change the shape and behavior of the 
            life like organic object via an interface box. Both systems are coupled 
            and operate on the same data set constituting the genom, actions in 
            the web space effect the real space and vice versa. If a change on 
            the web happens , the organic in the real space slowly morphs towards 
            the web selection, a change in real space directly affects the next 
            web action. Morphogenesis was exhibited at the Multimediale 5 , October 
            18 - November 9 1997 at the ZKM.</p>

            and 19th October 1997 one of our major projects was an internet based 
            video-conferencing-perfomance with the title &quot;<a

            connected 16 Goethe Institutes on four continents with the ZKM opening 
            ceremony, transforming the Karlsruhe event to a real global party. 
            The Australian media-artist Jill Scott, Thomas Gerwin Head of ZKM 
            Audio-Collection and President of World Forum for Acoustic Ecology 
            (WFAE) and artist at the Goethe Institutes exchanged artistic messages 
            like pictures, sound files, web sites and texts. The contributions 
            were not meant as just intellectual discourses but also as representative 
            of the places where the Goethe Institutes are located. So, for example, 
            one the second day of the opening we succeeded in having a Feng Shui 
            examination of new ZKM building organized by the Goethe Institute 
            in Hong Kong which was not only fascinating in terms of being a slightly

            the University of Cambridge (UK), the Universit&auml;t Karlsruhe and 
            the ZKM.The ZKM begun 1992 with the production of the first three 
            dimensional interactive virtual computer animations about Catal H&ouml;y&uuml;k. 
            Catal H&ouml;y&uuml;k in the central anatolian highland in Turkey 
            is an archaeological site of immense international significance, providing 
            the first instance of complex settled life other than Jericho. Some 
            of the spectacular sculptures and paintings are 9000 years old and 
            provide a direct window into neolithic life.</p>
          <p>One of the main tasks of CHAMP is to build a program that runs on 
            all platforms, CD-ROM, the Internet and realtime.</p>
          <p>The objective of CHAMP is for the first time to link video and &quot;virtual&quot; 
            computer reconstructions and archaeological data in an integrated 
            database that will enhance scientific understanding of archaeological 
            sites and presentation of cultural heritage sites to a wider audience 
            and the development of new forms of long-term documentation in the 
            context of new media and the &quot;virtualmuseum&quot;.</p>
          <p>This project got the first prize from the MFG Agen cy (a state agency
