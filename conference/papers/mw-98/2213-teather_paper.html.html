          <p>As museums in recent years rush to get on the web profound, yet very 
            familiar, questions arise about the role of the museum at the beginning 
            of the 21st century.<a

name="century.2" href="#2. This work"><sup>2</sup></a> It is no longer justifiable, 
            however, for museums to claim the pressures to get on the Internet, 
            and the speed with which this has to happen, as an excuse for our 
            failure to engage museological discussion about the museum web phenomenon. 
            If, as some have argued, the museum presence on the web is still technically 
            driven, how can we get it to be museum-driven? And exactly what do 
            we mean by museum-driven when discussing the museum presence on the 
            Internet?</p>
          <p>As Max Anderson has warned,<a name="warned,3" href="#3. Max Anderson"><sup>3</sup></a> 
            the two positions of the nethead enthusiasts and netlash critics are 
            difficult to translate into the museum world for it is possible to 
            be an enthusiast and be foreboding about museum impacts. Others who 
            are critics are often the very ones engaging the new technology in 
            meaningful ways. </p>
          <p>Still, there are two fundamental questions that separate museum people 
            in a discussion about museum phenomena on the web. First, can or indeed 
            should the museum fundamentally be transferred to the web? If you 
            believe that the web is a revolutionary, new form of human communication, 
            you will see attempts to carry museums onto the web as ridiculous 
            and doomed. Others see the Internet, particularly when looked at historically, 
            as yet another technology. Perhaps the Web will end up as the video 
            disk once expected to revolutionize the museum experience and now 
            used in quite ordinary ways.<a name="ordinary ways.4"

href="#4. Doron Swade"><sup>4</sup></a> Whatever their differences, both groups 
            view the Internet as something to be wary of and therefore probably 
            inappropriate to museums. Where can the Internet, built upon a new 
            form of representation, fit a museum's mandate if you believe that 
            a &quot;museum is an institution that is dedicated to the belief that 
            the material-three-dimensional artefactual world, the &#145;bit of 
            wood,' is something valid in its own right and represents an important 
            aspect of human culture&quot; as does Tom Wright of the Science Museum,<a

name="Museum,5" href="#5. Tom Wright"><sup>5</sup> </a></p>
          <p>There are those, then, who would argue that the museum, as we have 
            known it, is over: or at least the museum experience before real, 
            authentic and three-dimensional objects, art works, or specimens, 
            in a specific museological space. Of course, millennial pessimism 
            about museums exists in a number of fields of museology. Museologist 
            Tomislav Sola writes of a global identity crisis and the end of the 
            museum as we know it, &quot;In a short while the traditional museum 
            will not be able to respond to the new challenges of our world (...) 
            the very idea of museums will become obsolete.&quot;<a name="obsolete.&quot;6"

href="#6. Tomislav Sola"><sup>6</sup></a> Others extend this argument to the web 
            experience: the museum on the web is not about art, not about objects, 
            and not museological in essence, but a new, a completely different 
            and revolutionary phenomenon, still to be discovered. Let the museum 
            be the museum and the web be the web.</p>
          <p>We even disagree on the future impact on visitorship to museums.

          <p>Besser, though, seems cautious about the losses to be incurred in 
            the transformation of museums on the web as &quot;&#145;the aura&#146; 
            is lost,&quot; referring to Walter Benjamin, &quot;the viewing of 
            a unique object within the same context and setting as everyone else.&quot;<a

name="everyone else.&quot;11" href="#11. Besser"><sup>11</sup></a> As the museum 
            becomes more like a library rather than an archive, he predicts that 
            visitors will want an interactive role, the authority of the curator

          <p>Strangely, thus far in the evolution of discussions of museums on 
            the web there have been only a few murmurs about museological precepts 
            and in particular about the importance of the public experience of 
            the museum in our discussions of museums and museology on the web.<a

name="the web.15" href="#15. Exceptions"><sup>15</sup></a> So far in my readings 
            about museums and the web, the conceptual museum approaches of collections 
            managers, of information scientists or even research enthusiasts overwhelmingly 
            inform the museum web discussion; at the same time in practice museum 
            efforts reflect a public relations and commercial impulse in web development 
            with some important educational and interactive exceptions. In discussions 
            about the web, we also see the development of the argument that the 
            museum is essentially about information, although sometimes linking 
            this informational view to the social and transforming nature of museums. 
            This viewpoint it would appear has very much been adopted by those 
            who are involved in the development of new technologies in museums. 
            Are there other views of the museum that can expand our view of the 
            web presence?</p>
          <p>For one, the field of evaluation of museums and their publics has 
            a century of study behind it and a way of thinking about museums that 
            has fundamentally altered our way of conceptualizing a museum but 
            some of the older notions remain in museum discussion as permanent 
            and repeating themes. The existing approaches to museums and the web, 
            for the most part, ignore yet another idea of the museum which has 
            had some support for decades. This view holds that museums are about 
            people and the meanings that they are trying on the one hand to convey 
            or, on the other the meanings that they are making of the museum experience. 
            People then, not the object or the information, are at the centre 
            of the museum experience. It is people who use and save the objects, 
            it is people who form collections and then it is people who create 
            the power structures and environments of the four-walled museums. 
            It is also people -- whether individually, in a group or a community 
            -- who make up both the visitors and the non-visitors to museums but 
            who are still museum clients. It is these people whose view of the 
            museums give it existence whether in practical terms of tax dollars 
            or legislative validity or in the sense that they come to the museum, 
            accessing it directly or indirectly, for research,enlightenment, education, 
            entertainment or status. So, too, by extension, it is people who are 
            at the centre of the museum experience on the web.</p>
          <p>If so, then the work of studies about the public in, as well as general 
            attitudes to, museums become critical to our thinking about the museum 
            in its myriad of forms including that of being on the web. Yet, it 
            is noteworthy that little bridging has occurred between the museological 
            fields of visitor research and web development. Is it just that the 
            web museum displays the same characteristics of all web endeavour 
            that undervalues the user-perspective in design and development?</p>
          <p>At the same time I would argue our impulse to go to the web occurs 
            without the context of the whole area of Human-Computer Interface 
            or User-Centered design work, built from fields such as computer science 
            and industrial design, information studies, education and cognitive 
            psychology and Human-Computer Interface and now turning to look at 
            the web.</p>
          <p>This paper, then, will attempt to begin to bridge several fields 
            of interest including that of research about the museum learning and 
            experience and new museological perspectives as a context for our 
            museum web vision. It will follow with a discussion of user-centred, 
            or Human-Computer Interface research and some of the nascent museum 
            web evaluation work going on with suggestions for future development.

          <p>Before we begin to lay out the state of research about museums and 
            their publics and the web and its publics, then, we need to set the 
            stage of the museological discussion. Current research about the museum 
            and the museum experience takes us into a museum paradigm based in 
            the user-created experience of museums that goes to the very essence 
            of making museums. This is an idea of museum that could adapt to the 
            web in ways that support, and extend, the museum idea. From this viewpoint, 
            then, what is the essence of the museum experience that we wish to 
            transfer to the web and what can we effectively create in web technology 
            given current developments? More than the object fetishism, more than 
            information and data transfer, and certainly more than public relations 
            and sales opportunities, the museum experience is about meaning and 
            knowledge building that is based in the visitor, or in people&#146;s 
            experience of the museum. Such a perspective, I suggest profoundly 
            alters the way in which we would approach museum web making.</p>
          <p>Let me just unpack some of the views of museums that are around us. 
            It is possible to map the concepts of recent, and indeed past, discussions 
            of museology around a number of problematiques of museological models-of-knowing, 
            at the root of all reflective practice and the essence of thinking 
            about museums.<a name="museums.16" href="#16. See Lynne Teather"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

          <font face="Arial"> 
          <p>The fundamental question that divides our thought about museums on 
            the web is the elementary question of what is a museum? For at the 
            heart of this discussion is the idea of museum that you have, and 
            consequently the idea of museology that goes with it. Let me try to 
            release you from the notion that there is any one, correct, historically 
            accurate definition of a museum. As Francis Henry Taylor wrote in 
            1945 in <u>Babel&#146;s Tower: The Dilemma of the Modern Museum</u>, 
            &quot;Each generation has been obliged to interpret this vague word 
            &#145;museum&#146; according to the social requirements of the day.&quot;<a

name="the day.&quot;17" href="#17. Francis Henry Taylor"><sup>17</sup></a> Too 
            often, we work within stereotypical definitions of museum arguments 
            within the museum profession that are quite ahistorical. Furthermore, 
            we operate without the benefit of an overview of the conceptual frameworks 
            of museology that are available to us and make up the over one hundred 
            years of the study of museums. </p>
          <p>Many of the philosophical discussions about the museum center around 
            the questions of definition and terms like &quot;traditional&quot; 
            and &quot;new&quot; museums are part of the historical landscape. 
            It has been an unproved axiom of museums that museums are at their 
            essence unique institutions devoted to concrete objects, physical 
            things, the material remains of the past. From this view another variation 
            on the definition of museums is framed, as Weil and Harrison <a name="Weil and Harrison18" href="#18. Stephen Weil,"><sup>18</sup></a> 
            have pointed out, in terms of the functions and operations of museums 
            as concrete and tangible phenomena, much like the collections on which 
            they are based. First, there are the collections; using a linear view 
            one evolves to what to do to them, to collect, conserve, present and 
            interpret in some combination of terms. It becomes difficult to include 
            museums or museum-related organizations with living collections or 
            even no collections, or those based on an exhibiting model wherein 
            the material shown comes into the place rather than being held there 
            permanently. It is also difficult to include a museum model based 
            on experience or concept as in the case of science, interpretive centres 
            or art centres where the experience of electricity, of nature or of 
            art becomes the component of the museum experience. Within this view, 
            starting as it does with the things on which museums are based, people, 
            those who view the museum, are often thought of last in the line of 
            functions -- the auxilliary function of museums. </p>
          <p>All too often this interpretation of museums sees the museum in terms 
            of a building and the functions within it. The praxis of museums would 
            dominate the discussion in terms of the how to, the what rather than 
            the why. Most often, thought about the museum -- and certainly education 
            or training to work in one -- is reduced to expertise about a specific 
            discipline with some add on techniques that support the application 
            of that knowledge within a museum. </p>
          <p>Most often the view of museums centres on &quot;things&quot; or &quot;objects&quot; 
            as the essence of the museums role and function, the beginning point 
            of the collecting function at the heart of museums role. Interestingly, 
            Maxwell Anderson with his enthusiasm for new technologies and the 
            web still retains the strong belief in the museum&#146;s special role 
            as a place of &quot;objects&quot;. For him, the power of the web is 
            that of bringing the visitor to the museum for the unique confrontation 
            with art and to share in the same experience known to curators and 
            connoisseurs.<a name="connoisseurs.19"

href="#19. Presentation"><sup>19</sup> </a>But is it the objects or the ideas 
            they represent that museums hold and nurture? This is a question long 
            argued in the museum world. The classic debate between Benjamin Ives 
            Gilman and George Brown Goode,<a name="George Brown Goode,20"

href="#20. Benjamin Ives Gilman"><sup>20</sup></a> that every museology student 
            is introduced to in the early months of their study, was reenacted 
            in the debate between Cameron and Knetz and Wright in the late 1960s<a name="late 1960s21"

href="#21. Duncan Cameron"><sup>21</sup></a> and reappears in the web discussions. 
          </p>
          <p>MacDonald and Alsford echoed these earlier debates when they raised 
            the view of museums as information within their models of museums' 
            roles,<a name="museums roles,22"

href="#22. George F. MacDonald"><sup>22</sup></a> claiming that the &quot;advantage 
            of a shift in orientation away from objects towards information is 
            that it should make it easier (when formulating museums&#146; mission, 
            for instance) to balance the traditional functions of collection, 
            preservation, research and display. A more recent version of the debate 
            has occurred around the Information Highway discussion. Deirdre Stam 
            proposed &quot;the importance of the &#145;information base&#146; 
            underlying museums missions and functions, and its potential for supporting 
            more cohesive and integrated institutions.&quot;<a name="institutions.&quot;23" href="#23. Deirdre Stam"><sup>23</sup></a> 
            Stam interprets the axioms of The New Museology as invoking the museum&#146;s 
            information base, &quot;The full complex of data supporting institutional 
            activities ranging from the pragmatics of acquisition to the abstractions 
            of interpretive display.&quot;<a name="display.&quot;24"

href="#24. Ibid."><sup>24</sup></a></p>
          <p>Although usually separated conceptually by a functional view of museums, 
            the information elements of the museum, although generated by different 
            departments and processes, are conceptually tied, because they are 
            connected to the whole purpose of the museum and its mission. Stam 
            also raises the implications of tying the information base of the 
            museum to the axioms of The New Museology of &quot;value, meaning, 
            power, control, interaction with visitors, interpretation, understanding, 
            authenticity and authority.&quot;<a

name="authority.&quot;25" href="#25. Ibid."><sup>25</sup></a> She then continues 
            to take the ideas of information and The New Museology to museum praxis, 
            internal and external operations, to see how they can be reworked 
            to respond to the new conceptualization of museums with information 
            as a resource at the heart of its functions: </p>

                    such as coordinating curatorial and conservation files, providing 
                    wider access for staff and public to newly coordinated institutional 
                    data, drawing more deeply from sources that reveal the context 
                    of objects (through more assiduous use of published material 
                    and original archival resources), and preparing more sensitively 
                    for relating to the community at large (by conducting research 
                    on and with visitor constituencies).&quot;<a name="constituencies).&quot;26"

          <p>Others, often with information science, library science or collections 
            management orientations, have picked up on this approach to the new 
            reform of museums in the Information Age and describe the museum and 
            its survival in terms of the Information revolution. But there is 
            a big difference between the terms &#145;information&#146; and &#145;concepts&#146;, 
            at least in their implications. While I value the view of museums 
            as information places, I think that this definition of museums can 
            stretch the museum off balance as much as traditional notions of museums 
            as pure object collections generated phenomena and could lead to a 
            philosophy of information for information&#146;s sake. This is an 
            approach to the technological iterations of the museum that forsakes 
            the experience base of the museum as places of meaning making and 
            knowledge and understanding. Even George MacDonald and Stephen Alsford 
            have written of the other equally important modes of museum including 
            the Museum as symbol, vision, showcase, treasure-house, memory, communicator, 
            mentor, celebration, host and resource.<a name="resource.27" href="#27. George MacDonald"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
          <p>With the mention of George MacDonald, we cannot escape another related 
            debate, what are the appropriate roles of museums as especially defined 
            as seen between the oppositions of education and entertainment and 
            the move to Disneyfication? Echoes of these arguments are found within 
            the web and the differences of design approaches from the entertainment 
            thrust of a David Siegel to the user orientations of Jakob Nielsen. 
            <a name="Jakob Nielsen.28" href="#28. David Siegel"><sup>28</sup></a> 
            So Negroponte can actually refer to himself as P.T. Barnum, a great 
            museum man of a type for the nineteenth century. One feels that some 
            of the discussions about museums on the web have to do with old ghosts 
            of the &quot;dime museums&quot; of earlier museum history as recast 
            in the onslaught of the &quot;heritage industry&quot; and the movement 
            of museums to web entertainment forms.</p>
          <p>An alternative view to any of the above is one that is essentially 
            phenomenological, moving to the view that museums are steeped in the 
            human psyche. The museum is defined in more abstract terms as an idea, 
            even a human process, that takes a variety of forms from the personal 
            collection to the formality of the British Museum. Flipping the traditional 
            model of museum functions, the visitor is the start of the museum 
            phenomenon. Beyond this it is also possible to go beyond the visitor 
            to people in general. At the heart of this view, lies the idea of 
            the making of museums, possible to all peoples, across all cultures 
            and all classes and a wide variety of forms, that can include material 
            evidence, animate or inanimate from art to artifact to anteater, or 
            ideas and experience, encompassing the phenomenon of living. </p>
          <p>If you believe that the museum today is one static form, resembling 
            the large state museums of nations, then you will see the trend to 
            the web as a fundamentally new entity, which resembles that of its 
            forebears only in small part. In contrast, it may actually be possible 
            to posit that the museum, is a dynamic, complex and variable human 
            form of endeavour, an entity which has shown over time adaptive qualities 
            as it transforms to new societal developments at least in some form. 
            Therefore, the museum with the web is yet another adaptation of this 
            human phenomenon of collecting and showing, which has been in evidence 
            in human civilization for many, many centuries, and hence can be analyzed 
            with museological ideas and tools.</p>
          <p>At this point, we must acknowledge that we have fundamentally inverted 
            the definition of the museum, to one that is much more about human 
            experience, about people as museum makers and as those who make meaning 
            in museums. This is a person-centred model of the museum idea. This 
            shift in emphasis acknowledges that museums are not set in time, but 
            are still constantly being created and re-created. In North America, 
            I believe, that our notions of the living foundation of museums comes 
            as much from the nearness of living cultures that contest attempts 
            to put them in cases, whether that be of First Nations or other cultural 
            communities.</p>
          <p>By this argument, clearly, I am not suggesting the transferring of 
            the museum as traditionally and statically defined over to the web 
            but a definition that is more dynamic and historically set in its 
            complex forms of human act of saving and showing material culture, 
            and its reflection upon the individual and social psyche.<a name="psyche.29"

href="#29. Lynne Teather"><sup>29</sup></a> Thus, it is in the personal experience 
            of museums that the essence of the museum lies. The museum as idea 
            then can rest in the museum that you make in the corner of your house, 
            in the eight-columned imitation of a Greek temple, or indeed on the 
            web in a virtual museum or of a museum virtually represented. The 
            museum then exists in a triad of modes -- object, meaning, and personhood. 
            It is in the interrelationship of these that the museum exists and 
            this multiplicity of functions knits the variety of views about museums 
            together into a dialectical argument that reasserts itself again and 
            again over time. Perhaps it is time to reject false oppositions and 
            accept the ambiguity of the museum definition as human and social 
            form that has its own permanence and longevity, that is inherently 
            about things, ideas and people and their interrelationships.</p>
          <p>Consequently, if you believe that the museum today exists in a complex 
            of forms, sizes, types and intents, that is essentially mirroring 
            the idea of museums--a meta-museology, if you like -- rather than 
            one specific form of museum then you will see the museum on the web 
            as yet another form of communication that can be as museological as 
            any other and which shares some of the same tensions of politics, 
            and meaning of the four-walled physical spaces of museums. Perhaps 
            the very essence of museums and their relationship to people and objects 
            can actually be finally fulfilled through use of web and Internet 
            technology to invoke multiple discourses about the meanings.</p>

          <p>Another view of the question of what is a museum is discussed in 
            museology in terms of the appropriate role for museums; should they 
            be centres of research, education or entertainment. In 1971, Duncan 
            Cameron published his classic article &quot;The Museum: A Temple or 
            Forum?&quot; that has influenced so many modern museum discussions. 
            For Cameron, museums were in an &quot;identity crisis,&quot; split 
            between their roles as a temple or as a forum. His answer was that 
            museums should be both, but especially they &quot;must institute reform 
            and create an equality of cultural opportunity.&quot; For Society 
            would &quot;no longer tolerate institutions that serve a minority 
            audience of the elite.&quot;<a

name="the elite.&quot;35" href="#35. Duncan Cameron"><sup>35</sup></a> Many authors 
            have written in similar vein, so we find echoes of the views of the 
            social and educational mission of museums in the AAM&#146;s <u>Museums 
            for a New Century </u>and reiterated forcefully in the AAM&#146;s 
            <u>Excellence and Equity</u><a name="Excellence and Equity36"

            in various parts of the world dealing with museological exploration. 
          </p>
          <p>The approach was perhaps most clearly articulated by the ecomuseum 
            movement that started in France, crystallized in the work of George 
            Henri Riviere, one of the original and most influential museologists, 
            and Huges de Varine. The word ecomuseum was first introduced in the 
            1971 ICOM general conference in Grenoble and first depicted at le 
            Creusot, Montceau les Mines. The large established museums, like the 
            Louvre, represented &quot;old or traditional museology&quot;. &quot;New 
            Museology &quot; was about the local community&#146;s attempt to retain 
            its identity amidst extreme industrial transformation using the idea 
            of a museum as social action. These ideas were reiterated in the work 
            of Ren Rivard and Pierre Mayr and in the ecomuseology movement in 
            Quebec and used in the formation of the Muse d&#146;Haute Beauce. 
            <a name="Musee d&#146;Haute Beauce.37" href="#37. Stevenson, Sheila"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
          <p>According to museological thinkers like Ren Rivard, <a name="Ren Rivard,38" href="#38. For more"><sup>38</sup></a> 
            we should note that the museum has evolved from the confines of an 
            institution to a territory and located in a community. The objects 
            have now become the community and the staff are now facilitators engaging 
            in empowering the people to curate and show their own things. Aside 
            from judgments of whether any ecomuseum can truly be participatory 
            in power and direction or whether the institutionalizing tendencies 
            soon take over, we can see that the idea of the ecomuseum has deeply 
            captured thinking about museums in different parts of the world. One 
            of the areas of the world that has been at the forefront in evolving 
            ideas of ecomuseology is that of the countries of Scandinavia that 
            influenced such ecomuseologists as Ren Rivard and in turn have been 
            influenced by them. In a 1992 piece, Ewa Bergdahl, Director of the 
            Ekomuseum Bergslagen (founded in 1984) shared the philosophy:</p>

          <p>The movement for New Museology was occurring in parallel to other 
            questionings of the museum that took the form of analyses of power, 
            ideology and representation and deconstruction combined with questions 
            of the cultural participation in museum by a variety of communities. 
            Museums are being analyzed in terms of their relation of museum to 
            society, economics and politics as part of the discourse of their 
            significance, relevance and meaning. By now many authors have focused 
            on the analysis of museums in terms of the authority they represent 
            and have begun to examine alternatives. Some have approached this 
            critique in terms of Marxian theory as in the work of Duncan and Wallach,<a name="Duncan and Wallach, 40"

href="#40. Carol Duncan"><sup>40</sup></a> (1978). Many others have used the precepts 
            of anthropology to develop a framework for the analysis of power of 
            representation particularly of one people by another, often in terms 
            of the problem of museums in holding and showing the &quot;other.&quot;<a name="&quot;other.&quot;41"

href="#41. See for example George Stocking"><sup>41</sup></a> For some this is 
            through the lens of ideology, rampant in the museum setting.</p>
          <p>Still others have adapted theoretical frameworks based on the literary 
            theories of linguistic and semiotic analyses of museums meaning.<a name="meaning.42"

href="#42. Edwina Taborsky"><sup>42</sup></a> We have seen similar discussions 
            locate on the meaning of objects and material culture particularly.<a name="particularly.43"

href="#43. Susan Pearce"><sup>43</sup></a> In the end, the ideas that museums 
            set a context for meaning and as a consequence that no environment 
            can be neutral have become part of the discourse on museums as we 
            meet the millennium.</p>
          <p>Lisa Roberts sums up this rethinking of the role of the museum as 
            a place where meaning is created and negotiated:</p>

                    the determination of object&#146;s meaning, museums exclude 
                    visitors not only from an awareness that knowledge is something 
                    that is produced but also from the possibility that they themselves 
                    may participate in its production. ..Thus stated, the work 
                    of interpretation becomes an act of empowerment, because it 
                    provides with both the knowledge and the consent to engage 
                    in critical dialogue the messages museums present.&quot;<a name="present.&quot;44"

            Voice&quot; of the museum experience, the tone, the attitude that 
            &quot;pervades museum labels, brochures, exhibitions, catalogues, 
            the guided tour, audio-visual presentations, and now Web sites. For 
            the most part, it is both impersonal and disembodied: ... &quot;<a

name="disembodied: ... &quot;45" href="#45. Peter Walsh"><sup>45</sup></a> &nbsp;Walsh 
            believes in the transformative potential of the linking of the museums 
            and the Web. "This collaboration, properly directed, can not only 
            bring the wealth of museums to a far wider audience, it can help replace 
            the traditional "Unassailable Voice" with one that is kinder, gentler, 
            less pompous, more interesting, and, ultimately, far more inspiring."<a name="good use.&quot; 46" href="#46. Ibid."><sup>46</sup></a></p>
          <p>If we were at all unsure that museums are places of negotiated meaning 
            that can translate into very real political situations the last twenty 
            years have, particularly in North America, brought us to an overwhelming 
            realization of the politicization of museum work and capacity for 
            controversy. Examples abound from the Mapplethorpe show and or &quot;Enola 
            Gay&quot; or in Canada &quot;Spirit Sings&quot;, &quot;Into the Heart 
            of Africa&quot; or the more recent debate over the placement of a

name="Ottawa.47" href="#47. &quot;The Hidden Peoples"><sup>47</sup></a> At the 
            root of these contests is the question of the authority of the museum 
            especially of the curation, and sometimes an exhibition team, to control 
            the message and form of the exhibition. Museum anthropology and some 
            museologists have led the way in this discussion in Canada as evidenced 
            in the work of Michael Ames, Bruce Trigger, Julia Harrison and in 
            the work of the Assembly of First Nations and Canadian Museums Association.<a name="Association.48" href="#48. In Canada,"><sup>48</sup></a></p><b>

            held at the Smithsonian Institution that were followed by publication 
            of texts: <u>Exhibiting Cultures: The Poetics and Politics of Museum

          <p>No longer is it possible to see museum collections or displays as 
            &quot;neutral&quot; statements, even those that have attempted to 
            contextualize material culture in a culturally &#145;sensitive&#146; 
            way. Further museums are, perhaps awkwardly, exploring fundamentally 
            new ways of working with groups in society through advisory, consultative 
            and cooperative methods and even introducing the concepts of shared 
            ownership. Now we struggle to evolve methodologies of collaboration 
            with community groups that are impossible to define fully and to push 
            our exhibition means to allow for multiple voices and authorities; 
            yet within the framework of a civil society that pursues some degree 
            of fairness for all communities.</p>
          <p>I am not yet aware of any museum web pages facing such controversy 
            but we can all imagine it. While we are all wrestling with the thorny

          <p>Another premise of newer notions of museology as identified above 
            must involve the public(s), whether named as visitors, cultural groups 
            or community, within the power equations. We may discuss access to 
            the museum in terms of who comes or of the intellectual access when 
            they do come to a museum and in terms of the entire museum as an effective 
            communication system. We have for decades attempted to permeate the 
            four walls of the museums, to extend the physical reach of the museum 
            by means of outreach programs, circulating exhibits, school kits, 
            buses and trains, and satellite museums to open museums and access 
            galleries that bring the communities into the four walls. Further, 
            we have expanded the notion of access to museums beyond the physical 
            to that of the museum experience, thereby inviting questions of personal 
            and social identity, memorization and meaning-making as well as those 
            of politics and negotiation.</p>
          <p>Worts and Morrisey invoke the words of Neil Postman who states that 
            museums express a need to answer the question of &quot;What it means

                    which is first and foremost a creative psychic space with 
                    the experience of individuals. The physical museum in which 
                    we work is better understood as providing a set of conditions 
                    that can facilitate an individual&#146;s experience of the 
                    muses. If this is true, then the new communication technologies

          <p>In recent years, the philosophy of constructivism has had a major 
            impact on thinking about museums particularly in the areas of museum 
            education, learning and the nature of the museum experience. The ideas 
            of constructivism have been brought to the museum by theorists like 
            George Hein, John Falk and Lynn Dierking and last, but not least, 
            to museums on the web by the work of Jamieson MacKenzie among others. 
            Hein offers a good summary:</p>

                  <td>&quot;Current education literature is dominated by discussions 
                    of constructivism. This new name for a set of old ideas has 
                    major implications for how museums address learning. Constructivism 
                    is particularly appropriate as a basis for museum education 
                    if we consider the wide age range of museum visitors. How 
                    can we accommodate this diverse audience and facilitate their 
                    learning from our objects on their voluntary, short visits?&quot;<a

          <p>Accordingly, MacKenzie, who also espouses constructivism, proposes 
            the idea of &quot;Learning Museums&quot; where students in classrooms 
            become the curators of virtual museums. These are museums that are 
            not only virtual but local and yet global, dynamic, multidisciplinary 
            and multi-sensory, and continually changing.<a name="changing.53"

href="#53. Jamieson MacKenzie"><sup>53</sup></a> According to MacKenzie, &quot;Virtual 
            museums offer a different kind of learning-one which is fresh and 
            vibrant.&quot;<a

name="vibrant.&quot;54" href="#54. Ibid."><sup>54</sup></a></p>
          <p>It turns out that the philosophy of constructivism has been brought 
            to other places that are moving to the web. Dr. Carl Bereiter and 
            Dr. Marlene Scardemelia&#146;s work on the concept of &quot;Knowledge-Building&quot; 
            has been honoured by a number of web thinkers including Seymour Papert 
            who prefers the words &quot;Knowledge-Nurture&quot;. In the last few 
            years these knowledge-building ideas have begun to influence museologists, 
            like the Art Gallery of Ontario&#146;s Doug Worts, some of whom are 
            working on the web and ideas about the museum on the web. </p>
          <p>Rather than following the models of &quot;Ask the Expert,&quot; where 
            the exchange is person-to-person, one with the goods and the other 
            not, or of &quot;Cross-School Research Project&quot;, where students 
            work together or alone to infer knowledge from sources, Bereiter and 
            Scardemelia propose the operation of &quot;The Knowledge Society in 
            Miniature.&quot;<a

name="Miniature.&quot;55" href="#55. Marlene Scardemelia"><sup>55</sup> </a>In 
            this model, all kinds of people and organizations are linked, schools, 
            universities, museums, parents, businesses across a variety of localities 
            by means of an interactive database, CSILE. A constructivist premise, 
            these people who are involved in the actual work of society, &quot;engaged 
            in the construction, utilization, and improvement of knowledge,&quot; 
            are linked so that cross-sector interaction can occur built on participants 
            learning. The intention of this model is that through involvement 
            students do not work within enclaves but interact with the real world 
            of &quot;knowledge work.&quot;<a name="&quot;knowledge work.&quot;56" href="#56. Ibid."><sup>56</sup></a> 
            These same ideas of knowledge-nurturing are at the root of the CSCW 
            (Computer-Supported Cooperative Work) and CSCL (Computer-Supported 
            Cooperative Learning) movements.<a

name="movements.57" href="#57. Ibid."><sup>57</sup></a></p>
          <p>As a result of many of these latest ideas of museums and their publics 
            have brought a shift in museum exhibition and education theory to 
            visitor centred learning and meaning making, as at participatory-learning 
            stations of science museums, or the San Francisco Fine Arts Museum 
            &quot;Game Room&quot;, and at the AGO the &quot;Share Your Reaction&quot; 
            cards and &quot;Explore a Painting in Depth&quot; audio guide. Clearly 
            the implications of these museum learning philosophies will have an 
            impact on the making of web pages and their evaluation.</p>

          <p>Along with ideas of the way in which learning takes place, constructivism 
            has shifted the emphasis both to the way in which individuals construct 
            personal meaning given the processes of memory, identity, and the 
            social context in which this occurs. One of the first works to bring 
            our attention to the human relationship to &quot;things&quot; -- i.e., 
            symbolic objects, artifacts, and works of art -- was the 1981 volume 
            <u>The Meaning of Things</u> by Mihalyi Csikszentmihayli and Rochberg-Halton.<a name="Rochberg-Halton.58"

href="#58. Mihalyi Csikszentmihayli"><sup>58</sup></a>&nbsp; Lois Silverman, following 
            on, has taken for her doctoral dissertation a mass media framework, 
            in which the interpretation of symbolic objects is viewed as a creative, 
            and audience focused process that happens in a context of social and 
            relational meaning of one&#146;s companions. Museums can be a case 
            for study of social construction of meaning particularly through a 
            study of people&#146;s talking with each other.<a name="other.59"

href="#59. Lois Silverman"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
          <p>In studying visitor pairs Silverman deduces seven frames through 
            which to interpret their interactions based on verbal interactions, 
            like object description, evaluation, relation to special knowledge, 
            relation to personal experience. These seven frames fit into three 
            basic modes, the subjective, the objective, and the combination. Silverman 
            also finds that gender, education and age impacts to an extent on 
            which of these modes one uses. Most importantly, Silverman sees the 
            social context, such as the pair relationship, as the filter for the 
            museum experience; these frame constructs, forms of conversation or 
            talk, impacts on the construction and maintenance of meanings whether 
            in the museum or elsewhere. The museum experience, then, occurs within 
            the social context of meaning of messages and socially constructed 
            through talk with companions and for construction of identity. The 
            result is a complete challenge to the sender-receiver linear one-way 
            communication model transmission of intended meaning or messages. 
            Visitors value reminiscing, associating personal experiences, recognizing 
            their taste, appraising the worth of objects they own, expressing 
            their competence, expressing their identity.<a

name="identity.60" href="#60. Ibid.,"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
          <p>Silverman concludes that visitors as meaning-makers may be seen as 
            loss of power or as possible democratizing view of museum experience 
            in that visitors and museum practitioners all learn more about way 
            &quot;things&quot; have meaning in society. She sees that there is 
            a challenge to museum practitioners to reflect the &quot;updated&quot; 
            view of a more interactive, democratic, responsive visitor/museum 
            relationship in all their endeavors. This is not simply a matter of 
            listening to visitors to find out if they heard what we wanted them 
            to hear. It is also a matter of listening to visitors, to find out 
            if and why they are visiting museums and/or even listening at all. 
          </p>
          <p>By extension, the same process will be occurring on the web and invites 
            a test to examine her notions on museum web experience by users. The 
            importance of Silverman and others&#146; work, it would seem is in 
            allowing us to realize that there are a number of communication modes 
            in which museums operate for people, sometimes objective, sometimes 
            subjective, and in combinations of the two. While we may more often 
            choose one mode over another it is also probable that this is in flux 
            according to the moment and social circumstance. The importance of 
            user participation in the museum meaning making, a la Silverman and 
            others, though, has not escaped web makers like Peter Samis, of San 
            Francisco&#146;s Museum of Fine Art, who at the MDA 1995 conference <u>
            Information: The Hidden Resource, Museums and the Internet claimed:</p></u>

          <p>Maria Piacente in her 1996 research also identified several web sites 
            working with the premise of creating dialogue and multiple voices 
            on the web sites. So the Exploratorium&#146;s website &quot;Remembering 
            Nagasaki&quot;, from 1995, with images from a Japanese photographer 
            that documented the horrors of nuclear bombing; with &quot;Atomic 
            Memories&quot; the web audience was invited into the discussion, opening 
            a forum of debate concerning the act of bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
            I agree with Piacente that this web experience not only acknowledges 
            different points of view but looks to the nature of memory and its 
            power not only in museums but on the web.<br>

          </p>
          <p>Still, there are many questions left as to how museums can create 
            constructivist learning opportunities that value the aspects of personal 
            meaning making and how to translate this to the web effectively. We 
            may also need to examine the degree to which constructivism fits the 
            museum model. Clearly at this point the new discourse around museology 
            aligns quite well with constructivist interpretations of the museum 
            and museum experience and possibly for the web.</p>

          </b><font face="Arial"> 
          <p>At the same time as there have been pressures to open up the museums 
            to multiple voices, interpretations and negotiate meanings in political 
            and personal terms terms, there has been an equal if not stronger 
            tendency to corporatism in the museum and these ideas too have influenced 
            the phenomenon of museums on the web. David Bearman has cautioned 
            that museums on the web are not mere distribution systems for collections 
            nor are they cybermarkets but they should be based on the values of 
            museums especially that of interaction and the potential of this technology. 
            There needs to be careful study of the interrelations of economic 
            structures and museums, that I do not think is carried out often enough. 
          </p>
          <p>The web has come to the museum at a time of funding cutbacks and 
            pressures to move to revenue generation, creative fundraising and 
            new management &#150; i.e., retrenchment and downsized &#150; structures. 
            I have previously referred to the process of &quot;the global commercialization 
            of museums and question the loss of our museological souls&quot;<a

            on our career paths. </p>
          <p>So when Stephanie James, a student in our Museum Studies Program 
            conducted a survey on why museums were going to the web in the Spring 
            of 1997, she found the importance of promotion in the rationale for 
            museum web pages based on returns from 40 people, and 33 museums:</p>

          <p>This pattern may not be so unusual; as Bearman has reminded us that 
            technology tends to be introduced in traditional ways, such as in 
            treating the web as a brochure. Nor would it seem are museums much 
            different than any other group on the web. As David Bearman holds 
            out the vision of the RICH future (Repository of the International 
            Culture of Humanity), he also suggests the model of a consortium of 
            museums where the collaboration of numbers of institutions enhances 
            the perspectives of single institutions, where the pool of resources 
            of members can be strategically directed to a usable and desirable 
            product for the public, that can handle the problems of legal challenges 
            of info design and delivery. </p>
          <p>&quot;One of the clearest lessons of the Internet and GII is that 
            structural changes in museum economies and institutional mandates 
            must be anticipated and planned if the opportunity it presents is 
            to be truly transformative. Otherwise the Internet will prove to be 
            just another publication vehicle and the museum community may see 
            little benefit from it -- indeed it could be a threat as other purveyors 
            of cultural heritage squeeze the museums out of the position of being 
            primary providers of cultural experience.<a

name="experience. 67" href="#67. David Bearman"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
          <p>Essentially Bearman is asking how can museums in a digitized world 
            use their social position and content to find ways to pay for a future 
            that is universally accessible? The possibility of Web commerce holds 
            out some hope for many museums. and has been engaged by many. As a 
            client of the Shopping Channel and of web software and book buying, 
            I can see the possibilities of museum web commerce but the discussion 
            of our non-profit limits should also be engaged. </p>
          <p>Further, there are also a number of new management models affecting 
            the approach to museum operations. Whether we think in terms of organizational 
            learning or cooperative work models and wait for the transformation 
            of the museum working space, we can see the importance of engaging 
            the whole museum in the planning, design and evaluation of the museum 
            web presence. Furthermore making new technology, according to the 
            literature of Human-Computer Interface, is complex requiring teamwork: 
            and a multidisciplinary process.<a name="process.68" href="#68. Ron Baecker"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
          <p>The Internet and the Intranet are possible web worlds awaiting the 
            transformed management of museums. What does the movement of Computer 
            Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) have to contribute to our web working 
            methods in museums? Or how many museums web sites show a directory 
            to staff or begin to make transparent the work that they do and in 
            what manner so as to involve the public via the web? Further, are 
            we even using the web to build cooperative work models using the software 
            equivalents of Lotus Notes or CSILE?<a

name="CSILE.69" href="#69. See Proceedings"><sup>69</sup></a> These are issues 
            that museums are only now entering and that will absorb much work 
            in mission discussion, user study and development in upcoming years.

          <p>Given all of the ideas about museums and the museum experience indicated 
            above, what are the implications for thought about museums on the 
            web? Our Webmeisters have already raised questions about the user 
            and the importance of interactivity and participation in the web experience. 
            Are we yet reflecting the rich discussion of museological discourse 
            identified above? So David Bearman asks: </p>
          <div align="center">
            <center>
              <table border="3" cellpadding=3 width="450" >

                  <td>&quot;How can we make the facts of these objects sing to 
                    the virtual visitor? How can we enable them to have an experience? 
                    The first requirement for museums is to recognise that the 
                    networked environment is interactive, and therefore can be 
                    user driven. It enables us to respond to the visitor rather 
                    than pump information at him &lt;sic&gt;. If used to its best 
                    purposes, the networked environment enables a user to construct 
                    an experience with personal meaning.&quot;<a name="meaning.&quot;70" href="#70. David Bearman"><sup>70</sup></a></td>
                </tr>

            </center>
          </div>
          <p>For Bearman and others, the answers lie in the provision of structural 
            metadata that allows for user understanding of context, method and 
            structure, bits in context, to allowing for usability. So thesauri, 
            schema, organic constructs, the terms of information architecture, 
            have to be blended into the user interface in a manner most useful 
            to the user and woven into the museological discourse. There is more 
            to this though: the rich texture of discussion about the museums&#146; 
            publics that has been building for over 100 years. Lynn Dierking will 
            in this session, and her parallel paper, look to the work of Museum 
            Visitor Studies and its implications for the web. Suffice it for me 
            to say that we must not assume the arrogance of the modern that only 
            we have invented thinking about users either in museums or on the 
            web. Perhaps, as important, work in the visitor experience of museums 
            may also have relevance for the field of Human-Computer Interface 
            research. </p>

          <p></b>What do we know about museums and the Web?<b> </b>Gordon has 
            argued that, &quot;The embryonic nature of the Web and its rapidly 
            changing state make evaluation of audience meaningless.&quot;<a name="meaningless.&quot;71" href="#71. Sue Gordon"><sup>71</sup></a> 
            Several recent studies &#150; those by Downs and Quinn -- have shown 
            that little assessment of Web site effects is being done by museums. 
            Findings from the later, the British Columbia Museums Association 
            study to measure the effectiveness of the involvement of cultural 
            heritage institutions with the Internet, showed that very few institutions 
            could assess Internet results in any objective manner. Although museums 
            were highly interested in the Web, their ability and &quot;Professionalism&quot; 
            was &quot;abysmal.&quot;<a name="&quot;abysmal.&quot;72" href="#72. Clifford Quinn"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
          <p>Nevertheless, there is some research occurring on museums' efforts 
            on the web and interest is growing. They are of three general types, 
            borrowing terminology from the Museums Visitor Research field: 1. 
            Front-End; 2. Formative; 3. Summative. In this section of this paper, 
            I will look at the valuations of the web and compare it to models 
            from the field of Human-computer Interface or Usability study in order 
            to explore newer forms of usability study for museum web study.</p>
          <p>First though let us take a brief look at the field of Human-Computer 
            Interface or User-Centered Design and see what is of significance 
            to putting museums on the web. This is not so unusual a notion. There 
            has been an historical connection between museum presentation and 
            ergonomics and design, the forerunner of Human-Computer Interface, 
            that originated in the study of work practices earlier in century 
            eventually named Human Factors- a branch of applied psychology devoted 
            to guiding and enhancing the design of artifacts. Although Human Factors 
            gained attention during W.W.II when it was applied to complex new 
            weaponry it has been expanded to apply to everything from industrial 
            design to exhibit and multi-media exhibits in museums. </p>
          <p>In the field of<i> Human-Computer Interface (HCI)</i>, also called<i> 
            User Interface,</i> we see the extension of Human Factors to the computer 
            world. The premise is that computer systems do not work on their own 
            but are interactive, engaging human users in computer-assisted tasks. 
            It is this play between the user and the machine that is the most 
            significant factor in the success or failure of technology, new or 
            old.</p>

          <p>Such user testing is now a large part of software development. For 
            example in a 1992 survey by Myers and Rosson that brought 74 responses 
            from software developers, 48% of the application code and a comparable 
            development time was assigned to the interface.<a

name="interface.74" href="#74. See John Falk"><sup>74</sup></a> Still, according 
            to many authors, this is an area of evaluation that is still poorly 
            understood and user study is seldom taken up either because it is 
            seen as too expensive or as beyond the abilities. So Wigand et.al. 
            have argued that most web sites are designed &quot;from the organization&#146;s 
            rather than the user&#146;s perspectives&quot; and refer to one report 
            that noted that 90% of companies studied constructed their sites without 
            any consultation with users.<a name="users.75" href="#75. David Kline"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
          <p>Nevertheless the academics and texts recommend user study. Now, similar 
            arguments are occurring for user study and involvement for web product 
            and can be found on the web in the personalities of Jakob Nielsen 
            and David Spiegel and whose guidelines are being consulted by some 
            museum web designers.<a name="designers.76" href="#76. Personal Communication"><sup>76</sup></a> 
            Surely the statistics would be similar for museum web pages.</p>
          <p>According to Ron Baeker et. al. there is a core list of issues for 
            user-centred design that we can take to heart in our approach to museums 
            on the web:</p>

          <p>There are many authors in HCI who have provided lists of design principles 
            for designing interactives. As in Museum Visitor Studies, there are 
            two methodological schools, the quantitative and qualitative. For 
            some authors evaluations must be based on behavioral analysis and 
            empirical measures. For example, Jakob Nielsen&#146;s 1989, &quot;discount 
            usability engineering&quot; work promoted a rigorous quantitative 
            approach with a test of small subsets of the system with relatively 
            few users who think aloud as they work. Nielsen admits that in spite 
            of a process of iterative design, the interface was not perfect. On 
            reflection, developers had used intuition to generate initial user 
            requirements that could indeed be in error<b>. </b>We also see that 
            there is a spectrum of philosophies behind many of these user study 
            enthusiasts from those like Nielsen who evolve from the education 
            and computer school to David Siegel who evolves from the entertainment 
            and design fields. Both though urge extensive user study and involvement.</p>

          <blockquote> <b>
            <p>Early Focus on Users<br></b>
              Designers should have direct contact with intended or actual users- 
              via interviews, observations, surveys, and participatory design. 
              The aim is to understand users&#146; cognitive, behavioural, attendant, 
              anthropometric characteristics -- and the characteristics of the 
              jobs they will be doing.<b></p>
            <p>Early-- and Continual -- User Testing<br></b>
              The only presently feasible approach to successful design is an 
              empirical one, requiring objective and measurement of user behaviour, 
              careful articulation of feedback, insightful solutions to ensuing 
              problems, and strong motivation to make design changes.<b></p>
            <p>Iterative Design<br></b>
              A system under development must be modified based upon results of 
              behavioural tests of functions, user interface, help systems, documentation, 
              training approach. The process of implementation, testing, feedback, 
              evaluation, and changes must be repeated to iteratively improve 
              the system.<b></p>
            <p>Integrated Design<br></b>
              All aspects of usability (e.g., user interface, help systems, a 
              plan, documentation) should evoke in rather than defined s and should 
              be under one management.<b></p></b>

          <p>One of the first sorts of museum web evaluation came from web-based 
            search engines like Lycos that take criteria used to evaluate all 
            web sites and extend to the museum web page. Sometimes these are called 
            competitive analyses. For example the ROM is in the top 5 % as rated 
            by Lycos. Another example of this is Musee which grades museum sites 
            from 1 to 5 on the criteria of 1)Travel Visitor Information, 2) Education 
            Materials, 3) Research, 4) Fun/Entertainment, 5) Shopping and 6) Visual 
            Content. &lt;http:/<a

            I am not sure at this point to what degree such intermediary evaluations 
            affect the museums web page design and re-design. The winning of a 
            high rating is often advertised at a site&#146;s home page but do 
            museums actually aim to be highly rated on them. Operators of these 
            services do indicate that webmasters do ask for advice on how to get 
            a higher rating in their pages.<a name="pages.80" href="#80. Personal Communication"><sup>80</sup></a> 
            Museums &amp; The Web&#146;s &#145;Best of the Web&#146; contest provides 
            us with a peer review method of evaluation in which web pages are 
            divided by type and voted on the web about a month before the conference 
            is held each year. &lt;http:<a

href="../http://www.archimuse.com/mw98/frame_best.html" target="_top">www.archimuse.com/mw98/ 
            frame_best.html</a>&gt;.</p>
          <p>The most frequent type of summative evaluation is of one site by 
            its owner. Hits to sites are mentioned as one measure although it 
            is not very accurate or necessarily a record of any meaning beyond 
            a very general sense of use. Use comment pages and FAQs are the most 
            frequent methods for feedback from audience. Again, to what degree 
            this information is used in reworking web pages remains unknown. Some 
            institutional summative study is also occurring in terms of hits and 
            navigational patterns of visitors to the web. The user log analyses, 
            with the right expertise, can reveal some things about your web site 
            and its effectiveness. Software available for analysis records the 
            length of visit to the site and page, gives demographic information 
            like location of visitor.<a name="visitor.81"

href="#81. Patricia Downs"><sup>81</sup></a> This is the type of study that James 
            Jensen has performed for the National Museum of Science and Technology 
            in Ottawa. Some sites like the Montreal&#146;s Museum of Fine Art, 
            and Ottawa/Hull&#146;s Canadian Museum of Civilization have also created 
            a questionnaire that is filled out as part of the web visit that gives 
            the basics of information on demographics and perhaps even a hint 
            of motivational information. These methods resemble many visitor studies 
            in museums though such studies are biased to the web visitor who comes 
            to the site and not all potential web site visitors. They require 
            a higher level of technical knowledge of web site construction and 
            conceptual linkage.</p>
          <p>Some museums have actually engaged in a visitor study of their web 
            site. The National Museum of American History held a meeting with 
            the Teacher Advisory Committee to discuss educational activities on 
            the web as part of an informal summative evaluation. &lt;http://<a

href="../http://www.si.edu/nmah" target="_top">www.si.edu/nmah</a>&gt; At present, 
            Debra Luneau of the ROM has evolved a questionnaire that she is giving 
            to selected ROM library users who are cued to visit the web site terminals 
            in the Library and make comment. Her work is very much based on the 
            criteria of Jakob Nielsen one of the leading web page evaluators.</p><b> 
          <p>T</b>here have also been a number of academic or independent comparative 
            studies of web pages that are based on what the HC Interface folks 
            called heuristic study. To put this in plain language, the researcher 
            creates categories for measurement of effectiveness based on a personal 
            study of existing criteria, of one&#146;s own experience of the phenomenon 
            and the existing norms of design standards.<a name="standards.82" href="#82. Jakob Nielsen"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
          <p>One example of such a study is that of Maria Piacente in her Masters 
            paper for Museum Studies at the University of Toronto who identified 
            three types of museum web pages and examined them. The first was the 
            &quot;Electronic Brochure&quot;, essentially an advertising sheet 
            format like the brochure or handout used at sites or to get visitors 
            to come to sites. The second was &quot;The Museum in the Virtual World&quot; 
            whereby the actual museum was projected onto the web by means of maps, 
            floorplans, images, online collections or exhibits, both real and 
            virtual. Here, the real-life museum is recreated<a name="recreated83" href="#83. Maria Piacente"><sup>83</sup></a> 
            online. Maria Piacente found this to be the case particularly with 
            some art galleries and used the example of the Philadelphia Museum 
            of Arts Cezanne pages (http://<a

href="../http://libertynet.org/" target="_top">libertynet.org/</a>). There are several 
            variations of this type. Sometimes the world-wide web is used within 
            an exhibition as in the AGO&#146;s &quot;Oh Canada Project&quot;. 
            Some museums are actually using the web site as an archive for former 
            exhibits, that extends the life of special exhibits and gives rich 
            material to the web presence; Piacente's example is the Peabody Museum 
            of Archaeology and Ethnology. &lt; http://<a href="../http://www.peabody.harvard.edu/maria/default.html" target="_top">www.peabody.harvard.edu/maria/default.html</a>&gt; 
            Some museums have designed their web presence as an extended collections 
            access. Examples of the collections based web are the Hooper Virtual 
            Palaeontology Museum, the University of California&#146;s Museum of 
            Palaeontology, the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum &lt; http://<a

href="../http://www.warplane.com/fighters.html/" target="_top">www.warplane.com/fighters.html/</a>&gt;, 
            and Regina&#146;s the Mackenzie Art Gallery material on Sask. artists 
            &lt; http://<a

href="../http://www.uregina.ca/~macken/" target="_top">www.uregina.ca/~macken/</a>&gt;. 
            And some have gone to the establishment of searchable databases for 
            collections information access, i.e Schools, National Museum of American 
            Art. Some of these sites represent deep sites, in the sense of hierarchical 
            connections and hyperlinks. </p>
          <p>Maria Piacente identifies a third of approach to museum web pages, 
            &quot;The True Interactives&quot;. Here, the pages may have some relation 
            to real museum but they also add or reinvent the museum and even invite 
            the audience to do so. Often these sites differentiate the web from 
            museum by its name, especially those of the science centres. So the 
            Exploratorium has the &quot;Learning Studio&quot;. A few art galleries 
            have also taken this approach such as the Dia Centre for the Arts 
            http://<a

href="../http://www.diacenter.org/" target="_top">www.diacenter.org/</a>. Examples 
            of these engaging sites are the Saskatchewan Science Centre &lt; http:// 
            <a

href="../http://www.sciencecentre.sk.ca/" target="_top">www.sciencecentre. sk.ca/</a>&gt;; 
            the Natural History Museum, London &lt; http:// <a href="../http://www.nhm.ac.uk/" target="_top">www.nhm.ac.uk/</a>&gt;; 
            Minneapolis Institute of Arts &lt;http://<a href="../http://www.artsmia.org/" target="_top">www.artsmia.org/</a>&gt;; 
            the Children&#146;s Museum of Indianapolis &lt;http:// <a

href="../http://www.a1.com/children/home.html" target="_top">www.a1.com/children/home.html</a>&gt;; 
            and the Franklin Institute Science Museum&#146;s Science Learning 
            Network &lt;http://<a

href="../http://sln.fi.edu/" target="_top">sln.fi.edu/</a>&gt;. Although Piacente 
            conducted her analysis nearly two years ago, many of her sites remain 
            the leading competitors in such events as the Best of Museums on the 
            Web. </p>
          <p>Piacente&#146;s typology of web pages is very useful particularly 
            because it parallels the typologies we have developed for exhibition 
            analyses.<a name="analyses.84" href="#84. Ibid."><sup>84</sup></a> 
            It also admits that there are multiple purposes not only to museums 
            but to their web pages. Perhaps we should be developing some sense 
            of the complex of museum web page types and that there may be differing 
            purposes and evaluation criteria for them. </p>
          <p>Some other summative comparative studies have been conducted by Katherine 
            Futers and by Dr. David Barr. Futers prepared a study for the Museum 
            Documentation Association in 1996 by surfing for several hours each 
            day to museum web pages and making notes about her experience. Futers, 
            herself a person new to the Internet, concentrated on what was available 
            and how accessible the pages were. She concluded, &quot;There are 
            museums out there that are leading the way in providing strong, useful, 
            productive and entertaining web pages&quot;, noting in particular 
            the work of the Exploratorium.<a name="Exploratorium.85" href="#85. Katherine Futers"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
          <p>Dr. David Barr&#146;s study, although an heuristic one, tried to 
            place the examination within the critical needs of adult and life-long 
            learning. Barr distilled six measurements key to adult learning resources: 
            information content, communication properties, accessibility interactivity, 
            feedback/community and visitor services and three qualities of websites 
            in general: structure, complexity and dynamics. Each of these were 
            then sub-divided until he was testing for 70 indicators, to include 
            such items as total file size, links to related sites, cyberambiance, 
            image to page ration and pattern of hyperlinks. He used the program 
            Web Analyzer 2.0 from In Context Software to quantify the qualitative 
            variables and then performed the analysis.<a name="analysis.86"

href="#86. Dr. David Barr"><sup>86</sup></a> Barr found that four of the most 
            effective sites were highly valued for adult learning; only one, however, 
            was a museum site and the other three commercial adult learning sites.

          <p>Two further types of visitor evaluation occur during the planning 
            and implementation of a projects, 2. Front-end and 3. Formative. There 
            are a few examples of each in the museum web world but not very many 
            as yet. </p>

          <p><a name="09 Web User Studies, 2. Front-end">2. Front-end- User Needs</a></p>
          </b> 
          <p>Several sites have attempted to use the methods of focus groups to 
            look at web possibilities. The McMichael Canadian Art Galleries <i>Artifice</i> 
            project, originally planned as a CD-ROM and now also for the web, 
            began with focus groups with teachers and students from the North 
            York School Board. The Florida Natural History Museum Science has 
            also used front-end evaluation in developing its web pages. No doubt 
            there are some other examples; still for the most part museums have 
            not yet used the front-end methods of user study to any great extent. 
          </p>
          <p>There have been other projects that have more generally attempted 
            to get at the underlying premises of user needs for information from 
            museums. At the National Museums of Scotland<i> Catechism</i> project 
            was a survey of visitor questions by Helen McCorry and Ian Morrison. 
            Catchism was created to test the assumption that &quot;the present 
            approach to museum information is too highly structured and too theoretical 
            and therefore discourages access instead of improving it.&quot; Many 
            of the information databases architectures, according to McCorry have 
            been created based on assumptions based on 1970s and 1980s systems, 
            including manual systems, and their demands, and bibliographic databases 
            where terminology and authority references are controlled and accepted.<a name="accepted.88" href="#88. Jane Sledge"><sup>88</sup></a> 
            These approaches do not readily think about the user in ways appropriate 
            to this new media and usage. </p>
          <p>Another project that must be mentioned is that of the Getty&#146;s 
            AHIP&#146;s <i>Points of View Project</i>, from January of 1995 to 
            Spring of 1997, under the direction of Jane Sledge. It focussed on 
            questions of user&#146;s demands for data as a premise for understanding 
            the users use and need for museum information. Eventually through 
            three focus groups of museum staff and audiences discussions were 
            held regarding the nature of information uses. Then, a number of humanities 
            scholars were studied by Dr. Marcia Bates for their searching behaviours 
            of Getty databases<a name="databases89" href="#89. Marcia Bates"><sup>89</sup></a> 
            with some surprising results. </p>
          <p>Jane Sledge has suggested that:</p>
          <div align="center">
            <center>
              <table border="3" cellpadding=3 width="450" >
                <tr> 
                  <td>&quot;Museum information systems might be more successful 
                    if they provided online assistance for users to develop meta-skills 
                    about questioning, an understanding what information is available 
                    to them, and knowledge about how the information is organized.&quot;<a name="organized.&quot;90" href="#90. Ibid.,"><sup>90</sup></a></td>

              </table>
            </center>
          </div>
          <p>To what degree, then, should the web presence contain a mediated 
            assistance with human intervention versus information architecture? 
            One suggestion has been that information design be set up on a &quot;novice-to 
            expert continuum&quot; depending on existing expertise and interest. 
            This approach has been criticized as too hierarchical and creates 
            a mistaken notion that scholars require &quot;different entry points&quot; 
            than other users.<a

name="users.91" href="#91. Ibid."><sup>91</sup></a>&nbsp; We can see that the 
            novice-expert approach is contrary to constructivist learning ideas.

            Test While</a> In Development</b></p>
          <p>We have now a few examples. Over the last months, the McMichael, 
            with the assistance of Digital Renaissance&#146;s usability architect 
            Diane Howie, has brought the technique of &quot;discount usability 
            engineering&quot; promoted by Jakob Nielsen into use through the development 
            phase of the prototype. Here five interviews were conducted in a one-to-one 
            relationship engaging the user with the product, Artifice, and recording 
            in detail the responses and behaviours.</p>
          <p>In another example, the Indianapolis Children&#146;s Museum has taken 
            a slightly different and more participatory procedure<b> </b>for developing 
            the web site. Inviting web visitors to contribute their ideas to the 
            web making.</p>
          <p>Some museums now are cross-over thinking from exhibits or multi-media 
            to web development, and often have used visitor research<a name="research93" href="#93. As discussed in"><sup>93</sup></a> 
            and evaluation in these settings and are anxious to bring it to the 
            web work. At the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, Linda Ferguson, 
            the &#145;Audience Advocate and Evaluator&#146;, has been conducting 
            a formative evaluation on the new website for logic and user-friendliness.The 
            Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County engaged noted museum 
            evaluator Randy Korn to evaluate both a kiosk and the web page for 
            the traveling exhibit &quot;Cats! Wild to Mild.&quot; These efforts 
            no doubt reveal the extent to which the web efforts are integrated 
            into the other functions, especially that of exhibiting and visitor 
            study, in the museum.</p>
          <p>Again, the field of Human-Computer Interface gives us a sense of 
            all the possibilities of user-study that are open to us. Gould lists

          <p>Clearly museums have only begun to explore the possibilities of user-study 
            for museum web page development. Of course from the preceding argument 
            you will see that I would also like such evaluation to occur within 
            the museological frame of reference. So if we were able to take the 
            premises of New Museology and the newer learning paradigms for museums 
            and if we were able to take the work of visitor research and extend 
            it to the web, we could clarify the premises of web museum evaluation 
            and profitably meld them to the User-centered Design approaches appropriately.</p></font>

          <p>In this section I will attempt to meld the areas of museology, Human-Computer 
            Interface and web page evaluation around an emerging type of museological 
            web page experience. </p>
          <p>One of the most interesting developments mentioned above is that 
            of the evolution of concepts of participatory design. Work in the 
            last two decades in Scandinavia and in some other locations in participatory 
            design for information technology offers some important opportunities 
            that parallel much of the thinking of the New Museology or what I 
            like to call Participatory Museology. Given that some of the thinking 
            of the New Museology (as discussed above) has also occured in Scandinavia, 
            there is an interesting parallel in thought. Such approaches in user-centred 
            design try to move from the lab to the workplace and to adjust to 
            the variety of users involved moving to User-involved design. This 
            approach rejects the catchall imprecision of user study concepts as 
            useless and fundamentally inefficient as, despite user study through 
            all the steps of development, the final test of a project often shows 
            that the results do not fit the users and so begins the remedial action 
            of design.</p>
          <p>Liam Bannon has argued that we switch from the concepts of users 
            to actors to acknowledge the active and agency role of the participants 
            or clients should play in the process of the design. Bannon prefers 
            the word actors to humanize the study, and moves from a concept of 
            human as passive to participatory.<a name="participatory.95"

href="#95. In &quot;From Human"><sup>95</sup></a> Human Factors in his view has 
            often reduced the human element, the user, to &quot;another system 
            component&quot; that underplays issues of individual motivation, membership 
            in a community of workers and the complexities of human action. &quot;People 
            are more than the sum of parts; be they information-processing subsystems 
            or physiological systems, they have a set of values, goals and beliefs 
            about life and work.&quot; For Bannon, they are &quot;active agents&quot; 
            in the design itself. Bannon trained at the University of Toronto 
            where some of the ideas of Scandinavian participatory design and evaluation 
            have made some inroads.</p>
          <p>In Scandinavia, 1970s legislation brought workers into the development 
            of computers design on the principle of codetermination. By the 1980s 
            projects were developed to focus on design of new kinds of computer 
            support using skill and product quality to bring in the users&#146; 
            perspective, thus blending issues of quality management with participatory 
            design. In this practice, emphasis moved from system descriptions 
            to mock-ups and game-like design sessions, to invoke fantasy and imagined 
            futures and involved worker participants in the process.</p>
          <p>B&ouml;dker, Gr&ouml;nboek and Kyng (1993) are participatory design 
            researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark who have developed applications 
            to enhance workplace skills through increased flexibility , interplay 
            between technology and the organization of work in a manner that requires 
            the full cooperation users and developers. So the Project Manager 
            becomes Project Facilitator, and cooperative design the goal:</p>

                <tr> 
                  <td>&quot;Cooperative design which in our perspective means 
                    empowering users to fuller participation and cooperation, 
                    changes the rules of the game...The cooperative design approach 
                    begins by creating and environments in which users and designers 
                    can actively consider the future use situation. It is a process 
                    where users and designers don&#146;t have to wait until the 
                    final act to know if the application will fit the practice 
                    of the users.&quot;<a

          <p>Similarly work in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) 
            and collaborative work (CSCW) offer some important conceptual shifts 
            extending our picture of the user experience beyond the solitary viewer 
            or web user to address more social forms of involvement in the museum 
            experience. These working methods have profound implications for the 
            way we develop new media in our museums that will require re-thinking 
            management structures and philosophies.</p>

          </b></font><font face="Arial"> 
          <p>We need to point out that museums are already working in ways implied 
            by participatory design and in the spirit of cooperative museology 
            as represented in the New Museology. The examples I would point to 
            are the L.A. Culture Net, a three year project that runs to June 1999. 
            &lt;http://<a href="../http://home.lacn.org/LACN/" target="_top">home.lacn.org/LACN/</a>&gt; 
            Here, the point is &quot; people understanding and participating in 
            their community through culture&quot; and through the Internet. So 
            they can hold a &quot;Webraising&quot; where the webmasters and others 
            act as facilitators to the web communities, virtual and other. Here 
            the style of interaction is participatory, and collaborative among 
            cultural and educational organizations and the private sector. Another 
            example of community approach to web making is that of work at the 
            AGO, first with the &quot;Oh! Canada Project&quot; and now with the 
            web cooperative working method of developing the 60&#146;s project.</p>
          <p>Finally, I must admit that I am enamoured of another experiment with 
            the museum as a phenomenon, very much in the spirit of the &quot;New 
            Museology&quot; and the new person-centred museum discussed above, 
            that has been evolving for at least four years. Two artists, Michele 
            Kolnicker and Michael Kiselinger, created a virtual museum, the Heimat 
            Museum, for Castle Toller in Upper Austria. The intention was to gather 
            various ideas and represenations of &quot;heimat&quot;, German for 
            connection to home or homeland, through the WWW. Topics were childhood, 
            community, food, language, living-spaces, surrounding, things, crane-school. 
            Then material would be put on display in multi-media installations 
            and sculptures of all the participants on the occastion of a Regional 
            festival. The project is still going on now, three years after, as 
            each day someone from around the world adds another story, memory 
            and often an image. &lt;http://<a

            This museological exercise symbolizes very well the idea of museums 
            as places of meaning-making and memory as well as that of community, 
            now defined over the Web.</p>
          <p>The possibilities of the web expression of some of the premises of 
            New Museology and of the newer ideas of museums and meaning-making 
            it seems to me are endless and exciting. In the next few years, I 
            believe we will engage the groupware technologies and software to 
            explore Computer-Supported Cooperative Museology and in ways that 
            respond both to the New Museology and the new politics of community 
            and identity in museums. </p>

          <p>With this discussion we have covered a lot of ground in an attempt 
            to tie together several areas of study necessary to conceptualizing 
            and evaluating museums and the web. From the questions of museology, 
            to the understandings of user /usability study, the context for looking 
            and evaluating museums on the web has been explored. What this discussion 
            does invite is the possibility of much more user study in the development 
            phases of museums web activities. It also raises the question of how 
            museums may in fact reconceptualize their relationships with people, 
            groups, and communities using the technology of the Internet and in 
            the spirit of the current discourse in museology. In a sense we have 
            come full circle from the participatory notions of museology to the 
            participatory ideas of user involvement in creating new technologies 
            like the web and both utilizing the study of users and publics to 
            greater benefit of all. </p>
          <p>By now, I also hope that you are convinced that the discussions of 
            museology on the web should occur both within the larger discussion 
            of museums and museology as well as that of Human/Computer Interface 
            study in a manner informed by the nature of museums in all their complexity, 
            including their<b> &quot;Bodies and Souls&quot;</b> as evoked by ecomuseologist
