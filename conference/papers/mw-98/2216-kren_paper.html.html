          <h3> A Virtual Fine Arts Museum on the Web </h3>
          <h4><a href="../../bios/kren.html">Emil 
            Krén</a>, KFKI Computer Systems Corp., Hungary<br>
            <a href="../../bios/marx.html">D. 
            Marx</a>, Lektura Publishing Company, Hungary</h4>
          <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
          <p>Since the appearance of the Web, a new horizon has opened in transferring 
            pictures and viewing them on-line on Internet. Admittedly, besides 
            scientific applications, the primary purpose of creating the Web, 
            the first widespread utilization of this possibility was in the area 
            of "adult pictures". However, the Web being suitable for exhibiting 
            works of art, fine arts also appeared in due time. 
          <p>It was fairly obvious from the very beginning what the Web technology 
            had to offer in education, especially in areas where pictures do not 
            serve merely as illustrations, but are carriers of essential information, 
            as in art. (The same applies e.g. to zoology and botany, too.) Recognizing 
            the immense potential of the Web, a survey was carried out in May 
            1996 on the way it is utilized in art and on what the Web, becoming 
            more and more commercial and extending its scope at the same time, 
            might offer to surfers. We approached these questions as information 
            technologists and people who are keen on art rather than art historians 
            or museologists. After surveying the sites on art history of an academic 
            nature as well as those where works of contemporary artists were exhibited, 
            we focused our attention on the pages of major art museums and the 
            virtual collections of pictures. 
          <p>We do not wish to go in details of this survey as many of the results 
            have already been outdated due to changes in the last two years. Instead, 
            we are summing up conclusions which led us to start the program the 
            result of which is given in the present paper. 
          <p><i>Web Pages of Museums</i></p>
          <ul>
            <li>On the whole, museums reacted with reserve to the new medium demanding 
              a new approach. They may have had several reasons for doing so, 
              e.g. they may have assumed that the numbers of visitors would decrease, 
              they may have had doubts on the quality of digital reproductions 
              and feared illegal use of reproductions now widely available.</li>
            <li>The majority of art museums is present on the Web: they supply 
              information and small size illustrations in order to encourage the 
              public to visit their art collections. In some cases, the information 
              supplied is comparable with the contents of guide-books but they 
              typically do not aim at presenting and describing their collections 
              either in a representative or complete way. (The first signs of 
              a change in this direction dated from the months following the survey.) 
              Museums failed to take the possibilities offered by the Web in education 
              and schools.</li>
          </ul>
          <i>Virtual Art Collections</i> <a name="collect"></a> 
          <ul>
            <li>They were established independently of museums on the initiative 
              of citizens who, with some academic background, were capable of 
              utilizing the potential of the new technology. Neither museum politics, 
              nor the closed nature of a collection can set limits to virtual 
              collections: pictures come from secondary sources. 
            <li>With regard to <i>size</i>, the most <a href="collect.html">significant 
              collections</a> contain 1,000 to 5,000 digital reproductions in 
              the size range of 500-1,000 pixels, they are of 100-200 kbytes and 
              in JPEG format. Additional information to pictures is little and 
              scanty, if any.</li>
            <li>In <i>content</i> they are defined neither by time nor subject, 
              the only criterion of development being size: the bigger, the better. 
              They reflect a predisposition to painting since this is the most 
              spectacular genre of art, others are not represented well.</li>
            <li>With regard to <i>aim</i>, they are intended for browsing without 
              offering a possibility to search for a particular work of art. They 
              are usually structured only according to the alphabetic list of 
              artists.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>2. Targets</h3>
          <p>The survey made it clear that, besides publication, the Web had much 
            to offer in art both in culture and education. Three aspects closely 
            associated with one another were considered to be particularly important: 
          <ul>
            <li>establishing a virtual museum,</li>
            <li>developing a virtual textbook published on the Web, and </li>
            <li>creating a database founded on authentic data which is then made 
              available for the public.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In order to demonstrate possibilities and because of our cultural 
            commitment, we decided to launch a project to create a virtual museum 
            of Hungarian art with the additional aim that the museum thus established 
            should serve as a basis for virtual textbooks and a database on art. 
            We wished to create a Web site which 
          <ul>
            <li>covers all areas and periods of Hungarian fine arts as well as 
              all significant artists and their works without aiming at the presentation 
              of each and every single work of art,</li>
            <li>contains bilingual (English and Hungarian) information on all 
              artists as well as major data on all works of art, and descriptions 
              where necessary,</li>
            <li>is capable of handling pictures and texts together (i.e. they 
              can be downloaded together) and links various types of information 
              within the system (and outside it if and when needed),</li>
            <li>allows search for various aspects with an easy-to-use system,</li>
            <li>offers visitors of the virtual museum further services in order 
              to make their visits more efficient, pleasant and convenient.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>3. Phases of Realization</h3>
          <p>Realization was planned to be carried out in five major phases: 
          <ul>
            <li>developing a system design,</li>
            <li>creating a model and publishing it on the Web in order to develop 
              major elements and to gather operational and maintainance experiences, 
              and, furthermore, to receive and analyse feedback,</li>
            <li>creating the Web site of Hungarian painting,</li>
            <li>adding further branches of fine art to the Web site, and</li>
            <li>developing the site for education and database puposes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The program was launched immediately after the survey. Once a system 
            design had been made, we decided that the model was going to be in 
            English and limited in subject-matter to European Renaissance painting 
            and sculpture in the center but including also the preceding Byzantine 
            and Gothic art as well as the following Manierism and early Baroque 
            (13th and 17th c.). The reason why this was decided was that a part 
            of the pictures necessary for the selected topic was available from 
            Internet sites with free access, thus our scanty means were efficiently 
            allocated for tasks related to the model. Our choice was justified 
            by the fact that the art of the Renaissance is popular all over the 
            world, and that there were no analogue sites on the Web. Our hopes 
            for receiving relevant reactions from the international public appeared 
            to be well founded.

          <p>The <a href="../http://sunserv.kfki.hu/~arthp/" target="_top">Web Gallery 
            of Art</a>, a model with 1,100 pictures, was opened in October 1996, 
            which was then supplemented in several steps to reach the current 
            number of 3,500. All elements of the virtual museum applied by us 
            were tested in this model. "Painting in Hungary from the Beginning 
            to the Mid 20th Century", a Web site with 1,200 pictures was opened 
            in May 1997. It has been doubled both in size and content since then 
            and now serves as a virtual museum of Hungarian art with the title 
            <a href="../http://www.kfki.hu/keptar/" target="_top">Fine Arts in Hungary 
            from the Beginning to the Mid 20th Century</a>. 
          <p>When the state project was launched to help Hungarian schools have 
            access to Internet, the first measures were taken to encourage utilization 
            in education. 
          <h3>4. Description of the Virtual Museum</h3>
          <p><b>4.1 Contents</b></p>
          <p>Pictures in the virtual museum are large size, quality digital reproductions 
            showing the whole, untruncated works of art intended to be viewed 
            on a screen with a resolution of 800 x 600 pixels or higher. 
          <p>Hungarian fine arts are presented as art in Hungary, as customary 
            in Hungarian art history, which means that the collection contains 
            works of art produced in Hungary at the time. (Borders of the country 
            have been modified several times in the course of her history, for 
            the last time after World War I. As a consequence, several major towns 
            which played a significant role in Hungarian art history, together 
            with works of art associated with them, are no longer parts of the 
            mother country.) Works of foreign artists (e.g. Franz Anton Maulbertsch), 
            who influenced the development of Hungarian art while working in the 
            country, are also included in the collection. The collection covers 
            the period from the beginnings (the Hungarian state was established 
            in the 11th c.) to the mid 20th c., excluding only contemporary works 
            and artists. We endeavoured to cover both painting and sculpture in 
            full when major artists and works were selected for presentation but 
            we also tried to include as many representatives and works of other 
            genres as possible (e.g. miniatures, sculptural decorations, glass 
            windows and carpets). 
          <p>Curators of major Hungarian museums were of particularly great assistance 
            at selecting pictures and sources suitable for digitization. Catalogues 
            and other publications made available mostly by museums served as 
            sources of pictures. Unfortunately, Hungarian fine arts are rather 
            scantiliy documented in quality photographs, consequently the contents 
            of the collection were limited by documents available and suitable 
            for digitization, and a certain disproportion was introduced into 
            the collection. Due to lacking visual documentation in appropriate 
            quality, we were obliged to present some of the major works in reproductions 
            of poor quality, knowing that excluding them would have been a far 
            bigger mistake. 
          <p>Biographies of all artists (supplemented with portraits, self-portraits 
            or photos if available), major data on all pictures presented (title, 
            year, technique, size and owner) together with additional information, 
            reviews and analyses are included. Data on pictures and biographies 
            of artists were taken from catalogues of museums and reference books. 
            The majority of analyses came from catalogues and only a minor part 
            was written for the collection by distinguished art historians. This 
            proportion is expected to change after more artists and works of art 
            are added to our collection. 
          <p>For the Web Gallery of Arts pictures were at first collected from 
            various Web sites, with kind permission of the Webmasters, then the 
            collection was systematically supplemented with pictures which we 
            took from books and albums for digital reproduction to be carried 
            out by us. Texts and data were compiled from encyclopedias and reference 
            books. <a name="postcard"></a> 
          <p>In oder to make visits to the virtual museum efficient, search engine 
            and guided tours, two fundamental services, are required which have 
            been continuously introduced and completed with further services. 
            Additional services, e.g. a glossary to make texts easier to understand, 
            and presenting major Hungarian museums were also considered to be 
            indispensable. Pages with such information are continuously added. 
            As the names of towns and villages in reviews and additional information 
            have changed over the years because they do not belong to Hungary 
            any more, an index was compiled to help identify place names. Information 
            on technical details is also available for visitors inexperienced 
            in browsing. Sending pictures, a recent invention, has become popular 
            with our visitors: any picture of the collection can be sent as a 
            virtual <a href="postcard.html">picture postcard</a>. Visitors can 
            send their comments on the gallery via e-mail to the webmaster and 
            sign the guestbook where they are welcome to exchange ideas with each 
            other. <a name="visit"></a> 
          <p><b>4.2. Visiting the Virtual Museum</b></p>
          <p>Visitors can enter the museum on the <a href="main.html">main page</a> 
            where they can decide between the Hungarian and the English version. 
            (Visitors can change from one version to the first page of the other 
            at any time during their visit.) There are three ways of visiting 
            the museum. 
          <p>First, select the name of the artist in the <a href="abcindex.html">alphabetic 
            index</a>, then click on it and the <a href="biograph.html">biography</a> 
            of the artist appears on the screen. Links above and under the text 
            lead to the page where his/her <a href="artworks.html">works of art</a> 
            can be viewed. Major data together with file data can be found next 
            to pictures in thumbnail size (80 pixels wide). There is an icon to 
            show if there are any texts to go with the picture. Clicking on it, 
            visitors can read the <a href="detail.html">comment</a> on a page 
            where the picture appears in medium size (about 200 pixels wide). 
            After clicking either on the thumbnail or the medium-sized picture, 
            visitors can now view the <a href="picture.html">full picture</a>. 
            Links helping navigation are placed at the top and bottom of every 
            page, thus visitors can easily find their ways in the museum. 
          <p>The <a href="search.html">search engine</a> allows search for any 
            picture or information in the text, and the use of Boolean operators 
            makes advanced search possible. In addition, search for the name of 
            the artist, the type and year of the work of art, and the museum where 
            it is located can be easily carried out.<a href="result.html">Search 
            results</a> are presented with thumbnail images and associated data. 
          <p>Visitors can join virtual guided tours to concentrate on a certain 
            aspect, e.g. the art of a particular artist, a period, a style, a 
            genre or a group of monuments. Guided tours are supplemented with 
            extra pages relying on already existing pages of museums, on artists 
            and works of art. 
          <p><b>4.3.Technical Details</b></p>
          <p>The collection is planned to contain 7-10,000 pictures when complete. 
            Taking into account all other files, the number of files in the system 
            is several times as much depending on system organization. The most 
            omportant technical problems to be solved included the following: 
          <ul>
            <li>automatic generation of the large number of HTML files (up to 
              50,000) which can be necessary to organize and present the collection 
              (to minimize manual work), and</li>
            <li>working out a flexible engine for searching pictures and information 
              given in text form.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The system was built on JPEG picture format, the most generally accepted 
            one in Internet. It is a highly compressed format where reduction 
            by 10-15 times of file size results in no or hardly any visible deterioration 
            of quality. Data and texts on pictures are integrated into the comment 
            blocks (part of the file restricted to text) of the JPEG format, a 
            solution not applied in picture collections before. Thus, picture 
            and related text are joined in a single file which, on the one hand, 
            is the basis of the automatic file generation and, on the other hand, 
            allows pictures and texts to be downloaded together (downloaded pictures 
            can be easily identified later). 
          <p>Based on pictures in JPEG format, a program, running under Windows 
            3.1 and Windows '95, was developed which integrated the functionality 
            of the file manager, picture viewer and text editor so that all operations 
            can be carried out while the collection is being compiled or modified. 
            Bearing in mind that repeated changes made and saved in JPEG format 
            deteriorate picture quality, we developed the program to change and 
            save the text in the comment block without actually having to resave 
            the picture in order to ensure unlimited modifications of information 
            in texts. 
          <p>Furthermore, we developed a program which, combined with the previous 
            one, automatically generates all pages in html format necessary for 
            handling the collection by using the texts associated to the pictures. 
            The program generates the pages for the Hungarian and English versions 
            separately. The process in either language takes a medium capacity 
            computer appr. 20-30 minutes without an operator to intervene in case 
            of a collection with 3,000 pictures. 
          <p>Thus, compiling the collection is definetely easier, errors are less 
            likely to occur, maintenance and up-dating are easier to do. Digitizing 
            pictures and typing textual information, however, still have to be 
            done manually. 
          <p>When the search program was developed, it was a major criterion that 
            it should be similar to other search programs on the Web both in appearance 
            and application and should fit the nature of the collection. 
          <p>We tried to minimize technical requirements for visitors of the virtual 
            museum. Browser specific solutions were not applied, possibilities 
            offered by frames were not exploited until recently when they were 
            introduced to guided tours. We avoid producing too big pages and using 
            decorative graphics. A page typically has no more than 10-12 thumbnails. 
            The only significant technical requirement for visitors is that they 
            have Internet access and computers which allow large size pictures 
            in JPEG format to be downloaded and viewed in a reasonable period 
            of time. 
          <h3>5. Experiences</h3>
          <p>According to counters placed on their first pages, the virtual museum 
            and the previous model attracted more than 40,000 visitors during 
            the first 18 months of operation. (This number, however, does not 
            include visitors who enter the museum on a page other than the first. 
            As visitors who keep returning or arrive at the museum with the help 
            of Internet search engines, generally skip the first pages, the actual 
            number of visitors is significantly higher.) Although this number 
            is of no commercial significance, it is considered to be good and 
            satisfactory for a site of this profile and program developers attempt 
            to do their utmost to attract more and more visitors. 
          <p>We received hundreds of notes from visitors of the Web Gallery of 
            Art either by e-mail or by signing the guestbook. Notes contained 
            appreciation and expressions of gratitude, and, as had been anticipated, 
            suggestions for modifications. Most of them were carried out, thus 
            our visitors contributed to making the virtual gallery really "user-friendly". 
            The breakdown of letter-writers by country indicates the distribution 
            of Internet access: the majority of letters came from the USA , Canada 
            and some Western European countries. However, letters arrived from 
            all over the world, from South America, Australia, New Zealand, South 
            Africa and Japan. Letters justified the assumption that the collection 
            was available to and widely used by the public. 
          <p>The letters, in addition to pointing out some minor errors and suggesting 
            ideas for improvement, contain requests and questions which highlight 
            the purpose of utilization beyond the simple browsing. Part of the 
            questions is naive, but the majority deserves more attention. Some 
            typical examples: 
          <ul>
            <li>Quite often a picture or information about a picture is required 
              which is not included in our art collection. In most of the cases 
              reasons are also given (e.g. the letter-writer has seen the original 
              picture somewhere and would like to recall it with the help of the 
              Gallery, or he needs additional information for his school essay).</li>
            <li>There is often an interest in romantic elements of biographies 
              of artists aroused by television programs or films.</li>
            <li>Letter-writers frequently ask for help to identify a work of art 
              which they describe in their letters or enclose a photo of it (questions 
              to be answered are e.g. who painted the picture, what is the title, 
              and where it can be found). In some cases these works of art have 
              been inherited and new owners wish to have them valued.</li>
            <li>Notes are sent by visitors who claim to be descendants of great 
              artists, or persons portrayed in our museum (e.g. we received letters 
              from a Verrocchio, a Lorenzetti, a Mazarin).</li>
            <li>Some letter-writers are interested where printed reproductions 
              of or books on pictures in our collection are available.</li>
            <li>The bulk of letter-writers is represented by students from the 
              USA who wish to have a variety of questions answered urgently at 
              the time of examinations or finals. Letters expressing gratitude 
              show that information from the virtual museum was quoted in school 
              essays.</li>
            <li>A number of teachers from the USA asked for permission if they 
              could use the Web site as a teaching aid.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We have received somewhat less feedback on the Hungarian gallery. 
            The letters came mainly from Hungarians or their descendants living 
            outside Hungary. The questions are similar to those mentioned above, 
            but some of these letters contain an element of patriotic emotion, 
            too. 
          <h3>6. Further Targets</h3>
          <p>Based on the results so far achieved, we wish to continue the program 
            in several directions if the necessary means are available. 
          <ul>
            <li>In order to give a more detailed presentation of fine arts in 
              Hungary, we hope to increase the number of works of art to 5,000 
              at least, thus current disproportions might be reduced. At the same 
              time we are going to increase information in texts.</li>
            <li>We would like to extend the number and content of the guided tours. 
              Doing this we shall try to create a new tool for the propagation 
              of general knowledge on art, a special genre which comprises the 
              characteristics of art exhibition, catalogue, guidebook and essay, 
              based on multimedia Web technology.</li>
            <li>Based on pictures and texts included in the virtual museum, we 
              are going to take steps to create virtual textbooks on art history. 
              We are planning to develop softwares to generate tasks and test 
              knowledge, as well as attractive solutions involving multimedia 
              to make students more interested in learning.</li>
            <li>We consider it justified that an art center be added to the virtual 
              museum in order to organize special (periodic) exhibitions, to publish 
              an art journal on the Web and to maintain an interactive forum to 
              keep in touch with visitors. Contemporary works of art can be exhibited 
              in the virtual exhibition hall in order to counterbalance the lack 
              of contemporary art in the virtual museum.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>7. Conclusions</h3>
          <p>Experiences in connection with the virtual museum and its model can 
            be summed up as follows: 
          <ul>
            <li>with regard to technology it is possible to create and maintain 
              on Internet a large-sized, searchable art collection involving pictures 
              and bilingual texts,</li>
            <li>the demand (especially in countries where the use of Internet 
              has become wide-spread and popular) for virtual art collections 
              offering search and functioning as an interactive forum is considerably 
              great,</li>
            <li>picture collections can be turned into a virtual museum with relatively 
              simple tools,</li>
            <li>in school education there is a considerable demand for information 
              on art history available on Internet, and</li>
            <li>the virtual museum can be turned into a device suitable for making 
              national culture better known.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Although our experiences have not proved it so far, it can be claimed 
            that virtual art collections supplied with authentic data and texts 
            can function as databases and help art historians and museologists 
            with their work. Virtual art collections will, however, never be able 
            to substitute professional databases necessary for museums. 
          <p>The favourable reception of our work have proved that virtual museums 
            created on the Web outside the framework of the museum organizitions 
            are definitely justified. It is true that lack of professionalism 
            may result in deficiencies, however, these can be counterbalanced 
            by technological know-how, by being fully aware of the needs of visitors 
            and by enthusiasm whithout which a task like that could never be accomplished. 
            Nevertheless, we are convinced that creating a real virtual museum 
            needs museum experts. In our capacity as visitors of museums we do 
            seriously hope that museums are soon going to discover a new identity 
            in the virtual world outside stately buildings of museums and face 
            challenges of modern communication technologies.
