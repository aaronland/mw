            The National Graphic Design Image Database at Cooper Union is an on-line 
            system under development at the Herb Lubalin Study Center of Design 
            and Typography in the School of Art. The NGDA Image Database is designed 
            to electronically preserve and disseminate material related to the 
            history of visual communication in the twentieth century. The software, 
            entitled CUImage, enables students, designers and artists to access 
            and input images and analysis from web sites worldwide. Funded by 
            the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the project aims to build 
            a virtual visual encyclopedia through an electronic community of students 
            and educators.
            <p> 
            <h4><a href="#contents" name="collections">Cooper Union Design Collections</a></h4>
            The first phase of the project is to describe the typography and layout 
            features of materials housed at the Lubalin Study Center. The Study 
            Center preserves editorial and identity design by Herb Lubalin A'39, 
            promotions by Lou Dorfsman A'39 for the Columbia Broadcasting System 
            (CBS) and a cross-section of European and American graphic design 
            from World War I to the present. The typographic expressionism of 
            Herb Lubalin is evident in his experimental publication design for 
            Avant Garde and Ulc and his calligraphic logotypes. The Lou Dorfsman 
            Collection is both a design history of CBS and a pictorial history 
            of modern American culture. Dorfsman designed newspaper advertisements 
            with monumental typography and photography for the news, entertainment, 
            radio and sports divisions. The modern and early modern posters at 
            the Study Center cover such topics as: World War I and II propaganda; 
            American film, theater, and concert advertising; Swiss travel announcements; 
            and, Eastern European designs since 1945. 
            <p> The School of Art's 20,000-piece Graphic Design Slide Library 
              is the primary visual resource for CUImage, housing samples from 
              the physical collection and recent donations from designers, design 
              organizations, private collectors and educators. Sample donations 
              have arrived from Massimo Vignelli, the late Paul Rand and George 
              Tscherny, founding contributors to the NGDA Image Database. Elaine 
              Lustig Cohen, owner of Ex Libris, a graphic arts gallery, has generously 
              loaned 1,000 slides of Dada and Russian Constructivist designs.

              Applications</a></h4>
            Both the donations and the database itself will encourage and support 
            interdisciplinary studies of visual history and communication. In 
            preparation for his Fall course, &quot;Studies in Literature,&quot; 
            John Harrington, dean of the Faculty of Humanitites and Social Sciences, 
            loaned images of set designs for twentieth century productions of 
            Shakespeare. Jim Craig, adjunct professor of typography, and Georgette 
            Ballance, adjunct professor of design history and theory, donated 
            slides related to their courses. Margaret Morton, associate professor 
            in the School of art, loaned the Study Center slides of North American 
            designers and urban graphics she documented in New York City's East 
            Village.
            <p> 
            <h4><a href="#contents" name="documents">Database of Exhibition Documents</a></h4>
            Documentation from exhibitions held at the Lubalin Center will also 
            be added to the Database including items from the upcoming exhibition, 
            &quot;Black letter: Type and National Identity&quot; opening in the 
            Winter of 1998. Images from &quot;Ambush in the Streets: A Photographer's 
            Encounter with the Stencil Art of Paris&quot; were recently added 
            to the system. Additional information on projects and collections 
            at the Lubalin Study Center is available on Cooper Union's web site 
            at <a href="../http://www.cooper.edu/art/lubalin/" target="_blank">www.cooper.edu/art/lubalin/</a>.
            <p> 
            <h4><a href="#contents" name="principles">Visual Dictionary of Design 
              Principles</a></h4>
            The system's structure and the knowledge of those performing the visual 
            analysis are critical to the success of the Database. CUImage creates 
            concentric spheres of data around each image record, matching object 
            types and attributes with other images to display common themes and 
            forms. The addition of each term automatically generates new associations 
            and increases exponentially the comparative potential of the Database. 
            Of the 2,000 slides digitized, 1,500 have been analyzed for their 
            form and structure. Entering the descriptive phrase &quot;radial symmetry&quot; 
            yields results ranging from the logo for Chase Manhattan to a spread 
            of ballet dancers in Westvaco Inspirations by Bradbury Thompson. The 
            data structure enables users to trace a creator's signature style. 
            A search for &quot;stripes&quot; in the work of Paul Rand locates 
            a cover for a music magazine, a comp for a children's book jacket; 
            packaging design for computer equipment; and, a logotype for a multimedia 
            company. The striped pattern on the cover of Jazzways, 1943, represents 
            an early application of a form that will dominate his identity design 
            for such companies as Multimedia and IBM. The surface of IBM packaging(above) 
            contrasts sharply with the hand-drawn, organic stripes of Jazzways 
            and the children's book, Sparkle and Spin, 1953. The Image Database 
            provides a platform for tracing the evolution of a style by identifying 
            one modernist's lifelong experimentation with an elementary form.
            <p> 
            <h4><a href="#contents" name="collaborations">Designing Interfaces 
              to Promote Collaborations</a></h4>
            All layers of the software interface may be customized by other organizations 
            to highlight their identity and collection strengths. Through thumbnail, 
            middle- and large-resolution displays, users and contributors may 
            trace images throughout the Database proper to the internet at large. 
            The middle resolution display navigates this journey through a global 
            outline of associations appended to each image. The page contains 
            a checklist of cataloging terms, context notes, basic data and links 
            to related web sites. A list of highlighted terms exposes users to 
            the controlled vocabulary, allowing them to click on any combination 
            of descriptors to revise a search. Web links allow users to reach 
            out beyond the Image Database. A reverse image of Caravaggio's painting, 
            Madonna dei Pellegrini (also known as Madonna of Loreto) is depicted 
            in the exhibition, &quot;Ambush in the Streets&quot; as a stencil 
            on the wall of a Paris street. The Database links this stenciled image 
            with a site displaying the actual painting. A frame for commentary 
            is superimposed at the bottom of the browser window and a new browser 
            opens for each additional link, surrounding the intitial images with 
            an array of related resources.
            <p> 
            <h4><a href="#contents" name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h4>
            The server for the Image Database is located in the Lubalin Center 
            office opposite a four by five foot spread of type from the Gutenberg 
            Bible. The monumental spread of silk-screened type embodies what the 
            electronic archive lacks: scale, texture and physical presence, but 
            the Database substitutes physical access with virtual access, offering 
            an unprecedented multilinear study of design for students who eventually 
            will create electronic exhibitions with a scale and texture all their 
            own.
