            <p><a name="introduction"></a><b><i>Introduction</i></b>&nbsp; 
            <p>A community may be built with bricks and mortar but it is defined 
              by its members, with common ties or interests, who have come together 
              to build a place to live, to grow, to learn, to recognize and to 
              respect the needs of each member. The members of this community 
              are pivotal to its success as it is through them that knowledge 
              is gained and spread. Ideally, each member of a community contributes 
              and in return, receives benefits. Respective responsibilities are 
              determined by the strengths, resources and requirements of each 
              of the members. The virtual museum community has as its building 
              blocks the development of relevant computer programming and the 
              availability of cutting-edge telecommunications, but it too is defined 
              by its members who have come together to learn from each other and 
              to share their knowledge with the world around them. And, just as 
              with all communities, cooperation among inhabitants is, of course, 
              essential for growth and development.&nbsp; 
            <p>Canada, a country at the forefront of telecommunications technology, 
              is the ideal virtual community, connecting geographically disparate 
              museums to each other via the Internet. Canada's virtual museum 
              community began in 1972 when Canada created the National Inventory 
              Programme (NIP), a program within the National Museums of Canada 
              which was a federal crown corporation (i.e a government agency). 
              NIP's mandate was to create computerized inventories of humanities 
              and natural science collections and of archaeological sites in Canada 
              as one means of protecting and preserving Canadian heritage.&nbsp; 
            <p>Canadian museums were enthusiastic partners in this national program, 
              recognizing the potential of national databases to provide information 
              to help in research, exhibition planning, and collections management. 
              A sense of community developed rapidly as museums began communicating 
              with each other, discussing such troublesome questions as consistent 
              documentation of often inconsistent collections.&nbsp; 
            <p>In 1981-82, the National Museum policy was revised and NIP was 
              renamed the Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN). CHIN's 
              mission, to provide collections management services to museums, 
              promoted the use of shared documentation standards. As the technology 
              was upgraded and the network expanded, museums that had collections 
              management databases, housed both internally and on CHIN's mainframe 
              computer, collaborated to create Canada's National Inventories.&nbsp; 
            <p>In 1995, CHIN's mission again changed to "<b>broker effective access 
              to Canadian and international heritage information for public education 
              and enjoyment and for the benefit of Canadian museums</b>". CHIN, 
              as the gateway to Canadian culture, has worked with the Canadian 
              museum community to create information resources and access tools 
              that support public access to Canadian museum collections. The <i>Guide 
              to Canadian Museums and Galleries</i>, launched by CHIN in July 
              1996, is the direct result of a Directors meeting held in the Spring 
              of 1995 where the museum community voiced its desire to use the 
              Internet as one means to attract new audiences, thus enhancing the 
              idea of the virtual community. In keeping with CHIN's new directions, 
              museums were invited to become members or partners with CHIN as 
              joint contributors to a collective resource.&nbsp; 
            <p>The gateway opened and the virtual museum community grew and is 
              continuing to grow. The members of this community, in partnership 
              with CHIN, have come together to build a collective resource on 
              the Internet as unique as the community itself - the <i>Guide to 
              Canadian Museums and Galleries</i>. There is an investment on the 
              part of all members - CHIN maintains all technical components of 
              the <i>Guide</i> in addition to providing Internet accounts and 
              training to Members, while museums contribute information about 
              their collections and events - and therefore, a stake in the future 
              success or failure of the <i>Guide</i>. The more complete and current 
              the information is, the more successful the <i>Guide</i> will be 
              in attracting new audiences and bringing back repeat visitors. With 
              the potential for virtual visits to translate into actual visits, 
              everyone benefits, including the general public who has a new and 
              reliable resource to use.&nbsp; 
            <p>This paper will analyze the <i>Guide</i> in terms of what works 
              and what needs to be reviewed. The concept of "Membership" will 
              also be assessed based on the changing needs of the virtual community 
              - what does membership involve from CHIN's standpoint?, what is 
              the perception of membership among museums?, is 'membership' a valid 
              term to represent the reality of the virtual community? This paper 
              will also examine the future direction of the <i>Guide</i> in terms 
              of the virtual community and perceived challenges for both CHIN 
              and museums.&nbsp;

            <p><a name="whatistheguide"></a><b><i>What is the Guide?</i></b>&nbsp; 
            <p>The <i>Guide to Canadian Museums and Galleries</i>, launched in 
              June 1996, now has more than 250 virtual members. CHIN developed 
              the <i>Guide</i> with the idea of increasing the profile of Canadian 
              museums on the Internet and attracting new visitors. The <i>Guide</i> 
              provides on-line visitors (currently 1/3 of all CHIN Web site visitors) 
              with current information about Canadian museums, their collections, 
              exhibitions, and special events. The <i>Guide</i> groups information 
              about the participating museums into one searchable database which 
              means that with the <i>Guide</i>, a searcher can do a one-stop shopping 
              kind of a search on all museums in a province or city and retrieve 
              information about the museums and their events and exhibitions. 
              A comparable search on the Internet would require a visit to each 
              institution's Web site, and the different search engines would provide 
              different search results meaning that some institutions would be 
              missed out.&nbsp; 
            <p>To participate in the <i>Guide</i>, a museum does not need to have 
              a computer or Internet access. <i>Guide</i> participants receive 
              an information package that includes a membership agreement with 
              CHIN to contribute information about the institution, its permanent 
              collections, its services, and its exhibitions and special events. 
              The museum signs the agreement and returns it to CHIN. Upon receiving 
              the signed agreement, CHIN issues a user ID and password to the 
              contact person in the museum. He or she can then go to any computer 
              with Internet access (e.g. in a library , school, or any other community 
              access point), link to the <i>Guide</i> section of the CHIN Web 
              site (<a href="../http://www.chin.gc.ca/" target="_top">http://www.chin.gc.ca</a>), 
              complete the on-line form. Help with the form is available from 
              CHIN or, where possible, from the regional network or provincial 
              museum association.&nbsp; 
            <p>Eligible <i>Guide</i> participants receive the benefit of an Internet 
              account and training to enable them to explore ways to use the Internet 
              to reach their audiences. Museums that already have an Internet 
              account are offered advanced Internet training courses. For museums 
              that do not have their own Web site, the <i>Guide</i> is an excellent 
              opportunity to be part of the collective Canadian presence on the 
              Internet and to maintain an up-to-date listing of events and exhibitions.&nbsp; 
            <p>For the computerized institutions, much of the dynamic information 
              we ask to have included in the <i>Guide</i> is already in place 
              on their Web site and duplication of effort is an issue. To address 
              this issue, a hybrid system of centralized and distributed information 
              has been established as an interim solution.&nbsp; Museums contribute 
              background information that does not change rapidly and is likely 
              to be a one-time contribution. At the same time, CHIN establishes 
              links to the museum Web sites. To allow comprehensive searches on 
              more changeable information, museums contribute minimal exhibition 
              information (i.e title, dates that can be searched for) to the <i>Guide</i>. 
              Search results from the CHIN site are then linked to the institution's 
              Web site that contains the expanded exhibition or event information. 
              This interim solution reduces the duplication of effort for museums 
              while permitting access to the full information for the public.&nbsp; 
            <p>Once an institution has completed their <i>Guide</i> entry, they 
              are eligible to participate in a coupon program. When a Web visitor 
              reaches the <i>Guide</i> entry of a museum participating in the 
              coupon program, they see an icon for a coupon that they can select. 
              The visitor can then print out the coupon and redeem it at the museum 
              in question for a small gift provided by CHIN. Museums are also 
              encouraged to offer a small gift or a discount (e.g., 10% off the 
              admission price) in addition to the CHIN gift. This program is meant 
              to encourage visitors and to help the museums and CHIN track the 
              use of the on-line <i>Guide</i>. Currently, 62 museums offer coupons.&nbsp; 
            <p><a name="whatworks"></a><b><i>What Works!</i></b>&nbsp; 
            <p>"No man is an island entire of itself" (John Donne, 1571?-1631). 
              No saying could be truer in relation to the <i>Guide</i>. CHIN created 
              the solid foundation from which the <i>Guide</i> could grow, but 
              it has been the partnerships that have been created throughout this 
              project that have allowed the <i>Guide</i> to blossom into a valid 
              on-line resource. These partners include provincial museum associations, 
              regional networks and CHIN members, old and new alike.&nbsp; 
            <p>From the outset, CHIN has worked closely with Provincial Museum 
              Associations (PMAs) and regional networks such as Trillium (Ontario), 
              InfoMuse (Quebec) and Dogwood (British Columbia). In fact, these 
              three provinces have the highest number of entries in the <i>Guide</i>. 
              The networks have helped their members by putting them in touch 
              with local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and by helping them 
              enter their information into the <i>Guide</i>. In provinces that 
              have a regional network, museums that contact CHIN directly about 
              participating in the <i>Guide</i> are encouraged to contact the 
              network coordinator and work through them. In provinces without 
              regional networks, CHIN has worked directly with the provincial 
              museum associations. They have responded with a great deal of enthusiasm 
              and interest. They have provided CHIN with mailing lists of their 
              members and have encouraged their members to participate in the 
              <i>Guide</i>.&nbsp; 
            <p>While the provincial museum associations and regional networks 
              have made important contributions to the success of the <i>Guide</i>, 
              it can not be stressed enough that it is the information contributed 
              by the individual institutions, the members of the virtual community, 
              that has built this credible resource. Indeed, they have a vested 
              interest in the success of the <i>Guide</i> and they have proven, 
              not only with the contribution of their information, but with their 
              enthusiasm and willingness, that they are up for the challenge.&nbsp; 
            <p>What else has worked? The incentive of an Internet account and 
              Internet training in exchange for the museum's information has also 
              encouraged institutions to participate in the <i>Guide</i>. In these 
              times of government cutbacks and lack of funding, heritage institutions, 
              in particular, are not used to receiving benefits of this kind, 
              especially from a government agency. In fact there has been some 
              skepticism that this could actually be true, but for the most part 
              the museum community has responded positively to this program. In 
              addition to receiving Internet accounts and training, institutions 
              have been encouraged and somewhat surprised by how easy it is to 
              enter their information in the <i>Guide</i> using the on-line input 
              forms. CHIN created these forms with a combination of check boxes 
              and text boxes in an effort to make it as easy and as straight-forward 
              as possible for museums to enter their information without getting 
              bogged down by confusing and cumbersome procedures. As well, assistance 
              from the CHIN HelpDesk is only a telephone call or e-mail away. 
              CHIN prides itself on the technical expertise available for its 
              members through the HelpDesk but it is our members themselves who 
              appreciate the fact that an actual person is available to answer 
              their questions.&nbsp; 
            <p><a name="reviewed"></a><b><i>What Needs to be Reviewed!</i></b>&nbsp; 
            <p>As with any new product, with increase use and the passage of time, 
              inconsistencies are identified and have to be reviewed and corrected, 
              if necessary. These include password validation procedures, non-adherence 
              to update schedules, lack of events information and poor usage of 
              the Help file.&nbsp; 
            <p>When a museum completes and returns their agreement with CHIN to 
              contribute information to the <i>Guide</i>, CHIN issues a user ID, 
              a.k.a Guide ID, and password to the appropriate contact person. 
              This Guide ID and password is then used to validate the submission 
              of a museum's information, i.e., the Guide ID and password are entered 
              into the Guide database at the time that they are issued to the 
              institution so that when the institution's information is submitted 
              the system will post this information in the <i>Guide</i> provided 
              that the Guide ID has been entered correctly. The problem begins 
              when a Guide ID is entered incorrectly and the system doesn't recognize 
              it. It takes diligent monitoring by CHIN staff to quickly catch 
              these glitches before the process grinds to a halt. CHIN is currently 
              working on an automatic validation system that will let the institution 
              know immediately if they enter a Guide ID or password incorrectly.&nbsp; 
            <p>CHIN is also working on a system of automatic e-mail reminders. 
              The need for these reminders arises when an institution has not 
              completed their <i>Guide</i> entry (an entry is considered complete 
              if it contains a description of the institution, a brief description 
              of the collections and events information) or had at one point completed 
              their entry but have since let their events information lag and 
              have not updated their entry with new events information. On the 
              information form that is returned to CHIN along with the Agreement, 
              institutions indicate their preferred update schedule, however, 
              there is currently no system procedure in place to ensure that this 
              schedule is maintained or that events information is always present. 
              The events information is pivotal to the success of the <i>Guide</i> 
              - this is the information that prospective cultural tourists to 
              the museum in question want to know. If this information is consistently 
              missing from a <i>Guide</i> entry, it hurts everyone - the museum 
              itself who may have lost a potential visitor and all the institutions 
              in the <i>Guide</i> that do maintain their events information since 
              the on-line visitor may lose faith in the <i>Guide</i> as a valuable 
              resource and not return to the site. CHIN hopes that friendly, system-generated 
              e-mail reminders will solve this problem of missing information.&nbsp; 
            <p>Of concern as well is the poor usage of the Help file. Links to 
              the Help file can be found in several places on the in-put forms 
              and even though every effort has been made to make these links as 
              visible as possible, little use is made of them. CHIN will be revising 
              the Help file as well as trying to increase its visibility. One 
              option being considered is to allow our members to download and 
              print out the entire file prior to entering their <i>Guide</i> information. 
              In this way they would have a handy reference nearby at all times. 
              At this point, however, CHIN is keeping all avenues open and will 
              continue to seek out new solutions to this vexing problem.&nbsp; 
            <p><a name="membership"></a><b><i>CHIN Membership - What is it Anyway?</i></b>&nbsp; 
            <p>There are currently three categories of CHIN Members: Contributing, 
              Basic and Associate. Contributing Members contribute information 
              about their collections, services and events to the <i>Guide to 
              Canadian Museums and Galleries</i> and also contribute at least 
              1000 collection records to the National Inventories, or all collection 
              records if fewer than 1000 objects. Basic Members contribute information 
              to the <i>Guide</i>. Associate Members are usually not-for-profit 
              public heritage institutions without collections or seasonal museums 
              that contribute information to the <i>Guide</i>.&nbsp; 
            <p>To become a CHIN member, organizations must be one of the following:&nbsp; 
              <br>
              - an eligible museum as defined by the Museums Assistance Program 
              of the Department of Canadian Heritage&nbsp; <br>
              - a federal or provincial heritage agency&nbsp; <br>
              - an organization responsible for managing archaeological sites&nbsp; 
              <br>
              - an organization responsible for consolidating collections information 
              for its member institutions&nbsp; <br>
              - a not-for-profit public heritage institution without collections 
              (Associate Member)&nbsp; <br>
              - a seasonal museum (Associate Member)&nbsp; 
            <p><a name="memberbenefits"></a><b><i>Member Benefits</i></b>&nbsp; 
            <p>CHIN Members benefit from increased public exposure and profile 
              within Canada and internationally through participation in the <i>Guide</i>. 
              Each Contributing and Basic Member receives an Internet account 
              and financial support for introductory Internet training or support 
              for advanced Internet training if the institution already has an 
              Internet account. CHIN encourages museums to use this access to 
              explore the potential of the Internet for public programming and 
              marketing and to become part of the virtual museum community.&nbsp; 
            <p>All Members receive a free subscription to access Research and 
              Reference Information in the subscription environment on CHIN's 
              Web site, once their <i>Guide</i> entry is complete. As well, all 
              Members are registered in electronic mail distribution lists in 
              order to keep up-to-date of any new developments in the museum community 
              and to communicate with other members.&nbsp; 
            <p><a name="membersonmembership"></a><b><i>Members on Membership</i></b>&nbsp; 
            <p>For the most part the virtual museum community has understood and 
              embraced CHIN's concept of membership. However, a number of institutions 
              have voiced concern that membership involves membership fees and 
              are therefore reluctant to participate in anything that will remove 
              more funds from their stretched-too-thin budgets. Once they understand 
              that no fees are involved in becoming a CHIN Member and that they 
              actually will receive free perks as an incentive, they become very 
              enthusiastic about the <i>Guide</i> and about CHIN. These new Members 
              have become ardent supporters of CHIN and have begun to spread the 
              word to their colleagues about the benefits of participating in 
              the <i>Guide</i>. Indeed, a number of requests that have come into 
              CHIN for <i>Guide</i> information have been via referrals from institutions 
              already in the <i>Guide</i>.&nbsp; 
            <p><a name="validity"></a><b><i>Validity of 'Membership'</i></b>&nbsp; 
            <p>CHIN is currently reviewing its Member categories and guidelines 
              as well as the term 'Membership' itself. Is the term 'Membership' 
              valid? If one looks at the <i>Guide</i> or, for that matter, any 
              of CHIN's projects, there is a heavy investment on the part of all 
              'Members'. So much so that CHIN and its Members are truly partners 
              in these ventures.&nbsp; 
            <p>The term 'partner' sometimes has financial connotations associated 
              with it as does 'Membership' but those involved in a partnership 
              share both the risks and the profits of their business whereas Member 
              implies a more passive role. Other terms that could be considered 
              include 'associate' or 'collaborator'.&nbsp; 
            <p>Everyone involved in the <i>Guide</i> has a stake in its future 
              and whatever term is used, the goal is the same for all participants 
              - a successful product. CHIN wants to fulfill its mandate as being 
              the gateway to electronic heritage information and wants to provide 
              on-line visitors from around the world with a useful resource for 
              information on Canadian museums; museums want to reach new audiences, 
              increase attendance and increase revenues.&nbsp; 
            <p><a name="future"></a><b><i>Future Directions and Perceived Challenges</i></b>&nbsp; 
            <p>The future looks bright for the <i>Guide</i>. It will be getting 
              a facelift with a brand new, graphically pleasing, more user-friendly 
              look. Its focus will be expanding as it combines with the Canadian 
              Museums Association (CMA) Directory. This super <i>Guide</i> will 
              have basic information for the over 2000 heritage institutions in 
              Canada with expanded listings for those with <i>Guide</i> entries. 
              CHIN is very excited about this collaboration with the CMA and hopefully 
              this new <i>Guide</i> will be unveiled in late spring or early summer 
              1998.&nbsp; 
            <p>While optimism remains high for the implementation of the new and 
              improved <i>Guide</i>, CHIN will face its share of challenges along 
              the way. These will include getting more new Members, getting the 
              larger institutions to participate and proving the effectiveness 
              of the coupon program.&nbsp; 
            <p>To increase its Membership, CHIN must focus on all of the institutions 
              currently in the CMA Directory. The CMA Directory has basic information 
              such as institution name, address, telephone numbers, hours of operation, 
              special services/activities and brief collection information for 
              the over 2000 museums and galleries in Canada. Of this number, over 
              250 institutions have more detailed information in the <i>Guide</i> 
              including descriptions, events, images, and links to museums' own 
              Web sites. The challenge for CHIN, will be in trying to close the 
              gap between these two numbers, i.e., to have more information, especially 
              events information, for all museums in Canada thereby creating a 
              truly superior and impressive resource.&nbsp; 
            <p>One very important task that CHIN faces is to encourage the participation 
              of more of the larger institutions. Many of these institutions have 
              expended a great deal of time, energy and resources in an effort 
              to have very extensive, informative Web sites. Some have felt that 
              to do a <i>Guide</i> entry is a duplication of effort and therefore 
              have resisted becoming involved in the <i>Guide</i>. Even CHIN's 
              interim solution, discussed earlier, of a hybrid system of centralized 
              and distributed information has failed to convince some of the larger 
              institutions to participate. CHIN is active in pursuing the challenge 
              of convincing these institutions of the merits of this centralized 
              resource. At the same time, CHIN will continue to be an active participant 
              in the Consortium for the Computer Interchange of Museum Information 
              (CIMI). CIMI aims to develop the standards and tools to manage museum 
              information and to search across different hardware and software 
              in a distributed environment.&nbsp; 
            <p>Last but not least, CHIN wants to prove the effectiveness of the 
              coupon program as one means of marketing the <i>Guide</i>. As outlined 
              earlier, this program is meant to encourage visitors to the <i>Guide</i> 
              and help museums and CHIN track the use of the <i>Guide</i>. Museum 
              visitors can redeem their coupons for a CHIN gift and any other 
              gift or discount of the museum's choosing. Once they run out, museums 
              can then reorder their supply of the CHIN gift. So far, out of the 
              62 institutions participating in this program, no order forms have 
              come in. This is not to say that the program is not working - it 
              could be too early to tell - but CHIN will review the program to 
              see if this part of the <i>Guide</i> should be maintained.&nbsp; 
            <p><a name="summary"></a><b><i>Summary</i></b>&nbsp; 
            <p>The <i>Guide to Canadian Museums and Galleries</i> is what it is 
              today due to the successful collaboration between CHIN and its Member 
              museums. This virtual community of heritage professionals will continue 
              to work together to increase the profile of Canadian museums, nationally 
              and internationally, and to increase awareness of the Canadian public 
              to their cultural heritage through access to heritage information 
              virtually on the Internet. CHIN is proud that the <i>Guide</i> has 
              become one of its flagship products and will continue to maintain 
              its strong bonds with its Members and to forge new ones.&nbsp; <br>
