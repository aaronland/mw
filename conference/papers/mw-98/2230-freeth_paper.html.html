          <h4><a href="../../bios/freeth.html">Martin 
            Freeth</a>, Science World</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Inspired by the Exploratorium, the Bristol Exploratory pioneered 
              hands-on science in Britain. At the time this was the only interactive 
              kind of public education about science. 
              <p><i>Runs VHS video clip from Exploratory (30 secs), and describes 
                the Exploratory and how it was founded by Richard Gregory. Brought 
                interactivity into the science curriculum. Links to <a href="../http://www.exploratory.org.uk/"> 
                Exploratory web site </a> to illustrate.</i>
              <p> 
              <p>
            <li> On television, BBC Science in London with 'Horizon' (shown in 
              North America under the name 'Nova' through WGBH), and the BBC Natural 
              History Unit, based in Bristol, led the world in serious science 
              and nature programmes. 
              <p><i>Runs short 'Life on Earth' clip. Explains how Chris Parsons, 
                who made that series, conceived of both Wildscreen World and the 
                ARKive. Runs short video about the <a href="../http://arkive.uwe.ac.uk/"> 
                ARKive</a> and describes how it will work.</i>
              <p>
              <p>
            <li> On the science side, we are only just beginning to develop our 
              hands-on exhibits for the new Bristol centre. To add to the physical 
              interactivity established at the Exploratory, we'll also be developing 
              virtual reality exhibits, sometimes linked to simulators. It's not 
              too difficult to devise exhibits which illustrate Newtonian physics 
              - Einstein is a different matter. But in a virtual world you could, 
              for example, see what would happen if you changed the speed of light. 
              Would you get heavier? Would time slow down for you? Then, if you 
              used scaleable authoring software, we can provide small-scale versions 
              of such 3D environments on the web. 
              <p>
            <li> On the Internet, we also plan to provide a great deal of marketing 
              and educational material to complement what we shall be doing in 
              the building itself. For a visitor to Science World, the visit itself 
              should be like the jam in a sandwich: the bread each side (the educational 
              material) is what makes it worth eating. In this analogy the jam 
              represents the sweet experience of the actual visit.
              <p>
            <li> We plan to go live on line this year, more than a year before 
              the new centre actually opens. But we could scarcely do better than 
              the Exploratorium in San Francisco, the earliest science centre 
              of all, in creating a valuable and enjoyable web site. 
              <p><i>Illustrates with examples from <a href="../http://www.exploratorium.org/"> 
                Exploratorium web site</a></i>
              <p>
            <li> On-line generally, now that the costs of video-conferencing and 
              connecting via ISDN are falling so quickly, the opportunities are 
              fantastic.
              <p><i> Illustrates with short VHS tape of Irish music groups in 
                Dublin, Paris and New York playing on-line together on St Patrick's 
                Day.</i>
              <p> This was done nearly two years ago now, and soon everyone will 
                be able to play. 
              <p>
            <li> Using such technologies, we would like to combine real-science, 
              hands-on science and on-line links. For example, groups of kids 
              in the afternoons in Bristol could use a solar telescope to measure 
              the angle of the sun, while similar groups did the same thing in 
              the mornings in a Canadian science centre. If these groups were 
              linked with video phones or a video conferencing system, and shared 
              data with one another, they could really measure the circumference 
              of the earth. Given sunshine both sides of the Atlantic, what we 
              then have to work out of course is just how to schedule and manage 
              this sort of session. 
              <p>
            <li> We also plan to develop a science news room in Science World, 
              and we are working with the <a href="../http://www.uwe.ac.uk/"> University 
              of the West of England</a> as this idea is developed. In this project 
              we want to collaborate with many other centres because news content 
              is very expensive to develop, and because this will keep our visitors 
              in touch with the wider world. 
              <p><i>Illustrates with images from the news room project.</i>
              <p> We hope to have a rota of volunteer experts, available live 
                on-line to our visitors and ready to answer visitors' questions 
                (in text, audio, or video) about the news of the moment. 
              <p>
            <li> Like many other organisations, we shall also establish web cams 
              in many sites which are relevant to the exhibits and the resolution 
              and quality of web cam images will certainly improve during the 
              next two years before we open. So, for example, if visitors are 
              enjoying themselves building models of Isambard Brunel's bridges, 
              there'll be a live web cam on the Maidenhead bridge showing trains 
              passing over, and another on the Clifton bridge showing how the 
              structure out there in the real world flexes and moves as cars drive 
              over it. So we hope visitors will see the relevance of their models 
              as they make them. 
              <p><i> Illustrates with images of Brunel's bridges. Connects to 
                other web cams live. </i>
              <p> 
              <p>
            <li> Then, of course, as the Exploratorium site also illustrates, 
              the Internet is about feedback and shared experiences. There are 
              new kinds of environment for interaction on line. Some of them are 
              only used for personal chat and games just now, but they have a 
              lot of educational potential. 
              <p>
            <li> Here's an experiment we did together with British Telecom when 
              I was at the BBC Multimedia Centre, entitled 'The Mirror', linked 
              with a TV show called 'The Net'. 
              <p><i>Runs short tape illustrating <a href="../http://www.bbc.co.uk/"> 
                'The Mirror'</a>.</i>
              <p> The only problem was that all these early adopters wanted to 
                talk about was bugs in Internet Explorer! In my view, web sites 
                and on-line links must not be about digital technologies they 
                must meet other needs and interests.
              <p>
            <li> On-line links, combined with the convergence of television, computers, 
              telephony and museums, will certainly turn traditional television 
              and traditional education upside down by linking the world and by 
              giving people real choice through interactivity. 
              <p>
            <li> Here is another example of work which we developed at the BBC. 
              <p><i> Illustrates (using a PC CD-rom) examples of interactivity 
                from 'The Troubles', with its associated web site.</i>
              <p>
              <p>
            <li> So how will all this affect museums or science centres? Will 
              there be any point in coming to our buildings? Will an on-line virtual 
              world do just as well? I suggest that in fact a combination of real 
              and virtual worlds will be extremely powerful educationally. It 
              is not good enough just to tack web sites onto museums or add internet 
              cafes to science centres. But if museums keep ahead of the frontier 
              and recognise what they are good at, they really will be the jam 
              in the sandwich: the sweet emotional experience which makes the 
              intellectual bread digestible! That's why we have to keep up with 
              the latest developments: so we can go on doing things few people 
              can do at home. 
          </ul>
