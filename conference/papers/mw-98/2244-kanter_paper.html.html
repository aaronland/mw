            <h4><a href="../../bios/kanter.html">Norbert 
              Kanter</a>, Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland</h4>
            <p>&quot;School and Museum on the net&quot; is a cooperative educational 
              project between the highschool Clara-Schumann-Gymnasium and the 
              Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland in Bonn 
              (Art and Exhibition Hall of the Federal Republic of Germany) and 
              part of the national initiative &quot;Schulen ans Netz&quot;. It 
              was developed within the context of the exhibition &quot;Arktis-Antarktis&quot; 
              (&quot;Arctic-Antarctica&quot;, 12/19/1997 - 04/19/1998), a lively 
              presented exhibition with over 600 displayed objects in a gallery 
              space of 2.000 m2, covering art and cultural history as well as 
              discovery and exploration of the north and south polar regions. 
              Its goal was to learn about the impact of new media and communication 
              contexts for education. The paper presents the genesis of the project, 
              its planning, implementation and achievements with the involvment 
              of students, teachers and museum education and new media departments.</p>

            <p>&quot;Schulen ans Netz&quot; (&quot;Schools to the net!&quot;) 
              is an initiative of the German government in cooperation with the 
              German Telekom. The aim of this unprecendented &quot;public private 
              partnership&quot;, which took off in early '96, is to provide to 
              all highschool students the means to make creative use of networked 
              information systems and multimedia as &quot;... sensemaking valuable 
              acquisition instead of a 'media shower'.&quot; (Federal Minister 
              Dr. J&uuml;rgen R&uuml;ttgers, statement on the occasion of the 
              launch of &quot;Schulen ans Netz&quot;, 04/18/1996, Bonn). Starting 
              from the classrooms, this initative is a first step towards the 
              acquisition of skills that will enable students and teachers to 
              meet with the challenges of the information society and can be summarized 
              by the following activities:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Increase &quot;media literacy&quot; of students and teachers 
                <br>
                (&quot;media literacy&quot; as knowledge about media, <br>
                criticism of media, use of media, designing media)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Development of new communication and cooperation skills and 
                concepts for that</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Media appropriate production of school class material</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Use of online information resources for the classes <br>
                (databases, libraries)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>New definition of the role of teachers <br>
                (as moderator and mediator)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Awareness of the possibilities to improve learning skills through 
                international educational projects</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Furthermore &quot;Schulen ans Netz&quot; deals with &quot;media 
              literacy&quot;, &quot;media competence&quot; for students, the use 
              of internet and multimedia as addendum to learning content, the 
              broadening of the means of traditional learning and teaching methods. 
              Despite the fact that Germany possesses the most advanced ISDN infrastructure 
              and fibre optics network worldwide (statement of the German Telekom), 
              in matters of new media design and use for education and training 
              the advancements were not considerable until now.</p>
            <p>The project partners decided to connect 10.000 highschools to the 
              internet within three years and collected for this a budget of 60 
              million DM. Consequently approximately a quarter of all German schools 
              (44.000 in total) were able to receive at least one computer and 
              an ISDN internet connection to the <a href="../http://www.dfn.de/" target="_top">Deutsches 
              Forschungsnetzwerk (DFN)</a> (German Science Network, internet provider 
              for universities). The number of connection points to the Wissenschaftsnetz 
              (Science Network) should be increased in order to assure low telephone 
              line costs (unfortunately the German Telekom could not afford unlimited 
              free internet connection for all the schools).</p>
            <p>The association &quot;Schulen ans Netz&quot; was founded in order 
              to manage and administrate the project. A <a href="../http://www.san-ev.de/" target="_top">web 
              site</a> was created for the diffusion of the project reports and 
              latest news and developments. In addition to this &quot;national 
              equipment initiative&quot; which constitutes the &quot;entry level&quot;, 
              schools have also the possibility to develop their own proposals, 
              the so-called &quot;model projects&quot;. The &quot;model project&quot; 
              can go beyond the basic computer and software equipment by creating 
              a sophisticated and &quot;media appropriate&quot; concept for &quot;new 
              learning and teaching&quot;. It is also possible to include other 
              partners into this proposal.</p>
            <p>Besides the main sponsors - <a href="../http://www.bmbf.de/" target="_top">BMBF</a> 
              (Federal minister of Education, Science, Research and Technology) 
              and <a href="../http://www.dtag.de/" target="_top">Deutsche Telekom</a> 
              - <a href="../http://www.apple.de/" target="_top">Apple Computer Deutschland</a>, 
              the german magazine <a href="../http://www.stern.de/" target="_top">STERN</a> 
              as well as about 30 more sponsors (computer companies, publishers, 
              internet providers etc.) contributed significantly to &quot;Schulen 
              ans Netz&quot;.</p>
            <p>Today these efforts increased up to 6.500 the number of schools 
              with an internet connection (compared to only 500 in the beginning 
              of &quot;Schulen ans Netz&quot;). More than 200 &quot;model projects&quot; 
              were sponsored and more than a 1.000 courses for teacher's training 
              took place - last but not least: more than 1.700 schools created 
              their own homepage on the net.</p>
            <p>Although the project was initially planned to run on a three year 
              period, the partners have already agreed on its extension. Until 
              the year 2000 10.000 more schools should be connected to the net 
              through &quot;Schulen ans Netz&quot;.</p>

            <p>During autumn '96, teachers from the Clara-Schumann-Gymnasium and 
              representatives of the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle discussed for 
              the first time the possibilities to combine exhibition content, 
              museum education and curriculum in order to propose a &quot;model 
              projekt&quot; for the &quot;Schulen ans Netz&quot; initiative. The 
              forthcoming exhibition &quot;Arktis-Antarktis&quot;, scheduled to 
              open in december '97, could provide a perfect setting for the synthesis 
              of educational work within an exhibition and in connection with 
              the work in classrooms.</p>
            <p>Two teachers from the school were appointed &quot;project managers&quot;, 
              while at the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle the head of the education 
              department and the project manager for new media were in charge 
              of the new project. Together we have worked on the &quot;raw concept&quot; 
              of content and technology. In november '96 our joint proposal was 
              delivered to &quot;Schulen ans Netz&quot;.</p>
            <p>This kind of cooperation, between a highschool and a museum / exhibition 
              hall, was at that time completely new in Germany - and still remains. 
              However, the very good overall circumstances contributed to the 
              launching of such a collaboration. Since 1990 the Kunsthalle worked 
              extensively with computer, databases and networked applications, 
              while since '96 the activities in the field of new media increased 
              (web site online since 4th of july '96!). Within the Clara-Schumann-Gymnasium 
              committed teachers and enthousiastic students have shown a strong 
              will to experiment with new means of learning interaction (students 
              ages ranging from 11 to 19 years old).</p>

              curators as well as the exhibition designer participated actively 
              and contributed to the &quot;shaping&quot; of the concept. The 12-month 
              time span available for preparing the project helped to guarantee 
              the quality of the planning.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of '97 the partners received the unofficial message 
              from &quot;Schulen ans Netz&quot; according to which the project 
              proposal &quot;School and Museum on the net&quot; was accepted as 
              &quot;model project&quot; and furthermore, that Apple Germany was 
              going to support this project in particular. The Clara-Schumann-Gymnasium 
              was listed among the few &quot;Apple model schools&quot; in Germany. 
              However the official confirmation did not reach the partners until 
              autumn '97.</p>

            <p>&quot;New methods of mediation and a creative use of exhibition 
              content for school class purposes through the development of interactive 
              teaching and learning processes, with the help of networking between 
              highschool and museum, under the topic of the exhibition 'Arktis-Antarktis'&quot; 
              - these were the project headlines: this rather theoretical approach 
              had to be transformed into an every day practice. <br>
              <br>
              Consequently during the exhibition, the curricula of the different 
              courses were combined and merged with the <a href="#aus">exhibition 
              topics </a> (outlined since '95). In addition to that new ways of 
              learning and working by means of computer and multimedia had to 
              be invented, developed and tested. For this reason the school and 
              the museum were connected by multiple media. Relevant topics and 
              questions developed during the school courses, were transmitted 
              online to a so-called &quot;explorer group&quot; (a group of four 
              to six students) within the exhibition, where further research would 
              take place - and vice-versa. Decentralized simultaneous communication 
              and learning beyond the wall of classrooms and the 45 minute duration 
              of traditional school lessons took place within the exhibition and 
              the school. Themes from the exhibition were investigated and prepard 
              by the students during their art, geography, biology, physics, history, 
              chemistry, german and religion courses.</p>
            <p>An online connection between the two locations should have been 
              available at any time. Video conferencing and an ISDN line would 
              support the communication and delivery of data to the groups of 
              students.The multimedia content produced by the students would be 
              then edited and used for online publication. A number of &quot;up 
              to date cultural abilities&quot; within a new learning and communication 
              context should develop during the project: working and thinking 
              beyond the borders of a single school course, collaboration between 
              students of different age, group working outside the school, acquisition 
              of multimedia techniques and skills, communication through internet 
              with students of other schools, researchers and scientists.</p>

            <p>A special place in the school served as &quot;internet room&quot;: 
              ten Apple Macintosh computers as well as other devices such as printer, 
              scanner, ISDN router and internet connection (supposed to be installed 
              by Apple) would allow twenty students to work at the same time. 
              Within the Kunsthalle the idea and concept of the exhibition were 
              revised and the &quot;Polar Lab&quot;, a special room assigned to 
              this project, was created. The ISDN line and the connection to the 
              fibre optics network of the LAN were to be established as well as 
              the conditions to connect five computers to the internet through 
              the LAN.<br>
              <br>
              The &quot;Polar Lab&quot; was integrated into the exhibition in 
              a way to allow on one hand the &quot;explorer groups&quot; to use 
              the room for their project work and on the other hand to provide 
              access to the internet connection, to the polar library and the 
              relevant map material for the public and other school classes visiting 
              the exhibition. The museum education department employed university 
              students as &quot;polar lab assistants&quot; in order to answer 
              questions of visitors and pupils as well as work as to &quot;keep 
              an eye&quot; on the polar library and the computers.<br>

            <p>It is worth mentioning, that other &quot;research facilities&quot;and 
              mulitmedia installations were implemented for the exhibition, concurrently 
              with the &quot;Polar Lab&quot;, the public internet terminals and 
              a library concerning &quot;Arktis-Antarktis&quot;. With significant 
              funding from the EU Info 2000 program, the &quot;Interactive Polar 
              Theatre&quot; was developed. It shows unique high definition visualisations 
              of satellite data from the poles. In collaboration with the <a href="../http://www.awi-bremerhaven.de/AWI/KAH97/index.html" target="_top">Alfred-Wegener-Institut 
              for Polar Research</a> in Bremerhaven, additional internet services 
              were created: &quot;Animal Tracking&quot; and &quot;Questions and 
              Answers&quot;.</p>
            <p>&quot;Animal Tracking&quot; shows a daily updated exact position 
              of a large number of animals (polar bears, albatross, seals) in 
              the arctic and the antarctica. The animals are carrying transmitters, 
              which send their position data through satellite to the AWI, where 
              they are visualized automatically on maps and diffused on the internet. 
              &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; is another service proposed during 
              the exhibition. Students, teachers and interested people can ask 
              questions to scientists of the AWI. The &quot;professional&quot; 
              answers are posted in one or two days term on the internet.<br>

            <p>The first problems occurred during autumn '97: several months had 
              passed without an official contract between the main sponsor (Apple 
              Computer) and the office of &quot;Schulen ans Netz&quot;. Consequently 
              any delivery of hardware and software was impossible. The first 
              computers arrived only a few weeks before the opening of the exhibition. 
              This lead to the loss of a certain &quot;knowledge lead&quot; of 
              teachers and museum personnel. According to the original schedule 
              it was planned to have enough time to get familiar with hardware 
              and software and to test out the video conferencing possibilities. 
              During the following months the project was more and more compromised 
              by the difficulties of Apple to deliver the necessary equipment 
              and by the problems which occurred with the delivered equipment.<br>

            <p align="CENTER"><img src="schema.gif" alt="configuration scheme"></p>
            <p>Only since march '98, short before the end of the current project 
              phase (i.e. the closing of the exhibition in april '98) and not 
              five months earlier as intended, the above shown configuration could 
              be established. Until then it was impossible to connect by video 
              conferencing the &quot;explorer group&quot; with the students at 
              the Clara-Schumann-Gymnasium. The transfer of image and text data 
              between the two locations over the dedicated ISDN line became possible 
              working only some weeks ago. Therefore it was necessary to revise 
              the methods of group working: &quot;explorer groups&quot; entered 
              the exhibition, worked with the objects, the polar library and the 
              internet, produced digital images and texts which later, in the 
              school, were processed and published on the website.</p>

            <p>Students of all classes (5th to 13th grade, age 11 to 19) are still 
              involved in the project. Until now the Clara-Schumann-Gymnasium 
              carried out 25 internal teacher seminars concerning internet. Approximately 
              60% of all teachers had at least a first contact with the medium 
              internet. Equally 60 % of all students had the opportunity to work 
              with the internet during the project period and formed three internet 
              working groups. Seven projects were developed for the website within 
              the &quot;School and Museum on the net&quot; initiative, three of 
              them being already completed and accessible to everyone. A relative 
              project, inspired by the &quot;Arktis-Antarktis&quot; exhibition, 
              was developed by the students of the department of Biology of the 
              University of Bonn. The works of the students are available through

            <p>All involved members in the project &quot;School and Museum on 
              the net&quot; learned a lot - unfortunately not only in the sense 
              meant initially by the project, but also in handling computer problems 
              and dealing with computer companies. Again and again a lot of time 
              and energy was wasted in order to maintain the equipment. The fact 
              that Apple has not been able until today to provide support for 
              &quot;Schulen ans Netz&quot;, resulted in a slow development of 
              the project and possibly affected the quality of the output. It 
              is only now that the project runs in a way it should have been from 
              the beginning. Additionally other topics, like coordination of working 
              groups and &quot;explorer groups&quot;, collaboration beyond the 
              regular course hours, additional support and time teachers had to 
              invest, were new to most of the involved parties and lead to many 
              new experiences.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless the work produced by the students during the last 
              months is remarkable. Thirty &quot;explorer groups&quot; worked 
              within the Polar Lab and in the exhibition for several hours. The 
              high number of project related classes at the highschool showed 
              the involvement of the students and the creative use of multimedia 
              (e.g. exploring the aurora phenomenon, a group of students composed 
              and performed a piece of music in order to create an acoustic impression 
              of this phenomenon. The sound material was digitized and used for 
              the aurora pages on the project's website). The teachers are considering 
              the results as a first success in working with new media. During 
              the different learning and teaching experiences several contacts 
              were established by teachers and students: collaborations with the 
              Computer Center of the University of Bonn, the Institute for Mathematics 
              and Computing GMD in St. Augustin, the Central Office for Agricultural 
              Documentation and Information in Bonn and the above mentioned Alfred-Wegener-Institut 
              in Bremerhaven.</p>
            <p>For the Kunsthalle it was clear from the beginning, that - despite 
              this new approach - the traditional museum education work with guided 
              tours, publications and workshops would continue also during &quot;Arktis-Antarktis&quot;. 
              Even more, the above mentioned &quot;polar lab assistants&quot; 
              have intensively contributed to inform and help the 160.000 visitors 
              of the exhibition, while the museum education department carried 
              out ca. 1.000 guided tours within &quot;Arktis-Antarktis&quot; - 
              the highest number of guided tours ever recorded for an exhibition 
              in the Kunsthalle.</p>

            <p>A detailed evaluation phase will follow the completion of the project: 
              concept and results will be compared. These informations will be 
              published and used in future projects. The first steps are already 
              taken for a follow-up project. On march 16th another scientific 
              exhibition opened at the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle: &quot;<a

href="../http://www.kah-bonn.de/1/19/0e.htm" target="_top">Gene Worlds</a>&quot; 
              - an exhibition about science, research, problems and future developments 
              of gene technology and equally appropriate for educational purposes. 
              The long duration of this exhibition (until january 1999) is reason 
              enough to hope, that the implications of technology will have a 
              less strong impact, than in the actual case.</p>
            <p>The efforts to develop new ways of mediation whithin the context 
              of learning and education influenced all the parties of the project. 
              Finally, if the means and tools work properly, the use of internet 
              can vary and enrich learning and teaching interaction and contribute 
              to achieve &quot;media literacy&quot;. For the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle 
              and the Clara-Schumann-Gymnasium the exploration of new contexts 
              of communication was a fullfilling experience as well as a very 
              positive first step.</p>
