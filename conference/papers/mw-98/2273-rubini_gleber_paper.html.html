          <p> My presentation is on the development of the <b> On Line Learning 
            Environment (OLE)</b>, a virtual fieldtrip of The Museum of Art and 
            the Odyssey Science Center that is available on the Internet. It was 
            developed using interactive 3-D software and sound/video transmission 
            technologies. 
          <p> The OLE web site is a prototype and coincides with the opening of 
            the Capital Cultural Center - in Tallahassee, Florida. The Cultural 
            Center is the permanent home of the Odyssey Science Center and the 
            Museum of Art and will offer visitors an interdisciplinary experience, 
            a journey into the world of art, science, mathematics and technology 
            in an environment created with traveling and permanent exhibits, workshops 
            and interactive educational experiences of art. It is here science 
            and art will behave as partners in the manifestation of human creativity. 
            The <b> On Line Learning Environment</b> extends the experience of 
            the Cultural Center's activities in an educational and entertaining 
            way to people who cannot visit the museums.

          <p>My interest in the museum project began as an active member of the 
            Tallahassee community who recognized a need for a museum in our city, 
            but not as simply another box to display things in, but rather as 
            an edifice for learning and exploring. As the building plans began 
            to take shape, it became apparent that a web presence was going to 
            become an intregal component of the museum. The term virtual edifice 
            denotes at the simplest interpretation of a building that is experienced 
            but not physically felt. It is made up of the word virtual borrowed 
            from the technology of virtual reality, or VR. VR is a class of computer 
            controlled multisensory communication technologies that allow more 
            intuitive interactions with data and involve human senses interactively 
            together. It is a tool or a strategy to experience information and 
            thereby assist learning.... and be extremely enteraining. Edifice 
            is the place that one enters to connect with their own culture, beliefs 
            and myths. In a general sense it is a space defined by architecture 
            that houses the information, knowledge and beliefs of a culture. It's 
            role is built on its function as a symbol but it manifests much more. 
            . Years pass in the making of structures that edify society. Museums 
            have been such places and virtual museums on the web represent the 
            beginning of a new edifice.</p>
          <p>What we as educators must do is be aware of technology that can assist 
            learning. The internet promises to be the quantum leap from present 
            to future edifice. Even so, much of what we see as the future is still 
            in the future. Most websites put up for the delivery of educational 
            content are designed as a virtual type of book. Predominately linear 
            and text driven, many web sites serve as both newsletter and catalogue 
            for the museum. The potential for the web is its ability to deliver 
            multi-sensory learning experiences to the viewer who may explore, 
            define, discover and construct their own learning. The <b> On Line 
            Learning Environment</b> used a multiple visual interface to quickly 
            get the viewers interest. Each page of the site was divided into component 
            interfaces including sound, single pictures, video and VR environments.The 
            VR environments functioned as the roadway to other places, to other 
            sites, or other databases. The concept behind using a VR environment 
            is the development of "nodes" which refer to a point and click method 
            of quickly going somewhere else. In this case, once you have entered 
            the museum, VR environments gets you quickly to the exhibition you 
            are interested in, gets you to see the exhibition, gets you to hear 
            about the exhibition, specific exhibit, or interact with the exhibit 
            and gets you to additional sites and specific educational programing. 
          </p>
          <p> The potential of the web is to deliver multi-sensory learning experiences 
            to the viewer who may explore, define, discover and construct their 
            own "exhibiton." <b>The On Learning Environment</b> will create a 
            virtual Cultural Center with virtual exhibitions, interactive access 
            to virtual exhibits and people within the Capital Cultural Center 
            and a template for further virtual tours. Piqued by interesting 3-D 
            environments, a visitor will have opportunities to explore exhibition 
            areas. The programs of the Museum of Art and Odyssey Science Center 
            will serve as an "extended exhibition" for visitors via the World 
            Wide Web. The use of sound and video streaming will serve as both 
            an instructor and museum guide as you go through the virtual experience. 
            The hypertext format makes it possible to merge art and science in 
            ways that bridge the disciplines and demonstrate the multiple connections 
            between exhibits. Telecommunication technology will allow visitors 
            to interact in real time with people and exhibits at the Cultural 
            Center. The virtual exhibits can also be "linked" to applicable hands-on 
            activities and a searchable archive of hands-on resources which can 
            used to supplement or replace existing activities. Frequent Internet 
            broadcasts of lecturers, demonstrations, video conferencing and interactive 
            exhibitions will serve to extend the exhibition.</p>
          <p> The <b>On-Line Learning Environment</b> is a demonstration for how 
            cultural institutions can integrate resources by using technologies 
            that expand their activities with minimal costs. Links to other local 
            points of interest can include other facilities. In Tallahassee for 
            example, it will include: The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, 
            the FSU Super Computer Computations Research Institute, the FAMU Observatory, 
            the FSU Planetarium, the FSU Nuclear Physics Lab and the Appleton 
            Museum.The web site is a model to explore cultural resources and use 
            them to anchor other activities. Interactive hands-on visual resources 
            are suddenly available to everyone connected. The site is to be more 
            than text linked information in the style of classical hyper text 
            environments. We are trying to develop a true hyper media environment. 
          <p><img src="3RDFLOOR_VR_ME.jpeg" width=440 height=96>
          <p> 
          <p> In addition the <b>On-Line Learning Environment</b> will create 
            a virtual archive of exhibitions and pre- and post- visit activities 
            to expand life beyond the one time exhibition. The virtual cultural 
            center will improve public access of science and art exhibitions by 
            offering interactive exhibits, workshops, demonstrations, and special 
            events to improve the understanding of art and science. The site offers 
            a view of the museum in the 21st century. No longer will there be 
            one exhibition, one guide, one catalogue or even one topic at a time. 
            The future museum will be a multi-layered and diverse environment 
            reflective of our society. The viewer will experience the exhibition 
            through a combination of reading, writing, seeing, hearing and feeling 
            both at the site and virtually.The exhibiton will be a unique blend 
            of gathering, sorting, and recreating and reflecting to create an 
            active audience of repeat visitors. 
          <p> <b>On Line Learning Environment</b> prototype used several technologies. 
            These technologies, some of which can be down-loaded at no cost from 
            a Web browser are HTML, VRML, Java-scripting, speech synthesis, and 
            robotics control via Web pages. Most internet users have web browsers 
            and are able to take full advantage of these standards for hyper media. 
          <p> The Cultural Center's <b>On Line Learning Environment</b> addresses 
            the need to find a way to keep visitors motivated and interested in 
            the activities of the Center. The virtual exhibits will allow the 
            patron to become familiar with the exhibitions before they arrive. 
            The <b>On Line Learning Environment</b> in conjunction with the programs 
            at the Center will be used as a guide to the exhibitions and a new 
            exhibition to explore. It will allow the visitors to return to explore 
            the exhibits in virtual space, share or report on the actual visit. 
            Presenting the exhibition in different forms reinforces the exhibition. 
            Experiencing the exhibition using different senses makes new connections 
            and naturally expands learning through exploration. Please visit the
