            <p>In 1995, the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) chose the 
              Southern Illinois University Museum at Carbondale (SIUC Museum) 
              to be one of four Illinois museums or consortia to be awarded grant 
              funds to participate in the technology-based, <b>"Museum in the 
              Classroom" </b>project. Since then, ISBE has not only added four 
              more museums or consortia, but there are now 258 schools throughout 
              Illinois working with these museums to integrate museum artifacts 
              and technology into their curriculum. (<b>See Table 1 for the names 
              and locations of museums</b>) For school year 1998-1999, ISBE plans 
              to continue this grant project by offering 60 schools and three 
              museums the opportunity to participate.</p>

            <p>This paper focuses on the 35 Illinois schools who chose to work 
              with the SIUC Museum from Fall 1995 to the present. Particular attention

              to other museums. Before we discuss these Museum-school partnerships, 
              attention has to be given to the overall <b>"Museum in the Classroom" 
              </b>project and the relationship between the several agencies involved 
              and their own project goals and strategies.</p>

            <p><b><i>Illinois State Board of Education</i></b></p>
            <p>"Effective July 1, 1995, Public Act 89-21 created the School Technology 
              Program and authorized the Illinois State Board of Education to 
              increase the quantity and quality of student and educator access 
              to the on-line resources, experts and capabilities of Illinois museums. 
              Through the use of technology and telecommunications, learning will 
              be extended beyond the four walls of the classroom, allowing students 
              access to the wealth of history, artifacts and fine art of Illinois' 
              museums. The project also advances the State Board of Education's 
              technology policy direction." (ISBE, 1997:1) (<a href="#appendixa"><b>Appendix 
              A</b></a>: Illinois State Board of Education 1995 Technology Policies) 
              The <b>"Museum in the Classroom" </b>grant project is a product 
              of the School Technology Program and was developed to:</p>
            <p><b>--Use the unique resources of Illinois' museums to enhance classroom 
              instruction through authentic and engaged learning.</b> Students 
              are encouraged to explore their world through interactions with 
              museum collections and subject matter experts (i.e., authentic learning). 
              Through this interaction students take an active role as researchers 
              (i.e., engaged learning) exploring the arts, sciences and humanities 
              using higher-order thinking skills (e.g., problem-solving, inquiry, 
              analysis, reasoning and invention).</p>
            <p><b>--Use the Internet as a means to share museum collections for 
              effective classroom use. </b>Emphasis is placed on the use of museum 
              collections as the primary resource for enriching curriculum and 
              developing project Websites.</p>
            <p><b>--Use computer technology to develop project Web pages that 
              include on-line digitized images and documents. </b>The final on-line 
              projects reflect the incorporation of technology-related components 
              achieved through technological literacy and hands-on practice.</p>
            <p><b>--Allow schools to obtain connectivity within the classroom.</b> 
              A connectivity grant is available for those schools who have inadequate 
              (at least a 56 kb connection) or no connection to the Internet.</p>

              The resulting projects would not only present on-line digitized 
              images and documents, but also should include coherent learning

            <p>The University Museum became involved in the <b>"Museum in the 
              Classroom"</b> project to facilitate the responsible use of the 
              Museum's collection in supplementing and strengthening the curriculum 
              brought forth by the students and teachers involved in the project. 
              The <b>"Museum in the Classroom"</b> project has allowed the Museum 
              to create relationships with public schools from all parts of the 
              State of Illinois through the collaboration with teachers and students 
              on the content/subject matter areas of their Web projects as well 
              as through technical and Web design instruction. To differentiate 
              from the overall ISBE project and to develop a sense of community 
              among our schools, we call our participating students and teachers, 
              <b>"Museum Explorers." </b>This project name embodies the project's 
              focus, which is to allow students of all grade levels to become 
              researchers as they explore selected subjects or topics such areas 
              as geology, anthropology, ethnobotany, paleontology, archaeology, 
              fine arts and history while making use of museum materials, expertise 
              and research facilities. The final product is an interactive, creative, 
              academic and informative Website.</p>
            <p><b>--Give students access to object-centered or authentic learning 
              to stimulate diverse problem solving learning situations. </b>The 
              project offers the Museum a means to add a new dimension to collection 
              usage. As researchers, students are able to augment traditional 
              methods of research using primary sources--artifacts, information 
              and subject matter experts. This type of educational situation lends 
              itself to student and teacher participation and is referred to as 
              engaged learning. The Museum's main educational objective for the 
              <b>"Museum in the Classroom"</b> project was to create engaged learning 
              opportunities for the students and teachers involved as <b>Museum 
              Explorers</b>. This meant that the Museum had to create an environment 
              where there was student-teacher interaction, collaboration, and 
              emphasis on using technology as a tool for learning. Some indicators 
              that engaged learning is taking place among students include collaboration, 
              strategic thinking, as well as responsible learning (students take 
              responsibility of their own learning) and energized learning (students 
              seem to be energized by the act of learning.) While visiting the 
              Museum, students and teachers were asked to work together toward 
              focusing their topic for the project as well as choosing artifacts 
              to be digitally photographed and used on their project Website. 
              This type of collaboration between students as well as students 
              and teachers was conducive to much creativity. This collaboration 
              allowed the projects to take shape through student driven exploration 
              of artifacts. All involved took part in strategic thinking by walking 
              through the basic development of their Website. Teachers were encouraged 
              to allow students to take responsibility for the choice, research 
              and photography of artifacts as well as the creation and follow 
              through of the school project. The energy was contagious - even 
              the Museum staff became energized by this engaged learning process.</p>
            <p><b>--Demonstrate creativity across disciplines.</b> The SIUC Museum 
              views the <b>"Museum in the Classroom"</b> project as a chance to 
              share its diverse collection. The arts, humanities and sciences 
              are available for integration into projects determined by participating 
              schools with an emphasis on cross-discipline usage.</p>
            <p><b>--Produce Web pages for the Internet that reflects curriculum. 
              </b>The Museum allows the students and teachers the flexibility 
              to integrate our resources into their existing education programs 
              allowing for a "good fit" between the school and the Museum.</p>
            <p><b>--Extend Museum outreach to a "cyber-audience" through a Museum 
              Website, school projects, and the development of an on-line catalog.</b> 
              The Internet allows the Museum the means to post information on 
              Museum programs and services, and collection information obtained 
              through school Web projects. An added information source will be 
              our on-line catalog that is currently being compiled.</p>
            <p><b>--Revitalize the use of Museum Loan Program materials.</b> Since 
              the 1970s, the Museum has had a collection of loan kits available 
              for use by schools and community groups. The <b>"Museum in the Classroom"</b> 
              project has allowed us to revitalize their use by extending the 
              lending of the materials throughout Illinois to our partner schools. 
              Students are able to use these information resources that have holdings 
              in the arts, humanities and sciences and include actual objects 
              and/or slide programs.</p>
            <p>Each of these organization's goals were identified through the 
              granting process. <b>ISBE </b>delineated their project goals through 
              the Request for Proposals (RFP)&nbsp;that has been sent each year 
              since 1995, to Illinois school district superintendents and public 
              schools principals, as well as museums. <b>Illinois schools</b> 
              and <b>museums </b>were able to express their project goals through 
              completion and submission of the RFP, and had the opportunity to 
              realize their goals if funded.</p>

            <p>When the original grant was submitted in 1995, the Museum worked 
              in partnership with SIUC's Broadcasting Services. The Museum's role 
              was to concentrate on subject matter development, and Broadcasting's 
              role was to focus on technology issues. For subject matter topics, 
              the Museum decided on three areas: 1. <b>Fine Arts</b>,<b> </b>2. 
              <b>Paleontology</b>, and 3. <b>Illinois History</b>. However, at 
              the first meeting when all 99 funded schools were trying to decide 
              who they wanted as their museum partner, we felt our original topics 
              had to be modified to meet each school's needs. This reasoning was 
              based on the following: 1. The learning of the new technology was 
              perceived to be so intense that to have a school/teacher develop 
              a new curriculum to meet our topics would be an overload., and 2. 
              To truly be a partner with each school, we needed to work with them 
              to integrate resources into existing or already planned curriculum. 
              This shift in the Museum's original focus allowed us to adopt the 
              use of engaged learning as a means for schools to develop their 
              projects with the Museum. Fexibility became the key word for the 
              project and continues to be the guiding concept as we work with 
              old and new schools to develop projects that integrate artifacts 
              and technology.</p>

              Development</u></b></font></p>
            <p>To develop school projects, both ISBE and the Museum used several 
              strategies:</p>
            <p>--<b>Technical training in the use of computer hardware, software, 
              digital camera and videoconferencing. </b>Throughout the <b>"Museum 
              in the Classroom" </b>project, <b>ISBE</b> provided training sessions 
              for teachers and students, and museum staff. These regional trainings 
              are provided by the Technology HUB in which that school or museum 
              is located (Note: ISBE has the state divided up into seven HUBs).</p>
            <p><b>In Year I,</b> during each school's visit to the <b>SIUC Museum, 
              </b>the expertise of SIUC's Broadcasting Services staff was used 
              to supplement the HUB's technical training for teachers and students.This 
              was based in part by the fact many teachers/students were non-Macintosh 
              users and had to develop this familiarity first. <b>In Year III, 
              </b>the Museum has dedicated part of the two-day school visits to 
              technical training by Museum staff on Adobe Photoshop 4.0, Web page 
              design, and Apple's Authoring Studio through hands-on learning by 
              students who take images of Museum artifacts they have chosen for 
              their project. Broadcasting Services continues to work with the 
              Museum as a resource on technical issues.</p>
            <p>--The <b>primary goal of the technical training</b> is to instill 
              confidence in using technology through developing and enhancing 
              technology skills and creating a fundamental knowledge of Website 
              design and construction. This is accomplished through demonstrations, 
              dialogue, and actual "hands on" experience. During their visit, 
              students and teachers attend 2 technology workshops conducted by 
              the Museum Webmaster. During these workshops they learn what the 
              key aspects of a photographic image are and, using Photoshop 4.0, 
              the 6 steps that are necessary to make the minimum corrections required 
              for a Web ready image. They are: opening, cropping, lighting, sharpening, 
              resolution, and saving a file.</p>
            <p>--<b>Creativity is an essential</b> component in designing and 
              creating graphic images. In addition to these 6 steps and as time 
              allows the Webmaster also demonstrates some of the more advanced 
              tools in Photoshop which can be used to add elements like type, 
              combine separate images using copy and paste commands, changing 
              the color of a background using hue and saturation, and applying 
              filters. However, we do not expect them to remember the specifics 
              of using these tools but rather using this time as an opportunity 
              to encourage their creativity and open up the possibilities of the 
              software.</p>
            <p>--<b>"Hands on" training</b> is conducted during the second day 
              workshop. We begin by readdressing the steps from the first session. 
              Asking for student or teacher volunteers to actually demonstrate 
              those steps using the images taken the day before. This "hands-on" 
              experience is very important. Usually it is the students that feel 
              most comfortable with the technology will be the ones to volunteer 
              and will also be the ones to visually guide the project when they 
              return to their schools. This in no way diminishes the importance 
              of the other students or teachers attending the workshops as this 
              training not only demonstrates the software but also illustrates 
              the technical issues of the Internet. Having this understanding 
              will not only teach them the language to discuss the project but 
              a basic understanding of the technology is in order for them to 
              make decisions on the overall design.</p>
            <p>--After the volunteers have completed their images with much laughter 
              and encouragement from their fellow students and teachers we take 
              the images we created in the 2 workshops and <b>construct a Web 
              page</b> using Claris Home page 3.0. This software program is very 
              intuitive and easily navigated. We begin by adding text, the images 
              we created, and links to other documents and URLs. We also explain 
              how to use such features as spell check, placing background patterns, 
              and the way Claris Home page can estimate the download time of a 
              Web page. We end our second day by examining the HTML code we "wrote" 
              while creating our Webpages and answering any questions that they 
              may have.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>--A visit by each school to the Museum to discover art and artifacts 
              that can be used to develop and implement their project. </b>Through 
              the <b>"Museum in the Classroom" </b>project, ISBE was able to turn 
              its attention to authentic and engaged learning initiatives. Funded 
              schools visited with their partner museum to identify resources 
              that could be used to develop on-line projects. Since its founding 
              in 1869, the <b>SIUC Museum</b> has collected over 52,000 artifacts 
              and related information in the arts, humanities and sciences. These 
              resources were used by <b>Museum Explorers </b>to develop their 
              project and illustrate Web pages.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Museum Explorers tour the entire archive to allow them to 
                experience the entire collection, not just the artifacts pertaining 
                to the specifc topic they had chosen. During this tour, the teachers 
                and students were given time to examine objects and ask questions. 
                They are also charged with deciding upon artifacts which they 
                are interested in researching and photographing. It was the research 
                and digital photography of artifacts which allowed the teachers 
                and students to begin work on their webpages when they returned 
                home.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>In addition to the technical training and on-site visit, the 
              Museum developed several other strategies to aid project development.</b></p>
            <p><b>--School Visits.</b> To develop a face-to-face communication 
              with students to maintain project development momentum and videoconferencing, 
              Museum staff visited with project schools.</p>
            <p><b>--Summer Teacher Institutes in Project Development and Advanced 
              Technical Training</b>. Each summer the Museum offers project teachers 
              the opportunity to attend workshops that are aimed at stimulating 
              future projects by giving them the means to understand the methods 
              and processes involved in creating and interpreting museum collections, 
              and advanced technical training.</p>
            <p><b>--Museum Explorers Resource Library.</b> In 1997, the Museum 
              began to purchase books and videos that covered a range of topics 
              from use of the Internet in the classroom to children's books that 
              related to our collection. The development of the library was a 
              result of the discovery made in Year I, in that many schools did 
              not have access to current information about their topic, and materials 
              in the Museum's resource collection were academic in nature and 
              not suitable for younger grades. Library materials can be checked-out 
              by participating schools and are circulated free-of-charge by the 
              Illinois library system.</p>
            <p><b>--Museum and School Evaluation</b>. Evaluation of the project 
              has occurred at several levels: ISBE, museums, and schools. In Year 
              I (1995-1996), ISBE used the Center for Children and Technology 
              (New York, New York) to evaluate all of four of its On-Line Curriculum 
              Projects--<b>Museum in the Classroom Project, </b>Illinois Student 
              Project Information Network, EnergyNet, and Tried and True.(For 
              a summary of findings for the <b>"Museum in the Classroom Project" 
              </b>see<b> </b><a href="#appendixb">Appendix B</a>.)</p>
            <p>Each project museum has also been responsible for evaluation. Through 
              its three year involvement with the project, the SIUC Museum has 
              used the services of SIUC'sApplied Research Consultants (ARC) to 
              administer the project evaluation. This evaluation has consisted 
              of the application of a pre- and posttest survey which measured 
              the perceived computer/ technology/ Internet comfort levels of all 
              participants before and after project participation. The schools 
              were required to conduct two types of evaluations. The first was 
              a formative evaluation which measured the extent of achievement 
              of project objectives and the second was a summative evaluation 
              which assessed how participation in the <b>"Museum in the Classroom"</b> 
              project improved student and teacher technical knowledge and skill 
              along with any changes in learning,classroom organization and instruction. 
              Both the Museum and the schools use the Website Evaluation form 
              (or a customized version) to evaluate the Website both before and 
              after it is published on the WWW. (Please see <a href="#appendixc">Appendix 
              C</a> for an example of the Website Evaluation form.) Museum staff 
              continually evaluate the processes involved in the project making 
              changes to insure that the methods used to develop a school's Website 
              are viable. (For a summary of findings from Year I and Year II, 
              please see <a href="#appendixd">Appendix D</a> and <a href="#appendixe">Appendix 
              E</a>.)</p>
            <p>As part of the proposal process, each school was asked how they 
              would evaluate the project's effectiveness. Each funded school reported 
              their evaluation findings in the grant's final report submitted 
              to ISBE at the end of the project.</p>

            <p>Upon completion of school projects, the Museum staff reviewed the 
              Website projects and discovered that schools used several strategies 
              to achieve their final on-line project. These strategies included: 
              the use of nontraditional resources for information, the use of 
              compare and contrast, the use of methods to understand our world 
              community, and the opportunity for others to "use" their project

              Project and Its Application to Other Museums</u></b></font></p>
            <p>All or parts of the basic concept of the project is applicable 
              to any museum. The extent to which it is developed depends on the 
              availability of technical resources and staff time, and school interests. 
              Listed below are associated questions that have been answered in 
              the context of this project.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>What equipment do I need?</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>--<b>Computer:</b> Power Macintosh or IBM compatible (150 mhz 
                or above); RAM: 64 megabytes or higher is recommended for the 
                software programs that are used;<br>
                --<b>Camera:</b> Web page photographs can be obtained in several 
                ways: "flex" camera, video camera, digital camera, and through 
                the use of traditional photography (a scanner is needed to digitize 
                these photographs)<br>
                --<b>Panoramas:</b> A tripod is needed with a tilt-pan head to 
                keep the digital camera level while taking photographs. This insures 
                that when the panorama is stitched together, the resulting image 
                will be smooth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;<b>What software do I need?</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>--<b>Web pages: </b>Adobe PageMill or Claris Home Page is recommended 
                for "canned" Web pages. A basic knowledge of HTML can give Web 
                page design freedom through a text editor program.<br>
                --<b>QTVR: </b>QuickTime Virtual Reality is readily available 
                for the Macintosh through Apple's QuickTime VR Authoring Studio 
                software. Adobe Photoshop 4.0 is recommended for manipulating 
                images.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Do I have to be connected to the Internet?</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>--Yes,</b> if you and your schools want to use the Internet 
                for research or if you want to share your resources with others.<br>
                <b>--No,</b> you can still use any of the software to do a Website. 
                However, this Website will reside only in your computer (or local 
                network if you have one), and it will not be on the World Wide 
                Web.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Does the project take a lot of staff time?</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>--The basic <b>"Museum in the Classroom" </b>project requires 
                a lot of staff time to work with the number of schools that we 
                have in the preparation and conducting of school visits, communication 
                with schools to insure project progress (through e-mail, FAX, 
                snail mail, and telephone), and assisting them in obtaining project 
                information. To minimize this, a museum might want to scale down 
                the program to only a few schools.<br>
                --The development of our on-line catalog is time consuming. To 
                attain our long-term project and Museum goal of collection accessibility, 
                the <b>"Museum in the Classroom"</b> project gave us the opportunity 
                to begin to realize it. Project staff have been hired to digitize 
                our collection and create computerized catalog cards. This on-line 
                catalog will broaden our resources. Upon completion of certain 
                collections, it is hoped that an on-line curriculum can be developed 
                to make our collection usable as a school resource.</li>

            <p><a name=conclusion></a><font size="+1"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></font></p>
            <p>The <b>"Museum in the Classroom"</b> project has allowed select 
              Illinois museums to develop school partnerships that extend museum 
              resources into the classroom. These museum-school partnerships apply 
              technology in school projects that are influenced by these resources 
              and use the Internet as not only a research tool, but as a means 
              to share their own projects with others. Through the museum-school 
              partnerships, the Illinois State Board of Education, Illinois schools, 
              and SIUC Museum continue to realize project goals.</p>
            <p>For the SIUC Museum, the <b>"Museum in the Classroom"</b> project 
              has given us the opportunity to use our art, humanities and science 
              collections as a means to enhance Illinois school curriculum. Authentic 
              and engaged learning are two processes that were triggered by the 
              use of collections in which teachers/students sought to: identify 
              methods of problem solving in the use of Museum collections in project 
              development, develop interdisciplinary projects, and produce Web 
              pages that reflected curriculum. As a result, the <b>"Museum in 
              the Classroom"</b> project has not only become an integral part 
              of the Museum's learning activities, but has offered Illinois schools 
              a means to "rethink" traditional educational models.</p>

              1995 Technology Policies
            </center>
            <p>Leadership</p>
            <p>1. Technology and telecommunications are keys to improving student 
              learning in this and the next century. It is critical that equitable 
              and universal access to technology and telecommunications be available 
              to all students in the Illinois K-12 school system. The State Board 
              of Education should be providing vision, leadership, advocacy and 
              support for the technical and human resources necessary if K-12 
              schools are to improve student learning through technology and telecommunications.</p>
            <p>2. State regulations should enable and encourage school districts 
              to develop, implement and operate the technology/information plans 
              to improve student learning and increase the efficiency of education 
              systems.</p>
            <p>Affordable Access/Infrastructure</p>
            <p>3. To effectively serve K-12 students, Illinois schools must be 
              part of an electronic network that is developed, deployed, operated 
              and maintained by state agencies, local school districts, higher 
              education, community groups, business and industry.</p>
            <p>4. In order to provide equitable, ubiquitous access to electronic 
              resources for K-12 students, K-12 interests must be represented 
              in the telecommunications regulatory arena through leadership and 
              advocacy.</p>
            <p>Professional Development</p>
            <p>5. Those entering the professions of teaching and educational administration, 
              and those earning degrees/certificates in education should understand 
              and be able to use technology and telecommunications as instructional, 
              administrative and learning tools.</p>
            <p>6. Relevant, student-centered, ongoing professional development 
              is essential to successful integration of technology and telecommunications 
              in K-12 schools.</p>
            <p>Curriculum, Content and Destinations</p>
            <p>7. Students and their communities should have electronic access 
              to public information and services.</p>
            <p>8. The rethinking and redesign of teaching and learning is necessary 
              if schools are to take full advantage of the learning potential 
              inherent in technology and telecommunications.</p>

              variance is 6 years. The average number of years they used telecommunications 
              for professional activities is 2 years, and the range is 10 years. 
              The variance is 2 years.</p>
            <p><i>Student Engagement and Learning with Telecommunications</i></p>
            <p>Thirty six percent of the teachers reported that it was too late 
              in the year when they got connected to begin project related activities, 
              and would begin in the next school year.</p>
            <p>For those teachers whose students engaged in project related activities, 
              students' exposure to doing telecommunications increased dramatically. 
              Prior to the project, teachers estimated that only 7% of their students 
              could competently log on and access the Internet; and use Web browsers. 
              As a result of the projects, students participated in a range of 
              telecommunications activities. Teachers report incorporating the 
              following telecommunications activities into their classroom teaching: 
              Researching information services (52%), browsing Web sites (64%), 
              researching databases (44%), sending and retrieving e-mail (33%), 
              creating text/graphics for Web pages (53%), exchanging information 
              and data with other classrooms (20%), consulting with staff from 
              museums and other partners (36%), and having real time discussions 
              with other students or experts (16%).</p>
            <p>The vast majority of students participating were in regularly scheduled 
              mixed ability classes (45%) or inclusive classes (39%) exposing 
              students with special needs to telecommunications as well. Approximately 
              27% of teachers are using the project as a focus of an interdisciplinary 
              course for students. Another thirteen percent served honors or college 
              track students. The average number of participating students per 
              teacher was 44, with a range from 3 to 150. These teachers worked 
              with a total number 1,501 students.</p>
            <p>Students active engagement and motivation for learning increased 
              as a result of introducing telecommunications to the classroom. 
              As general measure of interest and engagement, teachers reported 
              increase in the following student behaviors: students say they want 
              more class time for this project (82%), students say they are having 
              fun learning (74%), students are interacting more with other students 
              around academic content (59%), students are taking more responsibility 
              for their own learning (59%), completing homework assignments more 
              frequently than usual (41%), and improved attendance (21%). An additional 
              44% of teachers report students expressing interest in possible 
              careers involving telecommunications and technology, and 27% state 
              that students are using their new telecommunications skills in other 
              subjects.</p>
            <p>Students are also using telecommunications to expand their learning 
              opportunities outside the classroom, and on their own time. Forty 
              two percent of teachers indicate that students ask to go on-line 
              during free periods or after school, and continue contacts with 
              adults and other students initiated in class on their own time (32%).</p>
            <p>Teachers see the most important benefit for student learning as 
              immediate access to up to date primary source data (60%), followed 
              closely by the relevancy to real issues and results (57%), and the 
              technical skills (56%) students are developing.</p>

              <b>SIUC Museum Project Evaluation Year I</b></p>
            <p><b><i>Executive Summary</i></b></p>
            <p>The University Museum at Southern Illinois University (SIUC) participated 
              in a state-wide Museum in the Classroom project referred to as the 
              Museum Explorers (ME) project. The ME project included 23 public 
              schools (elementary through high school) throughout Illinois. Applied 
              Research Consultants (ARC) was commissioned to conduct an evaluation 
              of the ME project. As part of the endeavor, ARC developed several 
              instruments to serve as both a quantitative and qualitative assessment 
              of the project's impact on participating teachers and students. 
              The primary thrust behind the evaluation was to determine students' 
              feelings, interests, and intentions regarding both their museum-related 
              topic and computers. The evaluation also assessed the teachers' 
              experiences, expectations and interests/abilities with respect to 
              both the ME project and computers.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;<b><i>Results</i></b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>At both pre- and posttest, teachers reported high expectations 
                that the ME project would increase both their students' understanding 
                of computers and the Internet.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Teachers had moderate experience with computers and some experience 
                with the Internet prior and subsequent to their participation 
                in the ME project.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Subsequent to the ME project, teachers "sometimes" used information 
                from the Internet in class while they "almost never" used this 
                type of information prior to the project.<br>
              </li>
              <li>At pre- and posttest, students generally liked to learn new 
                things and to play computer games, while they disliked English/language 
                arts and writing stories and poems.<br>
              </li>
              <li>The majority of students were looking forward to participating 
                in the ME project at pretest, and this enthusiasm did not substantially 
                wane upon completion of the project.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Generally, students reported being somewhat to very sure about 
                their abilities to use a computer and navigate the Internet both 
                prior and subsequent to the ME project.</li>

              <b>SIUC Museum Project Evaluation Year II</b></p>
            <p><b><i>Conclusions</i></b></p>
            <p>Year II of the ME project incorporated several different elements 
              than Year I. First, and foremost, schools were provided with videoconferencing 
              technology to use for connectivity to the University Museum and 
              other schools. Time had also elapsed, allowing teachers and students 
              to become more familiar with the technology present in their schools 
              and classrooms. Changes were also made to the evaluation component, 
              as the University Museum had agreed to distribute the mailings for 
              ARC in an effort to increase the response rate. The <i>Participant 
              Characteristics</i> survey was also modified to gather information 
              that was not collected during the Year I evaluation. An additional 
              measure was created to investigate teacher satisfaction with the 
              training they received up to the pretest measurement occasion. In 
              sum, these numerous changes were made to improve the evaluation 
              component of the ME project for Year II.</p>
            <p>Despite changes made in contacting participant schools and teachers, 
              the response rate for Year II showed marginal improvement. ... As 
              different schools have varied schedules, providing teachers the 
              flexibility to select when the evaluation material will be distributed 
              to the students may increase the posttest response rate. ...</p>
            <p>Although little change has occurred in participating school and 
              teacher characteristics, the additional information collected by 
              the <i>Participant Characteristics </i>survey was illustrative. 
              Approximately half of the schools select individual students to 
              participate in the ME project, while the remainder include all the 
              students in one or multiple classrooms. In may prove useful in subsequent 
              evaluations to analyze these groups separately, as important differences 
              may emerge which may have implications for how the project is administered 
              to new schools. ...</p>
