          <h2>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p> The fondness museum professionals have for standards committees 
            and for data interchange standards is well known. From the Getty thesaurus 
            to the Dublin core, on standards committees debating the 'best' graphics 
            format, the quest for the universal language which allows museum to 
            talk unto museum goes on. Apart from the common problems with standards 
            in computing: technology renders them obsolete before they are finally 
            ratified; everyone, whether through benevolence, competitive advantage 
            or the 'not invented here syndrome' introduces an extension or enhancement 
            to the standard; and too much time is spent discussing the standard 
            instead of finding something useful to do with the results, there 
            is surely an opportunity being missed as a result of the mindset which 
            urges standardisation. 
          <p> The aim of allowing a universal search of every museum database 
            is a laudable one but what does it really offer? If I search a ship 
            database for vessels between certain tonnages, are those values based 
            on gross tonnage or on displacement? If I want to look at voyages 
            to modern-day Kaliningrad in the seventeenth century do I look for 
            the modern port, or the earlier German name of K&ouml;nigsberg, or, 
            if the data refers to trading records from Scottish mercenaries in 
            Russian service, Korolovets? The way in which any historical question 
            is framed will depend to a great extent on the questioner's background 
            and intellectual baggage. <a name="backorna"></a>To make data available 
            to a wide audience either the data needs to be standardised, and user 
            thinking modified, or the users left with their modes of thought and 
            professional practices intact, and the data varied. If we can accept 
            that 'a museum can be said to offer intellectual access to its resources 
            if it enables people to think, for purposes they have defined themselves, 
            about the objects in its collection' (<a href="#orna">Orna, 1994</a>) 
            why should we try to constrain users in the potentially far more flexible 
            world of the virtual museum or archive? Data is infinitely more malleable 
            than people. 
          <p> Before we begin to think of universal access to museum data we need 
            to solve a more local problem. How can data sources within one organisation 
            meet the needs of different users within that institution and the 
            needs of visitors, physical or virtual? 
          <h2>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE COMMON DATA WELL</h2>
          <p> Every institution has multiple uses for its data. That is why many 
            museum Web sites are on-line versions of brochures or ugly extensions 
            to collections management data. Several collections management software 
            packages boast of their public-access add-ons. This, unfortunately, 
            ignores the rather obvious fact that most members of the public want 
            to ask questions quite different to curators responsible for museum 
            collections. One collections management package offering this add-on 
            feature illustrated its advertisement with a screen shot of an entry 
            for an image of a Scarlet Macaw with a button enticingly labelled 
            <i>Related</i>. What would a related entry be? Another picture of 
            a macaw, a parakeet, other animals, other preliminary oil sketches, 
            other works by the same artist, other paintings by 19th century Belgians, 
            other paintings from the same museum collection, purchased with the 
            same bequest, other paintings on paper or with similar brush strokes 
            or similar colours? We can think of limitless relations: the ones 
            we think of first reflect our own interests. Potentially, almost all 
            the relations we can conceive of are in the underlying database somewhere, 
            in that it would be possible to construct an SQL statement (assuming 
            the database supported this) to reveal them. The <i>Related</i> button 
            is, however, too coarse a tool to achieve this. 
          <p><a name="backsledge"></a> If the answers are in the data, leave the 
            data well alone, adjust the buttons instead. Develop an interface 
            appropriate to the user. Better still, if we are `enabling people 
            to think for purposes they have defined themselves', let us, where 
            possible, do away with the button altogether. Wendy Hall has written 
            about ending the 'tyranny of the button' in multimedia systems generally 
            (<a href="#hall">Hall, 1994</a>). The button in the 'standard' collections 
            management package may be the thing to make the museum professional 
            protest, 'I don't see why we should have to conform our registration 
            needs/practices to the computer's needs/limitations' (recent MCN-L 
            posting). In the public access system it takes on the role of, in 
            Peter Walsh's memorable phrase, 'the unassailable voice' (<a href="#walsh">Walsh, 
            1997</a>): this is the connection between this artefact and that which 
            will interest you, do not stray from the tightly policed corridors 
            of the virtual museum. <a name="backkydd"></a>

          <h2>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FILTERS NOT DATA STANDARDS</h2>
          <p> The authors of this paper have already described some of the mechanisms 
            in moving a database from a kiosk application to the Web (<a href="#kydd">Kydd 
            and MacKenzie, 1997</a>). The general principles learned from that 
            exercise are applicable to the porting of data between any electronic 
            delivery platforms in the museum: concentrate on the needs of the 
            users in the various environments, the data will look after itself. 
          <p> So, for example, the local newspaper, which uses the system for 
            managing its photographic archive, is interested in an image's accession 
            number because it identifies the location of the original negative 
            or print but this is irrelevant to the Web tourist. The Webmaster 
            needs a database which is fast, cheap and compatible with the server 
            software but will do little or no editing work. The curator creating 
            and maintaining the database needs tools for data entry and editing, 
            for comparing entries, for searches and for generating reports. In 
            both these instances the needs of the user are met by interface design. 
            In the first scenario, one interface simply has (at least) one more 
            field than the other. In the second, creating two interfaces to the 
            one database may not be practicable: an affordable server-ready database 
            may not have the features taken for granted in most common PC database 
            packages; the curator may not wish all entries to appear on the Web; 
            the software which needs to run with the two applications will be 
            quite different and may require different operating environments (a 
            Unix server, Windows spreadsheets and word processing facilities, 
            for example); the computing skills of the two individuals are likely 
            to be quite different and, dare I suggest, the curator is less willing 
            to change working practices to compensate for the lack of features, 
            or the difficulty of using them, in a database system with which the 
            Webmaster is comfortable. The compromises made in choosing a system 
            to satisfy both needs is likely to satisfy neither so why try? Use 
            two separate systems, two different databases. Provided one can quickly 
            transfer its data to the other it really does not matter. Transferring 
            data between modern databases is a question of knowing what the tables 
            and fields concerned are and this is essentially a header definition. 
            No matter what the subject area, one field plus this header is probably 
            sufficient to allow two systems to share data in a meaningful way. 
          <h2>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHAT IS EASY AND WHAT IS DIFFICULT</h2>
          <p> The issue of database selection for core data is essentially a non-issue. 
            Whatever the initial data source is, it is the content which is important 
            not the format. Modern databases all come with a range of import filters 
            or one can be populated from another by the construction of an SQL 
            query. Most development languages (VB, Visual C++, Smalltalk etc.) 
            can use ODBC drivers to talk to a wide range of databases. As has 
            already been argued it is making sense of the content where the challenge 
            lies. That is an interface design question not a database standardisation 
            one. 
          <p> Similarly images can easily, and automatically be converted from 
            one format to another: perhaps they exist as TIFF images for internal 
            work in a networked archive, are distributed on CD-ROM to internal 
            and external users as 24-bit JPEG images. Moving them to the Web may 
            mean there is a mixture of 8 and 24 bit GIF and JPEG images. The standard 
            is again not the issue but bandwidth is. Users on dial-up lines may 
            be less than enthusiastic waiting for images of several hundred kilobytes 
            to load yet there will be some pictures where they consider the wait 
            worthwhile. To give them the choice the obvious solution is thumbnails. 
            There are certainly automatic thumbnail generation packages but what 
            happens, if we decide that all the thumbnails are to be the same size 
            to fit in a pre-defined search results matrix, with images in a wide 
            range of shapes and sizes, what about large images where shrinking 
            the whole image produces a thumbnail where identification of the key 
            features is no longer possible? Manually creating thumbnails is not 
            an option for something like the TAMH project where around 4000 images 
            are involved. Creating a toolkit of small applications to ease tasks 
            like this is an ongoing process and a route worth following for anyone 
            trying to get more value from their data. 
          <p><a name="backmac"></a> The really difficult thing, as in any computer 
            application, is giving the users what they want (or need, the two 
            are not usually the same) complicated here by the fact that multiple 
            use of data implies multiple audiences for that data with very different 
            interests, backgrounds and working practices as described above. This 
            has basic technical implications. The kiosk-based TAMH implementation 
            concentrated on letting users, ranging from young schoolchildren to 
            post-doctoral researchers, ask the questions they wanted to ask in 
            they way they wanted to ask them and so avoided fixed hypertext links 
            as much as possible (<a href="#mackenzie95">MacKenzie, 1995, 1996</a>). 
            Current Web technology prevents a straight emulation of this there 
            and the whole Web is, after all, built on such links. An earlier paper 
            (<a href="#kydd">Kydd and MacKenzie, 1997</a>) described some of the 
            strategies we employed to implement this design philosophy on the 
            Web in an <i>ad hoc</i> way. Work since then has concentrated on developing 
            tools to allow the migration of data between print, collections management, 
            kiosk and Web applications to follow a more generic model. We would 
            not try to argue that the tools we have developed are the only mechanism 
            by which such a task can be carried out but we would argue that the 
            general approach is the only valid one, that it is not about standardisation 
            of data but rather about developing interface tools and filters which 
            present that data in ways appropriate to the different user groups. 
            <a name="backlight"></a> 
          <h2>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EARLY EXAMPLES</h2>
          <p> We came to the multiple use of data on an ad hoc basis. Doing some 
            work on archiving material on Joseph Beuys in Scotland, we had word 
            processed catalogue entries on the <i>Strategy: Get Arts</i> exhibition 
            of 1970. However, in addition to printing these, we required a formatted 
            view of the pages in a touch-screen kiosk application. It would have 
            been possible to have prepared SGML versions of the files, as several 
            museums do with their catalogues (<a href="#light">Light, 1995</a>), 
            which would produce both on-screen and printed output. However, time 
            was short, the person responsible for the files was not skilled in 
            SGML so we produced a very simple in-house formatting tool, called 
            BLURB, to serve the same function. It proved adequate for its intended 
            task and also allowed the catalogue entries to be included in a CD-ROM 
            on Joseph Beuys. Because it is simple to use, fully integrated with 
            in-house word-processing and has little adverse effect on the typing 
            speeds of secretarial staff, it also became the method used for formatting 
            newspaper articles in the TAMH project. BLURB will never go before 
            a standards committee, is quite limited in what it can do, but was 
            selected for its ease-of-use rather than any standardisation considerations. 
            The relatively simple syntax means that it is simple to run it through 
            a filter to produce, for example, Web pages of the newspaper articles 
            in TAMH (<a href="../http://www.dmcsoft.com/tamh/"  target="_blank">www.dmcsoft.com/tamh/</a>). 
          <p> Similarly our Antique Golf site (<a href="../http://www.dmcsoft.com/antiquegolf/"

  target="_blank">www.dmcsoft.com/antiquegolf/</a>) is simply a Web-based extension 
            of an existing database. The clubs are listed in an Access database 
            for off-line searching and for inventory purposes. Access was chosen 
            because the person responsible for maintaining the inventory was familiar 
            with the package and, again, moving this database to the MySQL database 
            version which drives the website is simple, just running an SQL query. 
            Similarly DDE/OLE allows it to be the engine for a print-based catalogue. 
          <p> The point in choosing these tools is not that the data is standardised 
            but that it is adaptable and portable. The Access golf club database 
            meets the needs of the person maintaining the inventory and who is 
            sitting with the real clubs; the Web-based version meets the needs 
            of the browser who wants to see what the clubs look like. 
          <h2>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MUSDEV: A GENERIC APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM</h2>
          <p> The early version of the TAMH data entry module was really just 
            the display version of the software with the database write enabled. 
            As the entries grew it became apparent that this was not adequate 
            for cross-referencing articles or checking what was already there 
            or for maintaining the fields which were not seen by most users, accession 
            numbers, the relationship between main table entries and tables of 
            short biographical entries, visit sites, keywords, thesaurus entries 
            and the like. We also suffered from good ideas: new fields and tables 
            to add, and these meant individual changes to the database query and 
            write parts of the code on a woefully uncontrolled basis. Another 
            realisation was that our first thought, to drive the system from a 
            database was the right one, but whereas we initially held around eighty-five 
            per cent of the data in databases we should have, and ultimately did, 
            move everything to one database. This meant moving map data, graphing 
            and icon-display functions into the database and this forced the decision 
            to go for a more generic solution to the problem. 
          <p> The result is what we call MusDev, an interface to a database which 
            defines the relationship between the data elements but does not attempt 
            to define what happens with that relationship. Nor does it care what 
            the database is or what it contains. Our TAMH data source was an Access 
            database, so we stuck with that, but it would work equally well with 
            any other database, local or remote, for which ODBC drivers exist. 
          <p> <b>Figure 1</b> below shows a Main Table (in effect, a short article) 
            entry on Admiral Greig. The buttons along the bottom of the screen 
            indicate the other tables in the MusDev source for this project. If 
            the images button is pressed, the images currently associated with 
            this entry are shown (<b>Figure 2</b>). If I wish to associate new 
            images or longer articles with this short entry, going to the <b>Add 
            Links</b> screen (<b>Figure 3</b>) offers the facility of browsing 
            and selecting other table entries and dragging and dropping them onto 
            the link diagram. The entry can be completed on <b>Figure 1</b> by 
            adding descriptive abstracts and assigning it to time periods, sources 
            and subject area categories according to those already in the database 
            or, added interactively, from this screen. Keywords are used as descriptors, 
            those appearing in lowercase are ones generated automatically by the 
            system based on its thesaurus which may also be edited on-screen. 
            In this example the alternative spelling <b>Cronstadt</b> and the 
            city to which it is the port, <b>St Petersburg</b>, is generated for 
            <b>Kronstadt</b>.

          <p> This has defined the entry and it relationship to other types of 
            entry (images, articles, places to visit, artefacts etc) and gathered 
            some clues as to search terms which are relevant but it makes no reference 
            to how a user of the kiosk- based system will see the relationship 
            between the entry and, say, the image. This is essential if we are 
            to leave the option of multiple use of the data open. 
          <p> 
          <h3>MusDev as Toolkit</h3>
          MusDev is also an ever expanding toolkit for the administrative tasks 
          identified in Section 4 above. The tools we have incorporated in it 
          so far include the following. 
          <h4>Automating thumbnail generation</h4>
          <p> The Thumbnail Generator is illustrated in <b>Figure 9</b>. Although 
            it can with <b>Autocapture</b> generate thumbnails for whole sets 
            of images, where an awkward shape or content presents, as in the portrait 
            of the lady in Figure 9 where the important detail is the fact that 
            she has a characteristic head-dress and is reading a bible, a draggable 
            box can specify the area to be thumbnailed. 
          <p> <a  target="_blank" href="figure9.gif"><img src="fig9s.gif" width=200 height=150 border=1 alt="Figure 9"></a> 
            <a  target="_blank" href="figure10.gif"><img src="fig10s.gif" width=200 height=150 border=1 alt="Figure 10"></a> 
            <br>
            <b>Figures 9 and 10</b>: Thumbnail generator and image search matrix 
          <p><a name="backholt"></a> The advantage of generating meaningful thumbnails 
            is apparent from <b>Figure 10</b> which shows one of the image search 
            matrices. Like many other developers we have struggled with using 
            keywords to describe images and their inherent limitations (<a href="#mackenzie95">MacKenzie, 
            1995</a>) and followed similarity algorithms such as QBIC (<a href="#holt">Holt, 
            Hartwick and Vetter, 1995</a>) and ARTISAN (<a href="#eakins">Eakins, 
            Shields and Boardman, 1996</a>) with interest and reached the conclusion 
            that, for now, the most efficient way of allowing people to find images 
            of interest to them is just to let them look. Even with very fast 
            flicking through pages such as the one illustrated here, users can 
            pick out the images they want. This is the justification for "content-rich" 
            thumbnails. <a name="backkauf"></a> 
          <h4>The Keyword Hierarchy Tool</h4>
          <p> The problems of using keyword or even free-text searching to identify 
            topics of interest are well documented. Michelle Kaufmann (<a href="#kaufman">Kaufmann, 
            1996</a>) gives examples of searching for <i>Passover</i> and it resulting 
            in matches on items about dietary restrictions, identity or even just 
            as a reference to a point in time. Similarly the search would miss 
            references to <i>Passover</i> in the Hebrew form, <i>Pesach</i>. Examples 
            in this paper have already referred to the changing port names in 
            the TAMH project where the form used will often depend on either the 
            nationality of the searcher or the period of history in which he or 
            she is interested. 
          <p> <a  target="_blank" href="figure11.gif"><img src="fig11s.gif" width=250 height=247 border=1 alt="Figure 11"></a> 
            <br>
            <b>Figure 11</b>: Keyword hierarchy 
          <p> We decided on a very simple approach, a screen which allows entry 
            of one keyword followed by a list of acceptable synonyms (<b>Figure 
            11</b>). The type of item for which we needed to specify synonyms 
            was so wide: from geographical names: Kurzeme for Courland; different 
            English idioms, railroad for railway; different terminology in cargoes, 
            flax, hemp and codilla used interchangeably; or abbreviations RNLI 
            for Royal National Lifeboat Institution that a simple approach seemed 
            to be the best and no catch-all thesaurus would serve our purpose. 
          <p> The point is, however, that using this tool in a different subject 
            area where it was appropriate we could import any commonly used thesaurus 
            or controlled vocabulary such as the one Michelle Kaufman describes 
            at the Shoah Foundation. Again this is an example of concentrating 
            on the interface not the standard. Any controlled vocabulary can ultimately 
            be decomposed to a one to many relationship. Different projects will 
            call for different thesauri so rather than deliberate as to which 
            is generally the best one, allow the possibility of using any. If 
            we can agree a simple way of relating one controlled vocabulary to 
            another where there is some degree of overlap, so much the better. 
          <h2>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPONENT APPROACH</h2>
          <p> The kiosk-based version of TAMH uses the database created by MusDev 
            with no changes whatsoever. It merely adds the interface layers and 
            search tools. <b>Figure 4</b> shows the actt of searching for <b>St 
            Petersburg</b> (one of the system- generated keywords) and how the 
            entry appears to the kiosk user (<b>Figure 5</b>). <b>Figure 6</b> 
            shows what the user sees by touching the small image, a larger view 
            with magnification and other options. Returning to the main entry 
            display and touching (or dragging the mouse) over <b>Battle of Hogland</b> 
            brings up a <b>Link</b> button (<b>Figure 7</b>) to start searching 
            for all references to that phrase. Any word, or series of words can 
            be selected in this way, everything is 'linkable' not just the terms 
            the system authors specify. 
          <p> <a  target="_blank" href="figure4.gif"><img src="fig4s.gif" width=140 height=160 border=1 alt="Figure 4"></a> 
            <a  target="_blank" href="figure5.gif"><img src="fig5s.gif" width=140 height=105 border=1 alt="Figure 5"></a> 
            <a  target="_blank" href="figure6.gif"><img src="fig6s.gif" width=140 height=105 border=1 alt="Figure 6"></a> 
            <br>
            <b>Figures 4, 5 and 6</b>: Search results, entry record, and image 
            viewer 
          <p> All of these display, link and search options are separate components 
            which use the database content as their input. New components can 
            be added, and existing ones modified, without a requirement to change 
            the underlying database. Components themselves may be edited (or modified 
            from an administrator screen <b>Figure 8</b>) so that not all displayable 
            fields from a particular component are on-screen, simplifying the 
            mariner database search and display for a school audience, for example. 
            MusDev is, in effect, our collections management package: the kiosk-based 
            version of TAMH is another department which seeks to use some of the 
            core data for completely different purposes and, therefore, wishes 
            to have something other than the collections management view of the 
            data. 
          <p> <a  target="_blank" href="figure7.gif"><img src="fig7s.gif" width=200 height=239 border=1 alt="Figure 7"></a> 
            <a  target="_blank" href="figure8.gif"><img src="fig8s.gif" width=200 height=152 border=1 alt="Figure 8"></a> 
            <br>
            <b>Figures 7 and 8</b>: Text link and administrator screen 
          <p> The component-based approach extends the life of the data enormously. 
            We can add new components to reflect changes in technology, a user 
            has a machine fast enough to display the archived TIFF images rather 
            than the usual JPEG representations, or changes in emphasis, (exhibits 
            associated with Admiral Duncan, last year being the bicentenary of 
            his most famous victory at Camperdown) or changes in use, a school 
            asks for a facility for students to cut and paste images, multimedia 
            elements and text into multimedia essays. What we really wanted, though, 
            was a button marked <b>Web</b> which would take the database and publish 
            it to the Web not exactly the way it appears in the kiosk but in a 
            way which takes account of Web browsers' needs and the technology 
            limitations and strengths of that particular environment. To say we 
            are not quite there yet is something of an understatement but the 
            component-based approach has certainly been a step in the right direction. 
          <h2>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPONENTS AND THE WEB</h2>
          <p> Many current website production and management tools allow site 
            designers to produce component-based sites. DMC uses its own tool, 
            WebDev (<a href="../http://www.dmcsoft.com/webdev/"  target="_blank">www.dmcsoft.com/webdev/</a>) 
            to achieve this, allowing the integration of dynamic content from 
            databases into web pages. WebDev uses a component-based architecture 
            for sites, allowing the separation of content-producing components 
            from interface appearance components such as headers, footers, menus 
            and graphics. This approach works well with the MusDev component model, 
            allowing site templates for the overall look and feel of the website 
            to be distinguished from the components which MusDev has to generate. 
          <p> Websites and their constituent web pages can be broken down into 
            a series of components. A web page which displayed an article record 
            from the TAMH database might consist of standard header and footer 
            components for the page, and a database query component which ran 
            a database search for the record and formatted the data for output. 
            The header and footer components would be reusable on other pages 
            in the website, removing the need to change all the pages on the site 
            when these standard elements had to be altered. An image collection 
            component might point to the location of an image archive on the web 
            server, and could use an extra parameter to refer to an individual 
            image within that collection for display on a web page. If the image 
            collection were moved to a different location, the only reference 
            which would need to be changed would be that in the image collection 
            component itself. Other components could encapsulate web page elements 
            such as search input forms and website menus. Breaking the web page, 
            and consequently the website down into a series of such components, 
            makes it more manageable. 
          <p> The examples given in the previous section have web equivalents. 
            The keyword search form in <b>Figure 4</b> would translate into an 
            HTML form. Clicking on the button would link to a page with the keyword 
            query component, producing a record display equivalent to <b>Figure 
            5</b>, with the image being an inline image thumbnail from an image 
            collection component. This image would be linked to a full size image, 
            so that the user could inspect it as in <b>Figure 6</b>. Because of 
            the limitations of HTML, the equivalent of the text selection and 
            link searching in <b>Figure 7</b> would simply be a form with text 
            input box for searching on a user-specified term. 
          <h2>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEBSITE PUBLISHING</h2>
          <p> WebDev allows a website to be structured so that components which 
            produce content (from image archives or database queries) can be separated 
            from other components which control site structure or page layout. 
            A site structure and layout components for page style could be used 
            in conjunction with templates of content production components to 
            build a generic website where all that was missing to complete the 
            system was the equivalent of the kiosk system's display, link and 
            search components. 
          <p> Publishing to the web involves taking the interface layers and search 
            tools developed for the standalone kiosk system and creating web-based 
            versions of them. MusDev has provided a number of tools for managing 
            both database and image information, and separating this data from 
            the actual interface used in a user-based kiosk system or an administration-oriented 
            collections management system. The next stage in this evolution is 
            to take the user system and map this onto a web-based user interface. 
          <p> MusDev makes the transfer of the underlying data into a straightforward 
            task. The database can be migrated from the standalone system to a 
            web-accessible database server using a combination of MusDev tools 
            and standard software such as Microsoft Access. For the TAMH project, 
            DMC currently uses a simple set of Access queries and an ODBC link 
            to update the server database from the standalone version, although 
            this task may eventually be integrated into the MusDev toolset. The 
            image archive can be copied to a webserver, or shared between standalone 
            and web versions in a networked environment, and necessary conversions 
            of image formats to web-friendly versions can be achieved. Image references 
            in the database can be converted to point to the new locations on 
            the server as part of the database import routine. Thumbnail generation 
            can produce images which allow web users to preview images before 
            selecting those of interest to them to download at a better resolution 
            and quality, but without wasting download times on images they have 
            no interest in. 
          <p> As mentioned previously, the kiosk-based version of TAMH uses display, 
            link and search components to build its interface. The aim is to have 
            MusDev map these components onto web-based equivalents. Display components 
            can be treated as generic HTML formatting of database records and 
            images, link components implement searches on the database from user-selected 
            input criteria, and search components have HTML input forms and SQL 
            queries to search the database. Using this component-based approach, 
            website templates equivalent to the kiosk system components can be 
            constructed and output by MusDev. Parameters for the components in 
            MusDev are combined with the templates to output the website equivalents 
            of the kiosk system. 
          <p> It should be noted that because of some of the limitations in current 
            web-based interfaces, these components are described as equivalent, 
            rather than the same. For instance, the example in the previous section 
            of selecting text in a record and having it automatically appear as 
            search text is not possible in standard HTML text, so the equivalent 
            web component allows manual entry of the selected phrase into a text 
            box in an HTML form. Similar compromises can be made with other types 
            of components. The advantage of the component architecture is that 
            if a new solution is produced for a particular component, then the 
            application can have its display templates for that component type 
            changed to produce the new model for all such components. 
          <p> Websites in general differ from kiosk systems in that they need 
            to provide the user with more context information: a user at a kiosk 
            system usually knows where they are (i.e. they have walked into the 
            museum and have a physical reference for their location). Users on 
            the Internet do not have the same frame of reference, as they may 
            have linked from anywhere on the web to reach the website location. 
            Therefore they need information to identify what the site is they 
            are viewing, and to help them navigate within that site. A site designer 
            could choose or produce templates for the overall look of the website, 
            provide the extra context information that the website needs (information 
            about the website, news and external links sections, etc) and generate 
            the content- specific components based on the kiosk system design 
            in MusDev. 
          <p> The eventual goal is to have a straightforward route to publishing 
            the same data and similar interface and search tools on both the kiosk 
            and web systems. MusDev currently produces the component-based interface 
            for the kiosk system. WebDev currently provides website design and 
            management functionality. Up until now the move from kiosk to web 
            has involved a manual process of mapping one set of components onto 
            the other. The task now is to produce a flexible template-based system 
            to allow MusDev to export its components to a WebDev project. 
          <h2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h2>
          <p> The intention of MusDev is to produce a generic set of tools for 
            integrating museum data with a number of administration- and user-centred 
            systems. Currently it has been used with our own TAMH project, and 
            we are actively looking for partners within the museum community to 
            test the portability of the system to other subject areas. One of 
            the ways in which MusDev will be enhanced in its web integration capabilities 
            is by building a library of museum-like components for users to choose 
            from, so that we get ever closer to the "Press button for Web version" 
            situation. 
          <p> MusDev is a set of tools which allow a single set of data sources 
            to be used for multiple purposes within an organisation. The emphasis 
            on the portability of the data and the independence of data from the 
            interfaces and search mechanisms which use it means that it can be 
            used with one interface for data management and another interface 
            for a kiosk system. The final step of integrating an interface to 
            the web into the system is well under way.
