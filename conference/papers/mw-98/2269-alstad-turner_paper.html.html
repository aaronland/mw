            <table>
              <td> Web technology has made it possible for artists to control 
                the means of distribution of their work and access audiences outside 
                the mainstream gallery system. Year Zero One grew out of a desire 
                to connect with other artists and to showcase and encourage the 
                new genre of web specific artworks. In this presentation, we will 
                explore the developing language and aesthetics of the web and 
                how artists around the world are creating works using this dynamic, 
                participatory new medium. 
                <p> Science and art are derived from the Greek word techne. These 
                  two disciplines were interconnected and provided a wholistic 
                  world view leading to the blooming of arts, literature and science 
                  during the Renaissance. The age of "enlightenment" ended this 
                  age of wonder and mystery and encouraged the growth of rationalism 
                  that created a rift between artists and scientists. Each discipline 
                  went their separate way, trying to explain the world. 
                <p> During the information age, the web developed becoming a tool 
                  for global knowledge sharing between people of different walks 
                  of life, cultures and geographical locations. Information is 
                  converging to form new disciplines such as artificial life, 
                  nanotechnology and fuzzy logic. There was also a resurgence 
                  of old disciplines such as geomancy, astrology and alchemy. 
                  Science is merging once again with art, philosophy and psychology. 
                  Never before have so many people had so much access to so much 
                  information. A wholistic view of the world is re-emerging and 
                  scientists are uncovering "new" theorems such as, the holographic 
                  universe paradigm, confirming what the sages of old knew all 
                  along, that we are all of the same fabric and together we are 
                  greater than the sum of the parts. 
                <p> The alchemical process is a good metaphor for describing the 
                  potential of the web not only as a tool for artmaking but as 
                  a new medium. On the web, artists are able to connect with each 
                  other to create spaces that are provocative, interactive and 
                  empowering. Alchemy is an ancient discipline associated with 
                  the transmutation of base metals into gold or transforming something 
                  ordinary into something special. Artists now have: accessible 
                  technological tools, the ability to engage and directly interact 
                  with participants, a growing pool of knowledge and the potential 
                  to communicate to huge audiences. 
                <p> This paper shows a cross section of the web at this moment 
                  in time highlighting events such as: a visit via digital microscope 
                  to a tiny installation where the mystery of human life itself 
                  is occurring, an art collective who was contacted via their 
                  web site by an artist doing work thousands of miles away, a 
                  mysterious shadowbox where participants manipulate lights and 
                  take pictures, a site where one can parent a creature, watch 
                  it evolve, rejoice when it gives birth and grieve when it dies. 
                  This is the ultimate age of alchemy. Let the transmutations 
                  begin! 
                <p> First stop, a site aptly named, <a href="../http://128.95.41.62/Alchymeia3.html" target="_top">"Alchymeia"</a>. 
                  The work was on view via web cam as part of the 1998 Nagano 
                  Winter Olympics Ice Art Festival. Shawn Brinkley, its creator, 
                  is interested in the emerging interface between art, science 
                  and technology. Alchymeia was created by introducing the naturally 
                  occurring steroids found in the urine of two Olympic athletes 
                  into "ultra-pure/ultra-cold" water. The water on its own, because 
                  it has all its impurities removed, cannot form crystals because 
                  there is no material from which to create. The presence of the 
                  highly ordered human genetic material forms a pattern which 
                  becomes the mould the ice crystals faithfully grow into. 
                <p> <cite>"The crystals in this exhibition act as amplified recordings 
                  of one's physical presence expressed at a level of telematic 
                  so removed from operational awareness, it becomes a virtual 
                  space."<a name="1foot" href="#1">1</a></cite> 
                <p> This site is unique in its approach to art making on the web. 
                  The art creates itself. Shawn has set up a situation where we 
                  become the observers of a minute world where the miracle of 
                  transmutation is occurring in real time via digital video microscopy. 
                  We watch what is essentially human presence being manifested 
                  and amplified through the use of the tools of web technology. 
                <p> Because of the transitory nature of the piece, and indeed 
                  the web itself, the artwork is no longer accessible in real 
                  time. <a href="../http://www.washington.edu/cartah/smart/brixey/SBproj.html" target="_top">Shawn's 
                  personal site</a> now documents the experience, crystallizing 
                  it as it were. 
                <p> <a href="../http://www.year01.com/year01/gallery.htm" target="_top">Random 
                  Excess Memory</a> is the title of the current group show of 
                  three international web specific art projects at Year Zero One. 
                  One of the sites <a href="../http://www.jodi.org/" target="_top">jodi,</a> 
                  is a kafkaesque maze of buttons, programming language, links, 
                  icons and collaged 'digital debris' where the visitor will go 
                  on an endless search finding nothing but more links to the virtual 
                  void. Along this claustrophobic and crazy journey an occasional 
                  'bomb' or 'virus' icon appears playing with our collective anxiety 
                  and fear of the ultimate computer crash. Jodi makes us realise 
                  we are never content with being stationary on the web...we will 
                  always be clicking away looking for what's beyond...searching 
                  for the absolute. 
                <p> <em>"Evolution is a creative process, which acting independently, 
                  has produced living forms of great beauty and complexity. Today, 
                  artists and engineers are beginning to work together with evolution. 
                  In the future, it may be possible for artists to work in collaboration 
                  with evolution to produce works of art whose beauty and complexity 
                  approach that of organic life."</em><a name="2foot" href="#2">2</a>
                <p> Artificial Life is the use of genetic algorithms to create 
                  silicon based life forms. In an episode of X-files written by 
                  William Gibson, an artificial life form which was created to 
                  exist on the internet, lashed out into the "real world" and 
                  took the lives of its creators. Via a posthumous message on 
                  the net from one of its designers, the viewer is left with the 
                  feeling that life has gone on and perhaps they are now enjoying 
                  direct communion with their creature creation in another dimension. 
                  Communities are being developed around "A-life" where participants 
                  are becoming emotionally invested in their life forms. 
                <p> <a href="../http://alifegarden.com/" target="_top">A-Life Garden,</a> 
                  hosted in Japan, is a world with a maximum of 500 lifeforms 
                  where humans can look through the "Picto Book" and "buy" cute 
                  little globular creatures. No cash changes hands but there is 
                  a point system. New members start out with enough points to 
                  "purchase" ten creatures and when offspring result, accumulate 
                  more points. Each a-lifeform comes endowed with 50 kb of DNA 
                  data. Statistics are compiled and available via the picto book 
                  which lists ratings for vitality, size, preference for and adaptability 
                  to various substances. Every hour there is a detailed text based 
                  report of the goings on of the Garden where one can monitor 
                  all the creatures within the ecosystem. 
                <p> One of the most colourful forms of life here, is the human 
                  component. Tesh Nakamura is the keeper of the grounds and originator 
                  of the garden. He wrote the program as a concrete application 
                  of his PhD studies in self evolving designs and neural networks. 
                  Since then, it has become home to members from all over Europe, 
                  North America and Japan. There is a sense of community and impassioned 
                  discussions occur around issues that affect the ecosystem. Several 
                  members expressed outrage at the idea of introducing "artificial" 
                  ways of controlling the environment. 
                <p> A site which exemplifies the convergence of scientific and 
                  artistic principles as well as embodying the concept 'interactive 
                  art form' is called <a href="../http://taylor.ieor.berkeley.edu/shadowserver/index.html" target="_top"> 
                  Shadow Server</a>. A professor of engineering at The University 
                  of California Ken Goldberg, who holds a degree in robotics, 
                  built a box containing five halogen bulbs and various objects. 
                  When the lights inside the box are illuminated the 'mystery 
                  objects' cast a shadow onto a scrim. A camera records the black 
                  and white image and transmits it back to the viewer across the 
                  Internet. On the web site interface there are five buttons where 
                  the viewer can control the lighting within the box. There are 
                  32 possible shadow combinations. 
                <p> Goldgerg's work is concerned with how viewers perceive electronically 
                  mediated images over distances - questioning both the new technologies 
                  and that which they are seeing. The objects inside the Shadow 
                  Server are never seen directly, only as muted silhouettes cast 
                  upon a sheet. Goldberg was inspired by Marcel Duchamp's <em>Ball 
                  of Twine (With Hidden Noise)</em>, an artwork made in 1916 where 
                  he requested a patron to hide an unidentified object within 
                  a ball of string, which was then secured with screws between 
                  two steel plates and sealed in shellac. Duchamp never knew what 
                  was inside and since both he and the patron are dead, nor will 
                  anyone else. We can draw a parallel between this idea and the 
                  experience of visual perception on the web. What is beneath 
                  the ephemeral images?... something intangible and outside the 
                  realm of objective experience. 
                <p> The web not only has provided artists with a new medium it 
                  has also led to an entire arts related resource network where 
                  artists can connect and collaborate with other artists. The 
                  Toronto based artist collective <a href="../http://www.interlog.com/~alstad/symbiosis/" target="_top">Symbiosis 
                  </a> recently hosted a site specific exhibition in a vacant 
                  Royal Bank of Canada. The collective invited several guests 
                  artists whose work previously explored issues around money, 
                  banking and systems of exchange. Jerelyn Hanrahans <a href="../http://artnetweb.com/gesture.html" target="_top"> 
                  Gesture as Value</a> was 'found' on the web and the collective 
                  requested her to bring her project from Bern, Switzerland to 
                  <a href="../http://www.interlog.com/~alstad/symbiosis/projects.html" target="_top">The 
                  Bank of Symbiosis</a> in Toronto. The Gesture as Value project 
                  uses an ATM Bank Machine which dispenses bill sized 'artworks' 
                  after the individual inserts their bank card and deposits their 
                  own 'gesture'. Jerelyn collected the gestures from diverse sources 
                  such as schools, old age homes, and psychiatric wards with the 
                  intention of using the bills as a type of <cite>"exchange as 
                  social value minimising national borders and offering individuals, 
                  using the machine, a broad perspective on other realities."

                <p> Shortly after the launch of their web site, Symbiosis received 
                  a request from an artist, Rene Rusjan to participate in the 
                  Triennale of Art in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Via the web, the artist 
                  requested Symbiosis members to answer several specific questions 
                  she proposed - either through text, images, video and/or audio 
                  - for inclusion in a physical installation in three parts: the 
                  Room with a View; the Room with Memory and the Room With an 
                  Ear. The visitors to the gallery were given the opportunity 
                  to interact with the various 'answers' collected from artists 
                  around the world! 
                <p> Categorizing the new genre of "web specific" art is like trying 
                  to hit a moving target. The landscape changes at an alarming 
                  rate with the proliferation of new art sites that challenge 
                  the boundaries of art. Scientists are becoming artists and artists 
                  are becoming scientists. New tools and techniques develop as 
                  the new work demands. The common denominator is that the web 
                  is integral to the work. As a gallery that exists solely on 
                  the web, Year Zero One has become a witness and a catalyst for 
                  the alchemical acts that are occurring. <br>
