              The advent of the World Wide Web has introduced a new communication 
              channel, through which people can easily access museum content, 
              events, activities, and schedules. Since the use of museum web sites 
              is spreading all over the world, and these sites are attracting 
              an increasing number of "virtual" visitors, it has become crucial 
              to improve their <i>usability</i>, i.e. the visitor's ability to 
              use these sites and to access their content in the most effective 
              way. As a consequence, it has become compelling to provide both 
              quality criteria that WWW sites must satisfy in order to be usable, 
              and systematic methods for evaluating such criteria.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This paper describes a technique for evaluating the usability of 
              hypermedia applications, either off-line (i.e., multimedia CD-ROMs 
              or Information Points) and on-line (i.e., Web sites). The approach 
              presented here is based upon a general methodology named SUE - <u>S</u>ystematic 
              <u>U</u>sability <u>E</u>valuation. Four attributes can be used 
              to characterize SUE: <i>heuristic</i>, <i>empirical</i>,<i> systematic</i>, 
              and <i>model-based</i>. It is <i>heuristic</i> according to the 
              definition proposed by Nielsen [<a href="#Nie93" name="Nie93back">Nie93</a>], 
              in that it identifies a set of usability principles, or heuristics, 
              that evaluation experts must check when the application is inspected 
              for usability. Heuristic evaluation falls into the broader range 
              of usability engineering methods called "inspection", which do not 
              involve end users, but only "expert" evaluators.&nbsp;SUE is also 
              <i>empirical</i>, in the sense that user testing is used to validate 
              and refine the result of the inspection. The combination of inspection 
              and empirical testing ensures the most accurate evaluation results, 
              coupled with cost-effectiveness.&nbsp;SUE is <i>systematic </i>in 
              the way usability inspection and empirical testing are performed. 
              The inspection is carried on by executing a set of predefined <i>evaluation 
              activities</i>, called <i>abstract tasks</i>. The use of abstract 
              tasks makes the heuristic evaluation better organized and more effective, 
              and also encourages standardization across different evaluators 
              and evaluation processes. The empirical testing is carried on by 
              requiring some end-users to perform <i>concrete tasks</i>, i.e. 
              specific activities, based upon the result of inspection. The use 
              of concrete tasks makes the empirical testing more organized and 
              cost-effective.&nbsp;SUE, finally, is <i>model-based</i> since models 
              are used to precisely shape the evaluation activities. In this paper, 
              as we are examining hypermedia, we have used HDM (Hypermedia Design 
              Model), developed at Politecnico di Milano.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly 
              presents the overall approach of the SUE methodology. In section 
              3, SUE is specialized for hypermedia and we will discuss the model, 
              the usability criteria, and (a sample of) the abstract tasks, that 
              represent the cornerstones of our method. Section 4 illustrates 
              our approach by presenting some (fragments of) evaluations of museums 
              sites. Section 5 draws some conclusions.&nbsp;</p>

         name="What is SUE?">2.1 What is SUE?</a></b>&nbsp;<br>
              SUE is a general methodology for usability evaluation of interactive 
              systems, developed at Politecnico di Milano, in co-operation with 
              the industrial partner CORINTO (<u>CO</u>nsorzio <u>RI</u>cerca 
              <u>N</u>azionale <u>T</u>ecnologia ad <u>O</u>ggetti - an Italian 
              consortium involving IBM-SEMEA, APPLE-Italy, and SELFIN), and the 
              Universities of Lecce and Bari.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The aim of SUE is twofold:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to support a broad, multi-dimension analysis of usability, and 
              <li>to make usability evaluation systematic and cost effective. 
            </ul>
            <p>Most existing approaches to usability evaluation address only general 
              interface issues, e.g. the lay-out design, the choice of icons and 
              fonts, the interaction style, etc.. The main assumption of SUE is 
              that usability analysis, instead, should consider the specific nature 
              of the application to be evaluated.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>SUE suggests analyzing a system from different perspectives:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li><i>general perspective</i>, where the features common to all 
                interactive applications are considered; 
              <li><i>application-category</i> perspective<i>, </i>that considers 
                only the peculiar features of a specific functional class of applications 
                (e.g., "hypermedia", "word-processor", "transaction processing 
                system"); 
              <li><i>application-destination</i> perspective, that focuses on 
                the specific domain of an application within a given category 
                (e.g., "tourism" hypermedia, or "education" hypermedia). 
            </ul>
            <p>For each different perspective considered during the evaluation, 
              SUE requires two operational phases of evaluation: i.e. the <i>preparatory 
              phase,</i> and the <i>execution phase, </i>briefly described in 
              the rest of this section.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><a name="2.2"></a><b><a href="#Paper Outline"

         name="2.2 The SUE Preparatory Phase">2.2 The SUE Preparatory Phase</a></b>&nbsp;<br>
              The purpose of the preparatory phase is to create the conceptual 
              framework that allows the evaluation to be carried on in a systematic 
              and effective way. The preparatory phase (for each perspective) 
              consists of three different activities:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the choice of a <i>model</i>; 
              <li>the definition of a <i>set of usability attributes</i>; and 
              <li>the specification of a set of <i>abstract tasks</i>. 
            </ul>
            <p>The model identifies unambiguously the constituents of an interactive 
              system that are the "entities of interest" [<a href="#Fen91" name="Fen91back">Fen91</a>] 
              for evaluation. The term "model" is used here in a very broad and 
              loose sense, intending a set of primitives capable of describing 
              an application. SUE does not prescribe which model should be used; 
              the only requirement is that a model is used, and that the chosen 
              model is sufficiently expressive to describe, in a non-ambiguous 
              way, all the "entities of interest".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The usability attributes are quality factors (closely related to 
              the specific evaluation perspective being considered), under which 
              usability is decomposed, in order to be more specifically analyzed 
              and measured.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Abstract tasks are "generic" operational activities that evaluators 
              must perform during inspection. We call them "abstract" since they 
              are formulated independently from a specific application, and they 
              do not refer to the specific objects and functionality of a specific 
              system, but, rather, to classes of objects and functionality that 
              are relevant for the chosen perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b><a href="#Paper Outline" name="2.3">2.3 The SUE Execution Phase: 
              Inspection and User Testing</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              The execution phase occurs each time a specific product is evaluated, 
              and systematically combines <i>inspection </i>and<i> empirical testing.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Inspection is a generic term for a range of usability engineering 
              methods that have seen an increasing widespread use. As we mentioned 
              in the introduction, inspection methods do not involve end users, 
              but "expert" evaluators only; since they "save users" [<a href="#Nie94"

         name="Nie94back">Nie94</a>], and require neither special equipment, nor 
              lab facilities, they are cheaper than other evaluation techniques. 
              Another defining characteristic of inspection methods is that they 
              are more informal than other techniques, since evaluation is "based 
              on the considered judgment of the inspectors" [<a href="#Nie94"

         name="Nie94back">Nie94</a>]. If compared with other inspection methods, 
              the novelty of SUE-based inspection is that evaluators systematically 
              exploit the results of the preparatory phase, in order to be more 
              organized, standardized and cost-effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Inspection is carried out first, and detects a preliminary set 
              of potential usability problems. It is then followed by empirical 
              testing, which consists of selecting a sample from the real user 
              community, assigning them a set of tasks to be performed by using 
              the application, and recording their actions. The novelty of SUE 
              is that empirical testing is precisely driven by the output of inspection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              Since the focus of this paper is not SUE, in general, but its application 
              to hypermedia, this section presents the conceptual framework tailored 
              for hypermedia: the chosen model, HDM, the set of usability attributes, 
              and a sample set of abstract tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

         name="3.1 The HDM Model">3.1 The HDM Model</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              HDM defines a number of <i>dimensions</i> along which a hypermedia 
              application can be modeled: <i>structure</i>, <i>navigation</i>, 
              <i>behavior</i>, <i>user control</i>, and <i>presentation</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><i>Structure </i>describes how the application content is organized.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Navigation 
              </i>concerns the definition of the browsing paradigms, i.e., the 
              actual links available to the user for exploring the application 
              structures.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><i>Behavior </i>concerns two aspects:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the dynamics of time-based media such as video, sound, animation, 
                i.e., how their state evolves with time, by effect of user interaction 
                or in dependency of the state of other media; 
              <li>the dynamics of links, i.e., the effects of link traversing 
                on the state of time-based media in the source and destination 
                nodes. 
            </ul>
            <p><i>User control</i> concerns the operations available to the user 
              to interact with the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Presentation </i>concerns 
              how all the previous features are "shown" to readers, and is related 
              to the lay-out of objects (anchors, buttons, windows, menus, etc.), 
              and their visual properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In its current version, HDM focuses mainly on structure, navigation, 
              behavior, and user control. In this section we introduce a very 
              short synthesis of the model, mainly addressing structural and navigational 
              primitives, which are the most relevant for modeling WWW hypermedia. 
              The reader is referred to [<a href="#Gar93"

         name="Gar95back">Gar95</a>,&nbsp;<a href="#Gar98a"

         name="Gar98aback">Gar98a</a>] for a complete description of the HDM model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>HDM distinguishes between <i>hyperbase</i> structures, which constitute 
              the so called <i>hyperbase layer (hyperbase </i>for short) of the 
              application, and <i>access </i>structures, which constitute the 
              so called <i>access layer.</i> Hyperbase structures are used to 
              represent domain information, while access structures provide entry 
              points to the hyperbase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The hyperbase consists of <i>typed</i> <i>entities</i> and <i>typed 
              semantic connections</i>. Semantic connections represent domain-dependent 
              relationships among (parts of) entities. Entities denote conceptual 
              or physical objects of the application domain and are composite 
              representation structures; their logical constituents are called 
              <i>components</i>, and are organized according to some topological 
              patterns (e.g., sequences, trees, lattices). Components in turn 
              are made of a set of <i>typed</i> <i>nodes</i>. Different nodes 
              within a component describe different "perspectives" along which 
              the component subject can be represented. Nodes are the containers 
              of content; they correspond to "pages" (or, sometimes, page sections), 
              and aggregate a number of content elements called <i>slots. </i>A 
              slot can be complex, i.e., it may include a number of different 
              media, but it is always an atomic unit from the user interaction 
              point of view.<i> </i>A slot can be <i>static </i>or <i>dynamic,</i> 
              depending whether it stores time-independent media (such as formatted 
              data, text strings, images and graphics) or time-based media (as 
              video, sound, or animation). The type of a slot is defined by the 
              conceptual and physical nature of its media.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The access layer consists of <i>collections</i>. A collection groups 
              a number of "members", in order to make them accessible. Members 
              of a collection are hyperbase elements (entities, components, or 
              nodes) or other collections. Collections including other collections 
              among their members are called <i>nested</i>. A collection may have 
              a <i>center</i> node, (although it is not mandatory) which is the 
              starting point of the navigation within the collection and usually 
              contains some information about the collection itself. Members of 
              collections are collected according to some semantic criteria (e.g., 
              in a museum application, "all paintings of a specific painting School"), 
              or according to an expected user's goal (e.g., "the top ten paintings" 
              for a quick visit of the museum pieces). Guided tours [<a href="#Tri88" name="Tri88back">Tri88</a>] 
              or tables of contents, commonly found in hypermedia applications, 
              are modeled by collections in HDM.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Navigation defines how to explore entities and collections. It 
              is specified by means of <i>navigational links </i>(links for short) 
              that connect nodes within the various structures. Navigational links 
              are classified as structural, applicative, or collection links. 
              <i>Structural links </i>connect nodes within an entity according 
              to its topology; <i>applicative links </i>connect nodes of different 
              entities related by some semantic connections; <i>collection links 
              </i>connect the constituents of a collection. Links in the various 
              categories are typed. A collection is called <i>guided tour</i> 
              if it has only links connecting the center to the first member, 
              and the each member to another. A collection is called <i>index</i> 
              if it has only links connecting the center to each member, and vice 
              versa. A <i>guided tour index</i> is a collection which includes 
              both sets of links.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

         name="3.2 Usability Attributes">3.2 Usability Attributes</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              Usability attributes are empirical qualities that we expect from 
              a well designed and a well implemented application. To define our 
              usability attributes, we have first considered two <i>general </i>and 
              universally acknowledged<i> </i>principles - <i>learnability </i>and 
              <i>efficiency</i>, and have decomposed them into a number of hypermedia 
              specific sub-principles that represent our usability attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Learnability concerns the features of an interactive system that 
              allow novice users to use it initially, and then to attain a maximum 
              level of performance [<a href="#Dix93"

         name="Dix93back">Dix93</a>], and is decomposed into two attributes - 
              <i>consistency </i>and <i>predictability. </i>Efficiency concerns 
              the features that support the successful achievement of the user's 
              goals, with a high level of productivity, and can be described in 
              terms of <i>accessibility </i>and <i>orientation.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>The HDM model helps focus our analysis of general usability principles, 
              to identify the various classes of features which should be considered 
              for usability, and to organize our attributes. Since HDM does not 
              support presentation modeling, our approach does not consider presentation 
              features. However, with the relevant exception of anchors, most 
              presentation features of a hypermedia are largely independent of 
              the specific nature of this class of systems, and concern evaluation 
              from the general perspective. Furthermore, we will not consider 
              in this paper usability features related to the dynamics of a hypermedia 
              application, i.e., behavior of (and user control of) links and active 
              media. For example, we will not discuss the usability of mechanisms 
              that allow users to manipulate the state of video, sound, animation, 
              etc. (by means of commands, such as "start", "stop", "pause", "restart", 
              "forward", "backward" etc.), or the effects of link traversing. 
              These features are relevant for hypermedia which include a significant 
              amount of active media, which is not the case of most WWW applications.

         name="Gar98cback">Gar98c</a>] for a discussion of all these aspects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b><i>Consistency</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              Consistency means that conceptually similar elements are treated 
              in a similar fashion, while conceptually different elements are 
              treated differently. From a structural perspective, consistency 
              prescribes that entities representing domain objects of the same 
              class aggregate components of similar types, and with a similar 
              topology, components of the same type aggregate nodes of the same 
              type. Nodes representing similar components, or similar perspectives 
              of a component, contain similar sets of slots. Analogous considerations 
              can be made for the access layer. From a navigational perspective, 
              consistency prescribes similar navigation patterns (i.e., similar 
              sets of navigation links) within entities of the same type, within 
              similar collections, and across entities related by semantic connections 
              of the same nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b><i>Predictability</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              Predictability focuses on the user's ability to identify the meaning 
              of a structure or foresee the results of an interaction, having 
              seen a similar structure or operation in analogous situations. Predictability 
              measures the user's ability to form a predictive model of how the 
              content is organized and how the system behaves, and also to "learn" 
              complex situations after a significant amount of time spent with 
              the system. The main factors that contribute to predictability are 
              <i>regularity</i>, <i>collection ordering coherency</i>, and <i>user's 
              knowledge conformance.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Regularity governs the degree of similarity in structures (and 
              behaviors and user control, not discussed here), not only in similar 
              situations as it is prescribed for consistency, but also across 
              the overall application. It can be measured in terms of use of recurrent 
              topological and navigational patterns, both for entities and collections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><i>Collection Ordering Coherency</i> requires that the navigation 
              order among the members of a collection corresponds to the order 
              in which such members are described in the collection center (e.g., 
              by means of a list of descriptors such as titles, icons, miniaturized 
              pictures, or similar). If the center shows the descriptors of two 
              members, say X and Y, one after the other, according to some visual 
              order, navigating forward from X the user expects to find Y, and 
              not something else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><i>User's Knowledge Conformance</i> measures how well the elements 
              available in the application match the mental model of the intended 
              users, i.e., their set of assumptions, information, or preconceptions 
              about the application domain, about hypermedia in general, and about 
              the actual system. Clearly, different users have different mental 
              models, and measuring user's knowledge conformance of a system is 
              a very subjective process. The evaluator should verify if structures, 
              navigation, behavior and interaction metaphors available in the 
              application are appropriate for representing domain concepts, semantic 
              relationships, styles of use that can be considered somehow standard, 
              or at least intuitive, in a given cultural context and for the intended 
              class of users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b><i>Accessibility</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              Accessibility<i> </i>measures how easy is for the users to locate 
              the piece(s) of information they are looking for. It promotes usability 
              particularly for users who have a specific information goal or must 
              perform a specific task. Accessibility means that, from a given 
              starting point, users can quickly locate the items that are needed 
              for their task, without navigating through non-relevant material; 
              or, alternatively, they can quickly discover that those items are 
              not in the application. A number of factors contribute to accessibility. 
              Some of them concern the completeness and efficacy of access structures. 
              Completeness refers to how the organization of access structures 
              and the content of their centers can be mapped to the set of hyperbase 
              entity types and to their instances. When users enter a WWW site, 
              for example, the home page, i.e., the center of the top level index 
              of the application, should immediately give a global sense of the 
              application content, and the perception of the hyperbase entity 
              types. If an entity type or its instances are not mentioned by any 
              collections, neither at the top level, nor at some level of nesting, 
              users might not discover them, unless they traverse some applicative 
              link (if any) in the hyperbase. The efficacy of access structure 
              organization is mainly related to the trade-off "breadth versus 
              depth" in nested collections (i.e., the number of collection members, 
              at a given level, versus the number of levels of sub-nesting). For 
              efficiency, it is often more appropriate to minimize the levels 
              of nesting. Another important factor for efficiency is the <i>navigational 
              richness,</i> i.e., the abundance of links connecting the various 
              information elements. Which links are more appropriate in which 
              situation is largely dependent on the nature and complexity of content. 
              In a short and simple-content guided tour, for example, the link 
              "next" - from a member to the following one, and its inverse ("previous"), 
              might be enough. Still, in a complex guided tour, made of several 
              steps and storing complex content, users may also need to jump to 
              the end or to the beginning of the tour, or to rapidly jump to any 
              member starting from the current one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b><i>Orientation</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              Orientation is related to the "getting lost in the hyperspace" problem, 
              a common usability issue for large hypermedia. Orientation measures 
              the users' ability to understand their current location and their 
              own movements, to grasp their current navigation context, and to 
              return to previously visited items. A number of aspects can be considered 
              to support orientation, such as <i>backtracking soundness, context 
              observability, </i>and <i>reuse soundness</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><i>Backtracking</i> is the mechanisms by which the user can return 
              back to previously visited nodes, and is one of the most common 
              orientation facilities in hypermedia, especially on the WWW (where 
              it is provided directly from the browser). Unfortunately, applications 
              very often provide the backtracking function in place of explicit 
              navigation links (e.g., as a surrogate for inverse links), thus 
              overburdening backtracking commands with a number of meanings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><i>Context Observability</i> concerns the possibility for users 
              to evaluate the actual status of their navigation session, and to 
              understand the positioning of the current node within larger structures 
              or within the entire application. Many applications use active maps 
              and overview diagrams, with indications of the user's current location 
              (and of previous steps), both to summarize the application content 
              and to support orientation. Observability can also be supported 
              by means of some perceivable visual cues on the nodes. For example, 
              the relative position in a guided tour, or in a linear sequence 
              of nodes, can be presented by a descriptor, such as "3<sup>rd</sup> 
              of 10" (which also helps users to perceive how long is the way to 
              the last element).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><i>Reuse Soundness </i>analyses if reuse is well designed. Reuse 
              means that structures, links, and operations, already used somewhere, 
              are used again in a different context and for different purposes. 
              Reuse has a number of advantages but it may also have some critical 
              drawbacks. To avoid the increase of cognitive complexity and disorientation, 
              reused elements must not include any context-dependent feature, 
              or they must be adapted to the new context [<a href="#Gar96" name="Gar96back">Gar96</a>]. 
              For example, if a piece of content in a node depends on a given 
              context, it should be removed when reusing the node in another context 
              (and may be replaced with information needed by the new situation). 
              Alternatively, if there is important information that is left implicit 
              in a node and can be induced from a given context, it should be 
              made explicit when the node is reused in a new context.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

         name="3.3 Abstract Tasks">3.3 Abstract Tasks</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              Abstract tasks describe the activities that, during the inspection, 
              the evaluators must perform in order to detect potential usability 
              problems. We use the term "abstract", since they are formulated 
              independently from a particular application, and they refer to categories 
              of application constituents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>An abstract task is described by five elements: the identification 
              <i>code</i>; the <i>title</i>; the <i>focus of action</i>, i.e., 
              the constituents which are the focus of the activity; the <i>activity 
              description</i>, which describes what evaluators have to do, the 
              <i>intent</i>, i.e., a short statement explaining what is the rationale 
              of the abstract task. Optionally a <i>comment</i>, clarifying some

              on the HDM model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The reader is deferred to [<a href="#Gar98a"

         name="Gar98aback">Gar98a</a>] for a complete list of thirty abstract 
              tasks, which cover the complete set of features of an hypermedia 
              application. In the rest of this section we shortly introduce a 
              few examples, just to provide the reader with the "flavor" of what 
              abstract tasks are. The abstract tasks described here are mainly 
              concern with the primitives that in HDM are called <i>access structures</i>, 
              i.e., the collection of objects upon which indexes and guided tours 
              are built, that are commonly used in almost every WWW application. 
              In particular the first three abstract tasks (from AS-O1 to AS-O3) 
              refer to the <i>organization</i> of the access structures, while 
              the last four (from AS-N1 to AS-N2) refer to the <i>navigation</i> 
              within the access structures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>AS-O1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Title:</i></b> "Extent of access structures"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Focus of Action:</i></b> an entity type, and the set of collections.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Activity Description: </i></b>consider an entity type (e.g. 
              "painting"):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              1. verify if there are collections (indexes or guided tours) which 
              allow the direct access to its instances;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              2. verify if there is at least a collection which allows the access 
              to <i>all </i>its instances.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Intent: </i></b>to check if access methods efficiently support 
              access to the hyperbase entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Comment:</i></b> a typical usability problem occurs when some 
              entity types, i.e., classes of application objects, are not directly 
              accessible by any collection (index or guided tour), and the only 
              way to access them is through links from other entities. Another 
              type of problem arises when the collections do not cover the complete 
              extension of the entity type, in the sense that some of the instances 
              are left out. Both types of problems are, surprisingly, quite common.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>AS-O2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Title: </i></b>"Information quality in collection centers"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Focus of Action:</i></b> a collection center (i.e., the front 
              page of an index or a guided tour).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Activity Description:</i></b> verify if the information content 
              in the collection center accurately describes the content of the 
              collection itself. For example, verify:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              1. the <i>completeness</i>, i.e., if all the members of the collection 
              are clearly identifiable;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              2. the <i>correctness</i>, i.e., if the description of each member 
              precisely describes the member itself;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              3. the <i>ordering</i>, i.e., if the order in which members are 
              listed precisely corresponds to the navigation order in which members 
              are traversed in the collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Intent:</i></b> to verify how well the center of a collection 
              supports user's understanding of what is and what is not in the 
              collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Comment:</i></b> centers of collections, i.e. the page through 
              which indexes or guided tours are presented, are crucial for the 
              effective usability of application. Imprecise, incomplete, or low 
              quality information in a center, incurs fruitless user navigation 
              (in the sense that they access items not really relevant to them) 
              or can result in potentially interesting pieces of information being 
              overlooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <b><i>Title:</i></b> "Nesting levels of access structures"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Focus of Action:</i></b> the set of collections (i.e. indexes 
              and guided tours).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Activity Description:</i></b> starting from the home page, 
              reach the hyperbase objects (entities), following different paths 
              across indexes and guided tours.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Intent:</i></b> to identify the access structure depth, and 
              verify if there are hierarchies of collections with a high degree 
              of nesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Comment:</i></b> it is always a difficult trade-off to structure 
              a large application in the sense of "breadth" or "depth". Sometimes 
              nesting is a necessity, but it should be kept in mind that an high 
              level of nesting almost inevitably creates usability problems (in 
              the sense that the reader may never reach the bottom of the nesting, 
              or find his/her way up from the bottom).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <b><i>Title: </i></b>"Complexity of collection navigation patterns"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Focus of Action:</i></b> a collection, and the set of collection 
              links.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Activity Description:</i></b> in a collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              1. verify the complexity of the collection navigation pattern. For 
              example:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>from the collection center, access a generic collection member; 
              <li>from a generic member of the collection, access: 
                <ol>
                  <li type="i">the previous and the next member in the collection 
                    order; 
                  <li>the first collection member and the last one; 
                  <li>another arbitrary member; 
                  <li>the collection center (if any); 
                </ol>
              <li>from the first (respectively, the last) member, try to go "previous" 
                (respectively "next"); 
            </ul>
            <p>2. verify the appropriateness of such a pattern, in accordance 
              with the collection content and structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Intent: </i></b>to verify if the navigation pattern of a collection 
              is adequate for the content and the purpose of the collection itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Comment:</i></b> again it is a difficult trade-off between 
              rich, complex navigation patterns, which can be difficult to handle, 
              and simplified, easily understandable navigation patterns, that 
              may lack the necessary power. This is an area where, despite the 
              difficulty of finding a proper design choice, technical mistakes 
              are easily found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>AS-N2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Title:</i></b> "Up-navigation in nested collections"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Focus of Action:</i> </b>nested collections (indexes and/or 
              guided tours).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Activity Description:</i></b> verify the existence and the 
              appropriateness of mechanisms for navigating "upwards" within nested 
              collections. For example, starting from the home, go down in the 
              hierarchy of collections, and then:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              1. go up through the same indexes;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              2. go up through different indexes (if any);&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              3. traverse applicative or structural links, then try to go up to 
              the higher level indexes, up to the home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Intent:</i></b> to assess if adequate navigation patterns 
              are provided for nested collections. The relevance of this task 
              clearly depends on the use (or abuse) of the nesting within the 
              application.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Comment: </i></b>a typical problem that generally arises is 
              that poor mechanisms are provided for navigating upwards through 
              nested collections. Therefore, once users go down through the collection 
              hierarchy, they do not have any way to go up to the centers of higher 
              level indexes, and in particular to the home page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <b><i>Title:</i></b> "Visibility of navigation status in collection 
              navigation"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Focus of Action:</i></b> a collection (index or guided tour).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Activity Description:</i></b> in a collection, access an arbitrary 
              member, and identify its position in the collection structure, uniquely 
              from what you see (forgetting the path that has been followed).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Intent:</i></b> to verify if members are provided with clear 
              indications about their location in the collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Comment:</i></b> identifying the position of a member within 
              a collection is a crucial aspect of user orientation. It becomes 
              even more important (and technically more difficult) if the same 
              member belongs to different collections or appears in different 
              positions within the same collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <b><i>Title:</i> "</b>Backtracking versus collection navigation"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Focus of Action</i>:</b> a collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Activity Description</i>:</b> in a collection, verify if and 
              how backtracking is used within collection navigation. For example:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              1. go to a generic intermediate member, without passing through 
              the previous members in the collection order; then access the previous 
              member;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              2. go to a generic member, without passing through the collection 
              center; then go up to the center.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Intent: </i></b>to assess the effect of using backtracking 
              commands as a surrogate for navigation commands.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <b><i>Comment</i></b>: backtracking, which returns the users back 
              to the previously visited node, is one of the most important and 
              common navigation facilities. As discussed by Nielsen [<a href="#Nie95" name="Nie95back">Nie95</a>], 
              "almost all hypertext systems provide some form of backtracking, 
              but not always very consistent". Many hypermedia (especially on 
              the Web!) make an intense use of the backtracking function (oftentimes 
              called "back" or, ambiguously, "previous") to overcome the lack 
              of explicit navigation links. Although in some cases it may work, 
              in most cases it does not, and it can result in user disorientation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

              In this paper we only limit ourselves to the inspection activity. 
              We have inspected a number of museum web sites, using our abstract 
              tasks for hypermedia, a sample of which has been described in the 
              previous section. The overall structure of the sites is quite simple 
              (in the worst cases, just a tree structure), in comparison, for 
              example, to structures that could be found in multimedia CD-ROM. 
              Simple structure can be easy to manage, but ineffective, from a 
              usability point of view. When more articulated and organized structures 
              are attempted, some usability problems seem to arise.&nbsp;

              in the meantime. Inspections, of course, have used the full range 
              of abstract tasks, and not just the few sample described in the

              Hosted within the "Christus Rex and Redemptor Mundi" site, the on-line 
              guide to the Vatican Museum allows access to images of the works 
              exhibited in the numerous museum galleries, from the Gallery of 
              Tapestries to the Gallery of Paintings.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A "work" (an entity-type, in the HDM terminology) is only described 
              by a set of pictures (in most cases, just one). The access structure 
              is organized in several collections, corresponding to the museum 
              galleries. Each collection has a center, consisting of a scrollable 
              list (sometime <i>very long</i>) of thumbnails, through which nice 
              pictures of the art works can be found.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This site is a good example of very simple structure, easy to grasp, 
              with (relatively minor) usability problems:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the lack of collection navigation across members ("works") requires 
                a continuous navigation from the list of works (collection center), 
                to a work, then back to the list to choose the next member, etc.. 
                Some further mechanisms for navigating across members would significantly 
                improve the usability of the site. 
              <li>the positioning of a "work" in the context of a collection is, 
                in general, unclear: there is no explicit indication of the collection 
                the work belongs to, nor of its current position in the set of 
                collection members. 
              <li>at the bottom of each list of works (collection center), a navigation 
                bar provides commands for going up to the overview of available 
                collections, and for navigating to the center of the previous 
                and next collections. This is a nice feature, but its positioning 
                (at the end of long lists) is unfortunate: it is likely that many 
                readers will miss it. Also for those who know that the navigation 
                bar is there, it is annoying to have to scroll a long list to 
                reach it.

              In our opinion, this is one of the best organized and most enjoyable 
              museum sites; it really offers a nice and usable preview of what 
              is available (permanently or temporarily) at the National Gallery 
              in Washington, a wonderful museum on its own.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Also in this case the most important entity type is "work", describing 
              a piece of the museum collection or exhibitions. The access layer 
              includes a number of nested collections (indexes and guided tours), 
              which allow access to the museum works according to different criteria 
              (e.g., by work nature, by subject, by artist, by country, by historical 
              period). A powerful search tool ("Search the Collection") provides 
              an efficient access mechanism to the same contents.</p>
            <p>A few results, from the inspections, are now described. Let us 
              assume that the search facility is used in order to get information 
              about the Italian Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli. After reaching 
              Botticelli's page (containing a short biographical note, and the 
              list of the artist's works exhibited at the museum), we select one 
              of the Botticelli's paintings, for example "The Adoration of the 
              Magi". The corresponding page (shown in <a href="nga1.htm"

         target="_blank">fig. NGA-1</a>) includes a small picture of the painting, 
              a caption, and an interesting text describing the work. Below the 
              text, a set of anchors named "full screen image"<font size="-2">, 
              </font>"bibliography", "detail images", "location", "narratives"<font size="-2">, 
              </font>"provenance", "tour", "purchase reproduction"<i>, </i>provide 
              links to different pages related to this painting. The name Botticelli, 
              on the side of the painting picture, is a link to the artist page.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The page shown in fig. NGA-1, and the pages accessed by means of 
              links "full screen image",<font size="-2"> </font>"bibliography", 
              "detail images", "narratives"<font

         size="-2">, "</font>provenance", "purchase reproduction", store information 
              which are <i>intrinsically </i>"part of" the current painting (and 
              of no other paintings); these pages can therefore be regarded as 
              <i>components</i> of the entity (of type work) "The Adoration of 
              the Magi", and links to them are examples of <i>structural</i> links 
              in HDM. Links named "location" and " tour", instead, can be used 
              to access pages storing information which are not exclusive of "The 
              Adoration of the Magi", being related <i>also</i> to other paintings. 
              "Location", in fact, is an <i>applicative</i> link (in HDM terminology), 
              which takes to the room where the painting is located, together 
              with several works by various artists. "Tour" is a collection link 
              . The first observation is that structural links are visually intermixed 
              with links of different nature, i.e., with the applicative links 
              and the collection links. This visualization may disorient the reader, 
              since "location" and "tour" will lead him/her to a different object, 
              with respect to the one currently active, i.e., "The Adoration of 
              the Magi". Selecting the link "full screen image", the page shown 
              in <a href="nga2.htm" target="_blank">fig. NGA-2</a> is activated. 
              From NGA-2 the link "information" leads to NGA-1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If from NGA-1 the link "bibliography" is selected, page <a href="nga3.htm" target="_blank">NGA-3</a> 
              is activated, with the usual set of links, but "bibliography" itself. 
              From NGA-1, the link "detail images" leads to the page reported 
              in <a href="nga4.htm" target="_blank">fig. NGA-4</a>, that is also 
              accessible from page NGA-2; from page NGA-4, page NGA-2 is reachable, 
              and vice versa. From NGA-1, the link "location" leads to the page 
              reported in <a href="nga5.htm"

         target="_blank">fig. NGA-5</a>, which describes a room, and is completely 
              outside the description of the painting. From&nbsp; NGA-1, the link 
              "narratives" leads to a page shown in <a href="nga6.htm" target="_blank">fig. 
              NGA-6</a>. The page looks exactly as NGA-1, with the exception of 
              the text: the first part of it is the same as that of NGA-1; the 
              second part is new. First of all, the user may get confused by the 
              fact that the text is initially the same: until the text is scrolled, 
              the page looks exactly the same as NGA-1. This "self-reference" 
              effect is increased by the fact that the set of links is the same; 
              more surprising, selecting the link "narratives" from NGA-6, NGA-1 
              is the destination!&nbsp;<br>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, since in page NGA-2 the link leading to NGA-1 is called 
              "information", we think that the interplay between the link "narratives" 
              and "information" is overall quite confusing. From NGA-1, "provenance" 
              leads to page shown in <a href="nga7.htm" target="_blank">fig. NGA-7</a>, 
              where the link "provenance" itself is missing. Let us now activate, 
              again from NGA-1, "tour", which takes to the page shown in <a href="nga8.htm" target="_blank">fig. 
              NGA-8</a>. This is the center of a collection (in the HDM terminology) 
              that provides a guided tour of a few paintings. First of all, let 
              us repeat that moving from a painting to a complete different context 
              (a guided tour) should have been treated differently from the other 
              (structural) links. Secondly, the anchor "back to 15th<sup> </sup>century 
              Italian paintings" looks quite odd: the sense of "back" is unclear, 
              since we have never been there so far. The explanation is simple: 
              the navigation could have started by selecting "Collections" from 
              the home page; from there, "Italian 15th Century" could have been 
              selected, and then "Patrons and Artists in Late 15th Century in 
              Florence", leading to NGA-8. Following this path, the label "back 
              to 15th-century Italian paintings" makes sense, of course. </p>
            <p>Whatever the path followed to reach the page of figure NGA-8, let 
              us select the second painting: reaching the page shown in <a href="nga9.htm" target="_blank">fig. 
              NGA-9</a>. If we compare figures NGA-1 and NGA-9, the small picture 
              and its caption are the same. The text is different: in NGA-1 it 
              is a general description of the painting, and in NGA-8 it focuses 
              on the aspects of the painting that are relevant for the guided 
              tour theme. More precisely, in NGA-9 it is exactly the second part 
              of the text that we found in the component "narratives", shown in 
              NGA-6. If the reader feels that the situation is a little confusing, 
              we agree.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The set of links from NGA-9 is slightly different, from those of 
              NGA-1: "narratives", "detail images", and "tour" are omitted, and 
              we wonder why. At the bottom of the page there are two new links: 
              one allows the reader to proceed to the next step of the tour ("continue 
              tour")<i>, </i>and the other ("back to gallery") enables the access 
              to the tour center (and has therefore the same effect as the link 
              "tour" in figure NGA-1). In this case too, if the reader feels that 
              the situation is a little confusing, we agree.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Navigating within the guided tour, the behavior is slightly different 
              from that seen before: from the painting page, from the bibliography 
              page and from the provenance page the tour can be continued (in 
              the sense of moving to the next painting from figure NGA-8). From 
              "full screen image" and "location", instead, the tour can not be 
              continued (although the context is correctly retained).&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Our overall comment is that minor problems arise within the context 
              of the painting and the context of the guided tour; major problems 
              arise from the interplay between the two contexts. These are typical 
              problems induced by the conceptual complexity and by the need to 
              reuse the same material in different contexts.&nbsp;</p>

              <b>Virtual Uffizi </b>(<i><a href="../http://www.arca.net/uffizi"

         target="_top">http://www.arca.net/uffizi</a></i>)<i> </i>is a private 
              site about the "Galleria degli Uffizi" in Florence. We tried to 
              retrieve information available about Sandro Botticelli (the same 
              painter as the "The Adoration of the Magi"). This artist has many 
              paintings at the "real" Uffizi Museum, and we expected him to be 
              largely represented in the Virtual Uffizi too. We started our navigation 
              choosing the "Artists Index", where artists are listed in alphabetical 
              order. We could not find any entry for Botticelli under letter B! 
              We tried with "Filipepi" (Sandro Filipepi is the real name of the 
              painter), with no success. Finally, we discover that the alphabetical 
              order is by first name and not by surname, and we finally discovered 
              the way to access Botticelli under the letter S (<u>S</u>andro, 
              Filipepi called Botticelli!). The observation that this solution 
              may disorient most readers seems quite obvious.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the very nice site of the <b>Kimbell Museum in Forth Worth</b> 
              - Texas (<i><a href="../http://www.kimbellart.org/"

         target="_top">http://www.kimbellart.org</a></i>) the first sentence in 
              the home page, reported in&nbsp; <a href="KI-1.htm" target="_blank">fig. 
              K-1</a>, encourages the reader to start the visit from the most 
              famous exhibits, including the famous "top painters". Each artist's 
              name corresponds to a link to the artist's page. It is a bit tricky 
              to discover how to access an artist not mentioned in the first sentence 
              of the home page: although the access layer of this site also includes 
              an Index of Artists, which intends to collects <i>all</i> artists 
              in the Kimbell Museum, this index is not directly accessible from 
              the home page, and it is not easy to realize how to find it. If 
              we try to select "Gallery"<i> </i>from the home page, we get to 
              a page with no information, but a link "Continue to Gallery Entrance"<i>, 
              </i>which finally leads to page where the link to the Index of Artists 
              is available. If we go to the page of one of the top artists, we 
              discover a link to the index there. If for example readers start 
              by selecting one of the artists mentioned in the home page - e.g., 
              <i>Caravaggio, </i>they access a long scrollable page describing 
              this painter (<a href="KI-2a.htm" target="_blank">fig. K-2a</a> 
              and <a href="KI-2b.htm" target="_blank">K-2b</a>). At the bottom 
              of this page (fig. K-2b) the reader is encouraged to "Return to 
              Artists Index" (the use of the term "return" is a bit disturbing, 
              since the user might never have been there so far). If this link 
              is activated, the reader reaches the center of the Index, i.e., 
              the page partially shown in <a href="KI-3a.htm" target="_blank">fig. 
              K-3</a>. Unfortunately, in the list of artists <i>there is no entry 
              </i>named<i> Caravaggio, </i>nor <i>Merisi Michelangelo</i>, the 
              real name of the painter. The Reader's surprise can be safely assumed.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b><font size="+1"><a href="#Paper Outline" name="5">5. Conclusions</a></font></b>&nbsp;<br>
              Usability is important for museum web sites, as well as for all 
              the other sites. A usable site allows the user to easily exploit 
              the content of the site itself; a lack of usability, instead, may 
              lead to user disorientation or, in the worst case, to deep frustration 
              due to the inability to proceed in the exploration.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Usability problems, in most cases, arise from an inconsistent design 
              or errors in implementation. Even if design and implementation are 
              well organized, (minor) usability problem may arise for a number 
              of different reasons. Since it is impossible to make sure, in advance, 
              that no problems exists, it is wise to plan, in any case, a careful 
              evaluation.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In this paper we have proposed a systematic and model-driven approach 
              to the evaluation of usability. Our plan is to conduct now a set 
              of experiments, where the findings of the inspection evaluation 
              (done by experts) can be compared with the results of empirical 
              testing done with samples of end-users.&nbsp;</p>
