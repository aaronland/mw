              <b><a href="#toc" name="intro">1. INTRODUCTION</a></b></p>
            <p>This is a paper about the interplay of web technology with discipline-specific 
              content. On the one hand, this paper explores how the Internet may 
              further the purposes of one field of internet activity. On the other 
              hand, the paper examines how the discipline-specific needs of a 
              single field may stimulate internet development and perhaps even 
              influence its direction.</p>
            <p>This will happen only if there is more day-by-day interplay between 
              specialists in technology and content creators. My participation 
              in this conference and its predecessor last year spring from the 
              conviction that more subject matter specialists who are also reasonably 
              conversant with computer technology need to participate in the conscious 
              development of the Internet; whether their fields be biology, economics, 
              or, in the case of this paper, the field of art conservation and 
              historic preservation. As with papers I have published on digital 
              images&nbsp;<a name="[1]"></a><a href="#(1)">&#91;1&#93;</a>, this 
              paper is intentionally written from the user's point of view.</p>
            <p>The museum world is so vast and so diverse that every major discipline 
              has a significant place. Employed in full-time curatorial and scientific 
              laboratory positions in museums around the world are specialists 
              in Asian population growth, Dutch windmills, infra-red reflectography, 
              and most other specialties we could name. Yet, judging by the participants 
              in last year's Museums and the Web conference, few of these content 
              creators are sent by their institutions to conferences focusing 
              on the Internet. I met lots of new computer specialists at last 
              year's conference and look forward to renewing these friendships, 
              but, I confess, I saw only two professional colleagues. When I work 
              in museums, the people with whom I normally talk and sometimes collaborate 
              are curators and conservators. I realize, in writing this paper, 
              that I shall have to seek publication in one of the conservation 
              or world heritage journals if I am to reach them with the proposals 
              in this paper. Certainly no one group alone is responsible for this 
              situation, but this does not alleviate the seriousness of such a 
              divorce of technology and information specialists from the content 
              creators.</p>

            <p>I am convinced that the Internet offers immense potential, in many 
              ways, for the preservation of our cultural heritage. A few museums 
              and university departments (often connected), the major conservation 
              institutes, and several international organizations are already 
              making significant use of the Internet for conservation and preservation 
              (sorry, but one has to use both words to cover the field), with 
              a remarkable increase in the amount of information readily available 
              and in the speed with which questions and answers can be shared 
              internationally. In this paper, I wish to call attention to the 
              nature of these already impressive current uses; to examine a few 
              of the new types of internet use that have recently been implemented, 
              and especially to project types of uses not yet available, which 
              could be of immense value in preserving the art, architecture, and 
              other material culture of the world.</p>
            <p>As far as I have been able to discover, nothing has been published 
              that is at all comprehensive in examining internet uses in this 
              field, and I am under no illusion that this paper can be more than 
              an initial sketch. Therefore, I think of this as a work in progress 
              which I intend to submit to my colleagues in all areas of conservation 
              and preservation, for their corrections, new information, and especially 
              for new ideas, for types of internet uses which they would find 
              of special value, even if these now seem remote, even unattainable.</p>
            <p>Let us be clear about our subject, the Internet. In order to focus 
              on this subject, we must recognize that the many important uses 
              of computers in conservation laboratories, on university servers, 
              and museum kiosks, are relevant here only if they are available 
              on the Internet. Most of the advanced uses of technology in this 
              field are not. That, I am convinced, will change. In fact, it is 
              the existence of the Internet that justifies many of the innovations 
              that are now taking place.</p>
            <p>But the Internet itself has a rather single and easily described 
              function. It makes possible the conveyance of information. It is 
              a network along which any kind of digitized information can flow. 
              To emphasize that it is simply a tube through which information 
              may flow, Jack Kessler, one of my most valued informants, would 
              say, "it is a pipe, just a pipe." This network of pipes, or tubes, 
              has certain well-known characteristics, which thus do not need to 
              detain us here: it reaches directly vast numbers of people around 
              the world, and it allows whatever information is transmitted to 
              go at lightning speed.</p>
            <p>What does concern us here is the uses that these characteristics 
              facilitate in any specific field of human activity, especially any 
              highly desirable uses that they might facilitate, but at present 
              do not. To explore these in at least a semi-systematic fashion, 
              let us consider first the types of information it is desirable to 
              convey, second their degrees of permanence, and third the means 
              by which this information is exchanged.</p>
            <p>The exemplary sites mentioned in this paper do not constitute a 
              review of internet sites in conservation and historic preservation. 
              There are other equally deserving sites not mentioned, and even 
              where a site is discussed to exemplify one type or another of internet 
              use, other features of the site go unmentioned. The aim of this 
              paper is to describe the various types of internet uses that exist 
              and should exist in the field, illustrated with a few examples.<br>
            </p>
            <p><b><a href="#toc" name="types">2. TYPES OF INFORMATION</a></b></p>
            <p>Because the Internet is itself content neutral, it might be thought 
              that the type of information conveyed on the Internet is irrelevant 
              to this paper, but internet technology and internet content are 
              interdependent. To make what I hope is an obvious point, much of 
              the important content already available on the Internet would not 
              even have been created had there been no opportunity for making 
              it available on the Internet. It would have been too expensive to 
              publish in print form, and the needs of the local community alone 
              would not have justified the time and expense in creating it. The 
              Internet is stimulating many institutions to organize their records, 
              to record their artifacts properly, to undertake research projects 
              that would previously have been considered unnecessarily specialized, 
              and to make available to the public previously behind-the-scenes 
              activities, conservation perhaps most notably.</p>
            <p>I hasten to reaffirm that the least adventurous uses of technologically 
              may, in many disciplines, be the most valuable. The fact that such 
              uses may consist in simply making information in a few specialized 
              locations available internationally does not diminish the importance 
              of this use. It may be less fascinating technologically, but it 
              is often of immense value.</p>

            <p><b>Lists of web sites with hotlinks</b></p>
            <p>Possibly the most used sites in each discipline are the lists of 
              organizations in each subject area, with urls and hotlinks. In conservation 
              and historic preservation, there are a number of exemplary, well-known 
              lists, and these lead quickly to other sites with their own lists 
              and hotlinks. One might begin with:<br>
              &nbsp;<br>

            <p>These lists overlap in endless ways and may seem unnecessarily 
              repetitive, but the different organization of each site is instructive 
              and each has different types of peripheral links, demonstrating 
              once again the immense value of internet diversity, often mistakenly 
              described as chaos.</p>

              As reaffirmed above, simply making previously local information 
              available internationally can be among the most important uses of 
              the Internet. The web is filled with such information, sites often 
              without a single image or hotlink, yet these pages are sometimes 
              written with the highest standards. This makes possible the distribution 
              of conservation information on an impressive range of specialized 
              topics. There is a site detailing "How to Collect Archaeological

            <p>The site includes a few excellent before-and-after examples of 
              digital restoration of faded photographs, faded 16mm color movie 
              frames, and broken glass pieces <a target="_blank" href="../http://www.foto.unibas.ch/research/examples.html">http://www.foto.unibas.ch/research/examples.html</a>, 
              but these few illustrations are quite secondary to the extensive 
              text, providing a clearly organized, detailed introduction to the 
              subject, plus three lengthy papers, two previously published in 
              scholarly journals, one given at a scholarly conferences.</p>
            <p>This calls to our attention the fact that it is now feasible to 
              publish on the web out of print books and articles previously published 
              in journals with limited circulation. Perhaps more importantly, 
              one can publish on the web important but specialized texts that 
              would not otherwise be published at all. This is especially valuable 
              in fields, such as conservation, where there is a large body of 
              highly specialized material, but where there is relatively little 
              funding.</p>
            <p><b><a href="#toc" name="2a3">2.A.3. Charts and forms </a></b></p>
            <p>It would be of immense value if templates could be developed for 
              a variety of museum and conservation purposes, discussed, improved, 
              and agreed upon by professionals in the field, then made available 
              on the Web. This would make sharing of information more efficient 
              and reliable (we do not all take measurements or record data in 
              the same way, but this is not clear from a simple catalogue entry) 
              and would encourage conservators and historical preservationists 
              to study and record aspects of artifacts that they might otherwise 
              overlook.</p>

              the overpainting removed, and finally after inpainting. There are

              infrared, and x-ray, with a final image verso. See also the Fall

              somewhat compensated for by helpful details (on the web pages) or 
              outstanding quality digital images (at the kiosk).</p>
            <p>It is worth noting that even the best of these web sites do not 
              provide the option of opening a large, high-resolution image. Yet 
              it is quite easy and inexpensive to do this, and where would such 
              images be more useful that in explanations of technical examination

            <p><b><a href="#toc" name="2c">2.C. Images </a></b></p>
            <p>Of all the uses of the Internet in the field of art conservation 
              and historic preservation, the sharing of images offers the greatest 
              potential benefits. Conservation and historic preservation concern 
              themselves not only with scientific data but also with historical 
              change and broad social issues, but all of these are focused on 
              physical objects, objects which for one reason or another are highly 
              valued by society. In nearly all cases, the visual appearance of 
              these artifacts and buildings is a major concern. We are especially 
              concerned with the visual changes these objects have undergone over 
              time and with how we wish them to appear today.</p>
            <p>In order to consider these issues with care, it is essential that 
              we study the objects first hand. Nothing can substitute for the 
              in-depth study of the original objects, buildings and archaeological 
              sites. Especially for those who have not studied paintings in conservation 
              lab with conservators and conservation scientists or climbed around 
              cathedral vaults with engineers and stone technology experts, the 
              primacy of direct study of the original cannot be stressed too often. 
              Without study of the original, it is even difficult to understand 
              the other evidence.</p>
            <p>But some aspects of their visual appearance are not available to 
              us. We cannot recapture the appearance of objects from times past, 
              nor can we see with our naked eyes the appearance of objects activated 
              by thermal neutrons. For these we are dependent on various types 
              of documents, especially images: 16th century drawings of famous 
              buildings, the working drawings of sculptors, nineteenth century 
              photographs, and autoradiographs of paintings. Moreover, it is not 
              possible to return to the Louvre or Kyoto every time we wish to 
              reconsider some aspect of the artifact or building. We are heavily 
              dependent on images.</p>
            <p>The sites referred to below include some text, but for these sites 
              the focus is clearly on the images.</p>
            <p><b><a href="#toc" name="2c1">2.C.1. Still images</a></b></p>
            <p>The press concerns itself primarily with multimedia developments, 
              understandably because these are the most innovative. For conservation 
              and historic preservation, however, the tremendous increase in the 
              availability of still images, especially high quality images, offers 
              the greatest immediate promise.</p>
            <p><b>Basic compilations</b></p>
            <p>In some cases, these are simply large compilations of images on 
              a defined subject, usually drawing on the research photographs taken 
              by a scholar over the years, now made widely available on the Web. 
              Axel Bolvig, research professor at the Institute of History, University 
              of Copenhagen, has created a web site, "Kalkmalerier i danske kirker" 
              <a target="_blank" href="../http://www.kalkmalerier.dk/">http://www.kalkmalerier.dk/</a>, 
              containing 5230 images of medieval wallpaintings in Danish churches, 
              based on photographs by Bolvig and five other photographers. Although 
              mixed in quality, the images are thoroughly documented and constitute 
              a previously unavailable and impressively comprehensive basis for 
              study of this surprisingly large body of material (and a lovely 
              Danish plainsong plays when one clicks on the angel).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Demonstrations</b></p>
            <p>Some web sites demonstrate not the procedures for actual conservation 
              and restoration but the procedures for virtual restoration, for 
              computer manipulation of the images to show how works would look 
              if restored a certain way. At the Center for Computer-Aided Egyptological 
              Research at the University of Utrecht <a target="_blank" href="../http://www.ccer.ggl.ruu.nl/ccer/default.html">http://www.ccer.ggl.ruu.nl/ccer/default.html</a>, 
              Han van den Berg has created a site describing his virtual restoration 
              of ancient Egyptian artifacts by computer <a target="_blank" href="../http://www.ccer.ggl.ruu.nl/ccer/restore.html">http://www.ccer.ggl.ruu.nl/ccer/restore.html</a>. 
              He provides here six excellent before-and-after examples of his 
              computer restorations, with details. Strangely, he writes that "by 
              means of manipulation of the photographic copy the object is restored 
              to its original and most perfect state, the way it used to be in 
              Ancient Egyptian days." But this is not at all what he has done. 
              In fact these are quite restrained and sensitive computer restorations, 
              in which the attempt is clearly to recapture the visual coherency 
              of the image. None of the examples reveal any attempt to bring the 
              image back to the object's original appearance.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Constructed images (virtual reconstructions)</b></p>
            <p>Learning Sites Inc., <a target="_blank" href="../http://www.learningsites.com/index.htm">http://www.learningsites.com/index.htm</a>, 
              a Williamstown, Mass. company marketing software of "digitally reconstructed 
              ancient worlds for interactive education and research," has parts 
              of several demonstration projects available on their web site. The 
              most extensive is for the Tsoungiza archeological site, from ancient 
              Nemea, in the northeast Peloponnesos of Greece. This includes three 
              constructed views of a house (from above, the front, and the inside), 
              drawn by Danial J. Pullen, Department of Classics, Florida State 
              University, Tallahassee, includes large, high resolution images 
              of the Tsoungiza site, with aerial photographs of site features 
              superimposed on drawn plans of a succession of eight periods uncovered 
              during the excavation. It is unfortunate that the case for virtual 
              recreations is so overstated in the company's accompanying text 
              ("Computer technology can reunite elements from disparate locations 
              into a single model, creating a near first-hand experience of an 
              ancient world in its original complexity."), but the educational 
              value of digitally constructed, three-dimensional images of no-longer 
              existent buildings and archaeological sites, based on the most reliable 
              evidence is clear.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Laboratory quality images</b></p>
            <p>A distinctive need for advanced work in art conservation and for 
              certain aspects of historic preservation is the availability of 
              high quality images. For modern laboratory purposes images must 
              be of extremely high quality and the exact methods by which the 
              images were made recorded. For this reason, standards for various 
              types of architectural rendering and photographic recording are 
              gradually being developed in this field. Moreover, if we are to 
              confer with experts in different parts of the world, reproductions 
              of these images must also be of very high quality. In the past this 
              has required use of the mails, physical transfer of photographs, 
              x-radiographs, etc. from one conservation center or technical lab 
              or to another, with the result that only the most important images 
              have been shared and of course without the immediacy of common discovery. 
              No form of telefax or other electronic transmission has been adequate 
              for the high quality, reliable images needed.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;High quality digital images offer, for the first time, the 
              potential (already realized in a few high tech labs, though perhaps 
              not yet with the comprehensive controls needed for the most reliable 
              joint experiments) for experts in various parts of the world to 
              look at and discuss in real-time the same images, confident that 
              they are seeing exactly the same image under similar conditions.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              <b><a href="#toc" name="2f">2.D. Additional needs </a></b></p>
            <p>&nbsp;The success of these types of internet sites should encourage 
              us to pursue databases that have been discussed from time to time 
              but have never been taken on by any individual or, more desirably, 
              any institution. One project that at least got underway was begun 
              in 1980 by Joyce Hill Stoner at the Winterthur Art Conservation 
              Program, Delaware, and lasted until 1994. Titled "The Artists' Techniques 
              Data Base", it eventually included more than a hundred entries about 
              artist's intent concerning varnish, etc., compiled from various 
              sources including discussions with artists&nbsp;<a name="[2]"></a><a href="#(2)">&#91;3&#93;</a>.</p>
            <p>Dr. Stoner tells me that, in 1994, three sets of 430 pages of entries 
              were sent off to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 
              the Tate Gallery, London, and the Getty Conservation Institute, 
              now in Los Angeles.</p>
            <p>I have suggested two comparable databases, both of which seem worthy 
              of institutional sponsorship now that the Internet provides for 
              efficient, long-term development and prompt, wide-spread availability 
              of the information. In a 1984 document for a colloquium at the Center 
              for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, National Gallery of Art, 
              Washington, D.C., I recommended the creation of comprehensive archives 
              of information on the working procedure of individual artists and 
              on the visual appearance and physical character of their art&nbsp;<a name="[3]"></a><a href="#(3)">&#91;4&#93;</a>.</p>
            <p>If such an archive of information (which we would now call a "database") 
              were readily available for an artist, standard procedure would call 
              for the information to be consulted by curators and conservators, 
              even in provincial museums, before deciding how any work of art 
              should be treated or displayed; and art historians could be expected, 
              more than is now the case, to consult such information in interpreting 
              works by the artist.</p>
            <p>In order that such information could be stored and retrieved in 
              a convenient, common-sense manner, I suggested that the data be 
              organized according to the various types of sources from which information 
              had been obtained, following an outline such as this:</p>
            <p>I. INFORMATION FROM ORIGINAL PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS</p>
            <blockquote>A. Normal Viewing 
              <blockquote>1. Records of direct observation under normal conditions<br>
                2. Photographs and slides taken under normal conditions</blockquote>
              <p>B. Laboratory Examination</p>
              <blockquote>1. Written reports of examination under laboratory conditions, 
                with binocular microscopes, ultraviolet light, analyzing paint 
                samples, etc. 
                <p>2. X-radiographs, infra-red reflectograms, neutron activated 
                  autoradiographs, photographs under raking light, etc.</p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p>II. INFORMATION FROM ACCESSORY OBJECTS</p>
            <blockquote>A. Equipment Used by the Artist<br>
              B. Representations of the Artist at Work</blockquote>
            <p>III. INFORMATION FROM CONTEMPORARY WRITTEN DOCUMENTS</p>
            <blockquote>A. Correspondence, Inscriptions, etc. in the Artist's 
              Hand.<br>
              B. Eyewitness Accounts, Reviews<br>
              C. Other Contemporary Reports</blockquote>
            <p>Parallel to this archive or database, I have recommended the establishment 
              of a directory of prime objects, listing, for each artist, those 
              works of art which could serve as touchstones for the study and 
              conservation of other works by the same artist. For the identification 
              of these prime objects, we would have to depend on those art historians 
              and conservators who have specialized in the work of individual 
              artists, those who have seen most of the artist's extant work, have 
              examined a significant number out of their frames in conservation 
              labs, have studied the available laboratory reports, have conferred 
              regularly with other experts in the field, have observed works by 
              the artist being treated in a variety of ways in conservation studios 
              or, in the case of conservators, have themselves treated a significant 
              number of objects by the artist. It would be especially important 
              to record those works that have survived with relatively little 
              natural deterioration or human intervention, that is paintings that 
              have not been relined, especially where the imposto has not been 
              compressed.</p>
            <p>The need for these two databases gains in urgency as painting after 
              painting, sculpture after sculpture, and building after building 
              is cleaned and restored. Fortunately, the job of creating such databases 
              and of making them available at least to other experts is now a 
              vastly more practical enterprise, because of the Internet. These 
              databases could be formulated, built gradually over the years, and 
              made available immediately to those in charge of the conservation 
              and preservation of our cultural heritage. Also, aspects of these 
              databases would be invaluable in formulating exhibitions focusing 
              on "Art in the Making" and in meeting the increasing public interest 
              in conservation .</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, there are other types of additional needs which should 
              be discussed among conservation and historic preservation professionals 
              in order to recommend the types of internet uses that would best 
              provide for the preservation of the world's cultural heritage.</p>

            <p><b><a href="#toc" name="3a">3.A. Web sites with relatively permanent 
              information </a></b></p>
            <p>&nbsp;The permanence of information on the Internet is one of the 
              central concerns of those involved in setting internet policies, 
              of librarians, archivists and - too often forgotten - end users. 
              Especially where major databanks are concerned, it is essential 
              that the institutions and persons responsible commit themselves 
              to maintaining a permanent record, which of course requires a commitment 
              to transpose data into new formats as they replace those currently 
              in use, and to document this evolution so that it can be confirmed 
              by later researchers.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;<b>Individual databases</b></p>
            <p>The individual databases within the conservation and preservation 
              field are large and comprehensive in some cases, small and narrowly 
              focused others. SOS (Save Outdoor Sculpture) <a href="../http://www.nic.org/sos/sos.html" target="_top">http://www.nic.org/sos/sos.html</a>, 
              is "a private/public initiative to document all monuments and outdoor 
              sculpture in the United States." As reported on the SOS web site, 
              "In Phase I, 6,000 volunteers reported 30,000 publicly accessible 
              outdoor sculptures to the Smithsonian Institution's Art Inventories 
              datebase. Of that total, 45 percent were determined to be in critical 
              need of attention, nine percent requiring urgent treatment to survive 
              the coming century. In Phase II, SOS!2000, those volunteers and 
              other citizens . . . are working to preserve 10,000 sculptures and 
              monuments as a gift for the next century... Education about the 
              necessity of maintainance is a common message throughout Phase II."<br>
              The SOS records are searchable as part of the <a target="_blank" href="../http://www.siris.si.edu/">Smithsonian 
              Institution's Art Inventories Catalog</a>.</p>
            <p>Much more narrowly focused, but equally thorough within its area, 
              is the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB), <a target="_blank" href="../http://tree.ltrr.arizona.edu/~grissino/itrdb.htm">http://tree.ltrr.arizona.edu/~grissino/itrdb.htm</a> 
              providing "the only central repository for all types of dendrochronological 
              data from around the world." "Currently, the ITRDB contains over 
              6,000 data sets, including 2,804 raw measurement files, 3,275 tree-ring 
              chronologies, and numerous climate reconstructions derived from 
              these tree-ring data. These data were collected from over 1,500 
              sites around the world representing over 100 tree and shrub species." 
              It is reassuring to read that "the primary purpose for the ITRDB 
              is to provide a permanent location for the storage of well-dated, 
              high-quality dendrochronological data from around the world", and 
              "to assimilate tree-ring measurement and chronology data into a 
              central location for permanent archiving." Now housed at World Data 
              Center-A for Paleoclimatology at the National Geophysical Data Center 
              (NGDC) in Boulder, Colorado, USA, ITRDB records are freely available 
              to anyone with access to the Internet.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;<b><a href="#toc" name="6">4. CONCLUSIONS </a></b></p>
            <p>&nbsp;A series of observations emerge from an exploration of the 
              interplay between web technology and discipline-specific content 
              in the field of art conservation and historic preservation. First, 
              it is important to reemphasize that there is no correlation between 
              degrees of technological complexity and content value. Simply having 
              an important new idea and making it available in a report on the 
              Internet may have more value for the preservation of our cultural 
              heritage than the most complex technological innovation. At the 
              same time, the immense technological advantages of the Internet 
              are having a profound effect on this field and it behooves us to 
              consider in what ways we might take advantage of these technological 
              wonders and in what ways the development of the Internet might itself 
              be stimulated by the potential for new uses in conservation and 
              historic preservation.</p>
            <p>Most internet uses that we have reviewed are common to all disciplines. 
              Indeed we have argued that the relatively simple development of 
              immense databases which can be accessed as needed for information 
              of all types, a use common to all disciplines, is possibly the single 
              most valuable feature of the Internet as it now exists or as we 
              may conceive it in the future. The repository of human knowledge 
              is growing at an astonishing rate, especially in fields such as 
              conservation which depend on detailed and often specialized materials 
              science.</p>
            <p>However, some uses of the Internet, although not unique to conservation 
              and historic preservation, are especially valuable because of the 
              character of the field. In this, we have found striking parallels 
              with some of the sciences, especially medicine.</p>
            <p>Most notably, conservation is dependent on photographic images, 
              especially large, high resolution images. Moreover, these need to 
              be taken not only by natural light but also under various laboratory 
              lighting conditions, such as x-rays and infra-red light, not to 
              mention neutron activated autoradiography. We need the conditions 
              under which these photographs are taken to be carefully recorded, 
              the process by which the images are digitized to be known and recorded, 
              and we need any alteration in the digital images to be carefully 
              tracked. We must know exactly what we are looking at, what we can 
              depend on and what not.</p>
            <p>In order to share these images over the Internet with other experts, 
              we need to have a system which allows us to be certain that experts 
              in different locations are looking at exactly the same image under 
              as nearly similar conditions as can be achieved.</p>
            <p>Because we are dealing with one-of-a-kind objects, some of which 
              cannot be moved (buildings and cultural landscapes), and others 
              of which are too fragile to move, it is especially important that 
              experts in other parts of the world be able to study these images 
              and to share their observations in as collegial and confidential 
              a manner as possible. This requires real-time collaboration and 
              absolute confidentiality. For these reasons and others, the development 
              of next generation internets is crucial to research in conservation 
              just as it is in medicine and military research. We need to be able 
              to carry out joint experiments, using expensive, specialized equipment 
              perhaps located in only one or two laboratories.</p>
            <p>At the same time, we need to take advantage of the Internet as 
              it now exists and is evolving for most of the needs in the field. 
              Public education, so essential in the drive to save what remains 
              of the world's cultural heritage, requires use of the modes of communication 
              available to the largest numbers of people. We must also be able 
              to reach people in distant locals, quickly, especially when emergencies 
              require immediate advice. In this also, we can follow the lead of 
              the medical profession, which is already making emergency medical 
              advice available to people in the outbacks.</p>
            <p>To return finally to images, the recognized need for the ability 
              to search images by visual characteristics is one of the challenges 
              that the field of art conservation and historic preservation poses 
              for the field of computer technology.</p>
