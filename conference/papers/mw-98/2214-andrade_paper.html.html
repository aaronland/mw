                      the second information revolution. This new generation of 
                      products is helping not only to integrate multimedia into 
                      existing environments, but to reengineer work processes. 
                      At the very least, multimedia and imaging applications are 
                      enriching existing applications by integrating images, voice, 
                      and video. More important, they are helping us to rethink 
                      information processing in various applications and, with 
                      the introduction of multimedia computing, to revolutionarize

          <b><i><font face="Arial">1 - Introduction</font></i></b> 
          <p>This work describes the elaboration of a multimedia information system 
            for research and popularization through World Wide Web of collections 
            of historical documents belonging to the Arquivo P&uacute;blico Mineiro 
            (Minas Gerais Public Archive). 
          <p>The main objective of the development of the system is to increase 
            the process of informatization of the Arquivo P&uacute;blico Mineiro 
            what stores about 1600 linear meters of administrative and historical 
            documentation on the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. 
          <p>This paper addresses the use of new computer science technologies 
            for storage and processing of multimedia data as images, video, audio 
            and free texts (GHAFOOR, 1995), once these means of information representation 
            generally compose the collections of a public archive. <br>
            &nbsp; 
          <p><b><i><font face="Arial">2-Complex Data and Multimedia Information 
            Systems</font></i></b> 
          <p>Nowadays we live together with a series of communication ways and 
            information as the image, the sound, the movement, the free text, 
            deeply inherent to the senses, to the spirit, to the history and the 
            human knowledge. These types of data are extremely rich, capable to 
            express quantitative or qualitative information in a friendly way 
            and with immediate perception for the user. They are, most of the 
            time, atavics<b> </b>and universals and their understanding is within 
            reach of the human being, independent of social, political, ethnic 
            and cultural factors. 
          <p>In the entertainment, in the learning, in the arts, in the communication, 
            in the trade, in the sciences, those forms of information execute 
            important and preponderant functions. 
          <p>From the beginning, in the fifties, until the current days, most 
            of the automated systems of information have used a restricted data 
            type: the classic or conventional data, composed by a limited chain 
            of alphanumeric symbols representing names, codes, measures, amounts 
            or values (ELSMARI, 1994; KORTH, 1995). 
          <p>The forms of representation of information as image, audio, and video 
            possess much more complex structure than the small chains of letters 
            and numbers. Therefrom the pertinence of the denomination "complex 
            data" generally used to make allusion for those types of data in the 
            ambit of the Computer Science. 
          <p>Complex data still have small representativeness in the storage and 
            management structures and in the available processing tools in the 
            commercial market of computer science, mainly if we consider information 
            systems that need to manipulate great amounts of those data. It is 
            still a segment under domain of the academic research and of the construction 
            of prototypes and first commercial products in the industrial area. 
          <p>The inclusion, although incipient, of those "new data" in the context 
            of the computer science, has turned the development of information 
            systems less restricted and closer to the real world, facilitating 
            the human's interaction with the machine and propitiating a better 
            level of information, knowledge and understanding of the reality. 
            It is not for free the popular dictation: "an image is worth more 
            than 1000 words". 
          <p>Multimedia is a new branch in Computer Science. We can date its beginning 
            in the last years of the eighties, and its real technological and 
            commercial evolution starting from 1993 (YOSHIDA, 1994). This way 
            it is premature to demand accuracy in its concepts and maturity in 
            its methods and tools. Precise definition does not exist for multimedia, 
            it remains, in this segment, a great dose of uncertainty and confusion 
            (RODRIGUEZ, 1995). The term that until few years ago it had no mean 
            became too including (SUTHERLAND, 1995). Still in agreement with RODRIGUEZ 
            (1995) multimedia expanded and turned out to be a field that challenges 
            rigorous definitions. For NEWTON (1997) a lot of people still visualize 
            multimedia as a diversified group of technologies looking for a purpose. 
          <p>As the own name reveals, multimedia involves several media types, 
            that is to say, several ways to represent and to divulgate the information. 
            Those several media types include image, graph, animation, video, 
            free text, audio, each one with its specific properties. However, 
            multimedia data have a common characteristic concerning its representation 
            in computer: the need of considerable storage volume (DAVID,1996). 
            Those data make intensive use of the primary and secondary storage 
            means: volatile memory, magnetic disks, optic disks. As, more and 
            more, these types of data travel through networks widely distributed 
            as the Internet, powerful compression algorithms and high performance 
            network systems are necessary (KHOSAFIAN, 1996). 
          <p>Independent of the existence of an accurate definition multimedia, 
            ratifying HOLSINGER (1996), is one of the most powerful ways, on humanity's 
            disposition, to communicate ideas, to present information and to experiment 
            new concepts. KHOSHAFIAN (1996) has similar perception: "multimedia 
            is the richest and expressive form to represent and interact with 
            the information". And he complements asserting to be the multimedia 
            an irreversible tendency in Computer Science and, in the future<b>,</b> 
            responsible for a dramatic revolution in the interaction between the 
            man and the machine. For MORAN (1995), the multimedia technology is 
            capable to modify our relationship with the world, the perception 
            of the reality, the integration of the time within the space. The 
            communication becomes more sensorial, multidimensional and non-linear. 
            There is a reenchantment for that technology because it allows a much 
            more intense interaction between the real and the virtual. RODRIGUEZ 
            (1995) advances that we are destined to become a society that uses 
            (and, perhaps, depends of) a plethora of multimedia applications that 
            will execute in personal or professional computers and in television 
            equipment. The perception of those and other authors (DAVID, 1996; 
            ROSEMBORG, 1993) shows clearly the importance of the multimedia computing. 
          <p>Multimedia information systems use concurrently several types of 
            multimedia data being capable to organize, to synchronize and to present 
            that complex and including group of information in an interactive 
            way (DAVID,1996; KHOSAFIASN, 1996, GROSKY, 1994,1997). According to 
            ADJEROH (1997) those systems are characterized by the integration 
            of different types of multimedia data originating from several sources. 
            MARCUS (1996) emphasizes that although a considerable volume work 
            on multimedia already exists, produced in the last years, only a small 
            part specifically refers to multimedia information systems. 
          <p>These information systems are not limited to any application type 
            and any specific area of knowledge. Multimedia applications are useful 
            for several types of users and professionals: students, educators, 
            doctors, economists, engineers, executives, artists, researchers, 
            scientists, etc. They are also important for the entertainment. This 
            way, the evolution of multimedia is interesting for all the segments. 
          <p>Multimedia applications can be found where exists the need to manage 
            complex data. As classic examples can be mentioned the education areas 
            (local and distance training, digital libraries), health (database 
            of medical images), entertainment (games, video on demand, interactive 
            TV) and business (videoconference, electronic trade). 
          <p>The Internet and the multimedia walk for an inseparable partnership. 
            A variety of tools and techniques are being developed to support multimedia 
            in network systems (EARNSHAW, 1997). A good example for that is INTERNET-2, 
            an alternative network for high-speed multimedia applications, already 
            initiated<b> </b>in United States. Languages as JAVA and VRML (Virtual 
            Reality Modeling Language) are good as platforms for the development 
            of sophisticated applications based on the World Wide Web (WWW). 
          <p>The association of multimedia database management systems with the 
            Internet is of special interest for the information systems addressed 
            for museums and other institutions in charge of the guard and popularization 
            of art works and historical documents (LINS, 1995; LANZELLOTE). These 
            conjugated technologies have a great potential to enlarge and to democratize 
            the access to the humanity's cultural patrimony as asserts BESSER 
            (1995): "few technologies have offered as much potential to change 
            research and teaching in the arts and humanities as digital imaging. 
            The possibility of examining rare and unique objects outside the secure, 
            climate-controlled environments of museums and archives liberates 
            collections from around the world breaks down physical barriers to 
            access, and the potential of reaching audiences across social and 
            economic boundaries blurs the distinction between the privileged few 
            and the general public". <br>

          <p>A public archive is defined as the group of produced or received 
            documents by government institutions due to their specific, administrative, 
            judiciary or legislative functions (Arquivo ...., 1996). In agreement 
            with the same source, document is an information register independent 
            of the physical media that contains it. 
          <p>The growing demand for complete and easily recoverable information 
            of great archives provoked the appearance of methods and advanced 
            technologies in the field of the digitizing, storage, recovery and 
            presentation of images and other types of historical documents (Arquivo 
            ..., 1995). 
          <p>Public archives or other collections maintaining institutions face 
            several problems, due generally to the great accumulation of documents 
            and their fragility, standing out the risk of degradation of the originals 
            due to their direct and frequent manipulation, and of the difficulty 
            of access to the information by the researchers and the public in 
            general (Arquivo ..., 1995; ARA&Uacute;JO, 1992). Mentioning GARCIA 
            (1994) on the digitizing work of the Archivo General de Indias in 
            Spain: "the free access to the papers has driven to what is denominated 
            the 'users inflation' in the reading rooms, inflation that visibly 
            is producing more damages in the documents than those produced by 
            the simple up to now to pass of time. In the Archivo General de Indias 
            there are documents that can be handled more than fifty times with 
            different objectives along the year. What would happen with them if 
            the appropriate measures were not taken?" <br>

          <p><a name="figure1"></a>It is more and more accentuated, in the current 
            days, the use of data processing systems in the several activities

            with the objective to offer efficient and effective results in the

            the needs and the citizen's social and political rights. 
          <p>The Arquivo P&uacute;blico Mineiro (APM) is a centennial institution 
            founded on July 11, 1895 by the state law number 126. It worked up 
            to 1902 in the historical city of Ouro Preto, when it was transferred 
            to Belo Horizonte, the recently built capital of the state of Minas 
            Gerais<b> </b>(Arquivo... ,1996). Nowadays the Arquivo P&uacute;blico 
            Mineiro is tied up to the Secretaria da Cultura and is installed at 
            a listed building registered by the Historical Patrimony (<a href="figure1.html">figure 
            1</a>). 
          <p>Its objective is: to "pick up, to guard and to conserve produced 
            and accumulated documents by the organs of the public state administration, 
            guaranteeing to the citizens full access to them " (Arquivo ..., 1996). 
          <p>It possesses a collection composed of textual and special documents. 
            For these last ones it can be understood: proceedings, cuttings, posters, 
            films, pictures, maps and plants. The collection includes documents 
            from the XVIII, XIX and XX centuries (Arquivo ..., 1996). 
          <p>APM possesses now about ten million documental pages classified in 
            the following way (Arquivo ..., 1995): <br>

          <b><i><font face="Arial">5 - Objects Model of the Arquivo P&uacute;blico 
          Mineiro</font></i></b> 
          <p>The "acervo" (set of collections) of the Arquivo P&uacute;blico Mineiro 
            is divided in collections or funds. Several types of collections exist: 
            textual, photographic, etc. 
          <p><a name="figure2"></a>Each collection, seeking to facilitate the 
            research and in agreement with its cataloguing, is divided in series 
            and subseries, the division being used for chronological series. The 
            collection, as well as its series and subseries, are composed by documents. 
            A document is formed by one or more " document component " that can 
            be a text, an image, a video, an audio recording or any type of information 
            independent of its media. 
          <p>The diagram of objects shown in the <a href="figure2.html">figure 
            2</a>, based on the object-guided methodology OMT (RUMBAUGH, 1994), 
            illustrates this situation. The multimedia information system implemented 
            starting from this model tries to provide great flexibility in the 
            consultation and recovery of referring information to the collections 
            of a public archive. <br>
            <b><i><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></i></b> 
          <p><b><i><font face="Arial">6 - The Multimedia Information System</font></i></b> 
          <p>The development of a prototype seeking to motivate an informatization 
            project of the Arquivo P&uacute;blico Mineiro tries to make compatible 
            new technologies in Computer Science, mainly those based on multimedia 
            databases and multimedia information systems, with the specific needs 
            of a public archive in the conservation of the documental collections 
            under its guard and at the same time to turn it available to the public. 
          <p>The authors tried to model a system guided to easy use and flexibility 
            in recovering historical documents and correlated information. This 
            system could assist the researcher with deep knowledge of the researched 
            object and also the laic, curious on a certain subject. 
          <p>The Internet, due to its extraordinary diffusion for everyone, is 
            considered an excellent way for knowledge popularization and for the 
            democratization of the access to the information. For this reason 
            the developed application has chosen WWW as the main access path to 
            the historical documents. 
          <p>The used tools for storage and management and for processing of the 
            digitized documents were selected by their technological updating, 
            interaction capacity with complex data as free texts and images and 
            also for their integration with the Internet through the use of browsers 
            such as Netscape from Netscape Communications Corp. and MS-Explorer 
            from Microsoft Corp. 
          <p>Thus, after a search in the market, the following group of software 
            was chosen: 
          <ul>
            <li> Object oriented database management system (OODBMS) Jasmine, 
              supplied by Computer Associates International Inc. (CAI) and Fujitsu 
              Inc. in evaluation period (McCRIGHT, 1997). Chosen by representing 
              the state of the art in DBMS (its commercial version was only released 
              in January of this year), being completely object oriented, with 
              Web support and capable to work with great volume of complex data 
              (CRAIG, 1997; FRANK,1997);</li>
            <li> Jasmine Development Environment (JADE), applications generating 
              system in Jasmine, from CAI (BOOKER, 1997);</li>
            <li> Java from Sun Microsystems Inc., a programming language designed 
              primarily for writing software to WWW (NEWTON, 1997);</li>
            <li> Java Proxies (JP), supplied by Technology Deployment International 
              Inc. A product developed by the partnership with CAI, it works as 
              the middleware between Jasmine DBMS and the Java interface;</li>
            <li> Interface using the Java language, chosen due to its portability 
              and web support;</li>
            <li> Symantec's Visual Cafe Pro from Symantec Corp., a rapid application 
              development tool (RAD) for Java (MARTIN, 1997);</li>
            <li> Digital image processing system developed by the Digital Image 
              Processing Nucleus - NPDI of the Federal University of Minas Gerais 
              (UFMG);</li>
            <li> Browser for Web access, such as Netscape or MS-Explorer with 
              Java support (DeVONEY, 1997).</li>
          </ul>
          &nbsp;The use OODBMs is justified by the best adaptation of the object 
          oriented data model in relation to complex data representation than 
          the other data models, such as, for example, the relational model, usually 
          implemented in DBMSs (FOLEY, 1996; PAZANDAK, 1997; GROSKY, 1989). 
          <p>On the other hand, OODBMS is still emergent in the commercial market 
            of software, becoming an useful investigative process to observe the 
            behavior of this tool in a practical application as shown in this 
            work (FRANK, 1995). Jasmine implements the basic concepts of object 
            orientation such as encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, reuse 
            and aggregation. 
          <p>The use of a database management system also gives larger dynamism 
            to the application since each new document incorporated to the database 
            becomes immediately available for consultation. 
          <p>Several research methods were implemented using the database management 
            system potentialities: 
          <ul>
            <li> Searches through the series and subseries in the way that a collection 
              is classified. The researcher navigates in the system through virtual 
              catalogs selecting his documents of interest;</li>
            <li> Keyword searches that guide the user for a certain subject, event, 
              person, etc;</li>
            <li> Textual searches through any word or expression present in one 
              or more document description.</li>
          </ul>
          &nbsp;<a name="figure3"></a>Besides the research methods, topics were 
          incorporated to the information system with multimedia and hypertext 
          support, containing additional information, biographies, bibliographies 
          and glossary about themes inherent to the searched collection. 
          <p><a href="figure3.html">Figure 3</a> schematically illustrates the 
            browsing levels allowed by the system: 
          <p>Summarizing, the implementation of this informatization<b> </b>project 
            is justified for several reasons: 
          <ul>
            <li> It preserves the original collection of a public file, avoiding 
              the direct handling of the documents and their misleading;</li>
            <li> It facilitates the consultation of digitized documents through 
              different search methods, allowing the simultaneous access for several 
              users in geographically different places;</li>
            <li> It facilitates to improve the quality of the documents presented 
              to the user and to enhance interesting aspects of them with the 
              use of digital image processing techniques (DIP), such as brightness 
              and contrast control and borders enhancement, without altering the 
              original digitized document;</li>
            <li> It implements alternative search methods as textual and keyword 
              search, besides the habitual catalogs use<b>;</b></li>
            <li> It allows the use of hypertext, making the searches more dynamic 
              and friendly;</li>
            <li> It allows several methods of remote and local access as Internet, 
              Intranet, CD-ROM, DVD, workstations and local networks.</li>

          <b><i><font face="Arial">7 - Arthur Bernardes Historical Collection</font></i></b> 
          <p>As a prototype, the system presently contemplates just one of the 
            historical collections of the Arquivo P&uacute;blico Mineiro, the 
            collection of Dr. Arthur da Silva Bernardes. 
          <p>Arthur Bernardes, Brazilian statesman, born in 1875 and died in 1955, 
            was President of the Minas Gerais State in the 1918-1922 period, Brazilian 
            President in the 1922-1926 period, senator of the Republic and several 
            times federal deputy, being one of the most important persons of the 
            beginning of the Brazilian Republican history in the first decades 
            of this century (MAGALH&Atilde;ES, 1973; MONTEIRO, 1994; AMORA, 1964). 
          <p>The choice owed, besides the character's relevance, to the fact that 
            his collection is rich and completely classified, being constantly 
            researched. It is composed of a variety of types of hand written and 
            printed historical documents, as pamphlets, cuttings, pictures, correspondences 
            and even films representing well an archivistic collection. 
          <p><a name="figure4"></a>Since it is a very extensive collection<b>,</b> 
            a selection was made among the documents, choosing the most important 
            ones, in way as to portray all the character's biography, the historical 
            period in what he lived and including all types of documents. Emphasis 
            was given to the photographic collection: about 300 photos, dated 
            from 1893 up to 1955, were selected in an universe of more than one 
            thousand and two hundred pictures. 
          <p><a name="figure5"></a>To avoid their degradation, the selected original 
            documents were photographed in the Arquivo P&uacute;blico Mineiro 
            (<a href="figure4.html">figure 4</a>) and the photographs were scanned 
            through flat or manual scanners and then stored in the database system.

          <p>The prototype of the multimedia information system developed is executing 
            its main purpose of being a catalyst for a larger process of informatization 
            of the Arquivo P&uacute;blico Mineiro. The institution is now looking 
            for partnerships to implement a similar system that contemplates, 
            initially, all its pictures and plants of with more than 20.000 documents. 
          <p>The use of the technology of object oriented multimedia databases 
            in conjunction with World Wide Web was revealed pertinent and interesting 
            for this type of application, in spite of some restrictions and incompatibilities, 
            associated with the incipient stage of many of the used tools, which 
            can be avoided in the future. <br>
