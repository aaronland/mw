            <b>Introduction&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>The introduction of user friendly graphics-based Internet browsers 
              can be viewed as the single most important interface design feature 
              that made the new medium accessible to the general public. We are 
              still in the midst of the explosion of personal, commercial, and 
              educational uses of the World Wide Web. However, in spite of the 
              rapid adoption of the new medium (with the number of users approaching 
              100 million worldwide) it is becoming increasingly evident that, 
              as with any new medium, we know little of its specificities and 
              most effective uses. In this paper the characteristics typical of 
              this new medium and the implications they have for interface design 
              will be outlined. For this purpose the role that museums may play 
              in WWW-based education will be used as an example.&nbsp; 
            <p><i>Some characteristics of the digital medium</i>&nbsp; 
            <p>It is very hard to define the digital medium using solely the vocabulary 
              of technology. From the technical side one can say that the information 
              in this medium is represented and stored in digital form. However, 
              this would make any music compact disc an example of a digital medium, 
              which I do not consider it to be. It is also dangerous to equate 
              this medium with computers because of the firmly embedded traditional 
              notion of the computer as a tool. (<a href="#perrone-ref">4</a>)<a name="perrone"></a>. 
              Thus, my definition of this medium will be a complex one including 
              not only its technological characteristics but also its social and 
              psychological properties.&nbsp; 
            <p>The digital medium has a number of attributes that significantly 
              influence the quality and the nature of the interactions it can 
              support. I will present a short (and by no means exhaustive) list 
              of some of the more representative ones and briefly describe their 
              properties and relevance:&nbsp; 
            <ul>
              <li> endless storage;&nbsp;</li>
              <li> easy access;&nbsp;</li>
              <li> easy copying, reproduction, modification;&nbsp;</li>
              <li> easy searching, classification, reclassification;&nbsp;</li>
              <li> anonymity, pseudonymity;&nbsp;</li>
              <li> intimacy;&nbsp;</li>
              <li> new social/collaborative space;&nbsp;</li>
              <li> history log;&nbsp;</li>
              <li> cumulative knowledge accrual;</li>
            </ul>
            <i>Endless storage</i>. Consisting of millions of interconnected computers, 
            the World Wide Web can be also viewed as an infinite storage space. 
            Having in mind that most of the large museums worldwide exhibit as 
            little as 5% of their collection, this characteristic is of immediate 
            relevance to museums. However, endless storage does not imply immediate 
            usefulness or access.&nbsp; 
            <p><i>Easy access</i>. The digital medium is, relatively speaking, 
              easy to access. Although there are currently huge differences in 
              the Internet access capabilities between developed and developing 
              countries, the investment necessary for modest access capabilities 
              is relatively small.&nbsp; 
            <p><i>Easy copying, reproduction, modification</i>. Digital storage 
              allows for effortless reproduction without degradation of the digital 
              'original'. In fact, in the digital environment information is only 
              rarely transported -- it is rather copied from one carrier to another 
              until it reaches its destination in the same form it originated 
              from. Digital information can be easily 'cloned' to produce any 
              number of (electronically) indistinguishable 'originals'. Reduction 
              of the analog information to discrete units allows easy and effortless 
              mixing of the information that originated from different real-world 
              or digital sources (<a href="#levy-ref">3</a>)<a name="levy"></a>. 
              Thus super-imposing, over- and under-laying, collage building and 
              combining of pixels is trivially easy. Modification of digital representations 
              can also occur in a more direct fashion -- through the direct manipulation 
              of the pixels belonging to a single source. Although this characteristic 
              of the digital environment raises many questions in regard to copyright 
              issues it is also one of the characteristics that may prove to be 
              one of the most potent attributes of the new medium.&nbsp;

          <td width="450"> 
            <p><i>Easy searching, classification, reclassification</i>. Reducing 
              analog information to the common denominator of pixel values makes 
              it easier to classify and search for specific information. Currently, 
              this potential is vastly underutilized due to the lack of adequate 
              search engines -- in fact, most of the searches conducted today 
              are based on classification schemes and 'tagging' of electronic 
              entries. However, there are already examples of crude search engines 
              that use the criteria of pattern similarities within digital representations 
              enabling one to, for example, find all of the images in a virtual 
              repository containing leaf-like structures or human faces. Retrieved 
              entities can be as easily reclassified and the classification stored 
              for future uses and fast recovery. The implications of this are 
              manifold. The user is not anymore constrained by the historical 
              circumstances that led to the establishment of certain collections, 
              or by predetermined choices but can make an original choice which 
              will be governed by his/her personal history and interest (<a href="#getty-ref">2</a>).<a name="getty"></a>&nbsp; 
            <p><i>Anonymity, pseudonymity</i>. In digital environments identity 
              depends on one's wish to create one. This characteristic of the 
              medium has numerous implications and a profound influence on personal 
              experience during digital interactions (<a href="#turkle-ref">8</a>)<a name="turkle"></a>. 
              Most often anonymity is transformed into pseudonymity, where one 
              creates a new digital identity which can be specified by a simple 
              descriptive name or with elaborate textual or pictorial details 
              (avatar). Although in many domains of digital interactions anonymity 
              is fiercely fought against (for example, in the domain of email 
              or commercial exchanges) it has unexpectedly positive aspects and 
              uses in educational contexts. Some educators have already discovered 
              the beneficial uses of anonymity in collaborative learning activities 
              -- where an individual feels protected and freer to express one's 
              views, and where comments and criticism are always addressing the 
              content rather than the author.&nbsp; 
            <p><i>Intimacy</i>. The sense of intimacy in the digital medium comes 
              partially from one's anonymity and also from the strong sense of 
              control one has in this environment. In a matter of seconds one 
              can choose and switch between widely different contexts, make a 
              decision to participate or just to observe, to contribute or to 
              download, to broadcast messages to thousands of individuals or just 
              a select few... This sense of intimacy and control one has over 
              digital representations of works of art can play an important role 
              in establishing a relationship with a work of art, a necessary element 
              of art appreciation.&nbsp; 
            <p><i>New social/collaborative space</i>. The digital medium opens 
              up new possibilities for social and collaborative interactions. 
              These possibilities were first realized (but are only rudimentarily 
              explored) by the corporate sector. This led to the development of 
              a new kind of software -- now known under the name of "groupware". 
              Collaborative action provides a new dimension to the experience 
              of works of art. For example, it allows witnessing and possible 
              collaboration during the actual creation of the work of art. The 
              technique was explored to some extent in the area of literary creations 
              -- John Updike writing the final chapter of his latest novel using 
              the input of the thousands of interested individuals spread all 
              over the globe (<a href="#amazon-ref">1</a>)<a name="amazon"></a>.&nbsp; 
            <p><i>History log</i>. Although one can make the claim that information 
              stored in any medium preserves the past in some way, this is incomparable 
              to the ease and precision with which history can be logged in the 
              digital medium. This is the natural outcome of the fact that the 
              information in this medium is the interaction which makes logging 
              of it a necessary part of the environment. Currently, log files 
              are mostly used for technical purposes: to establish how many individuals 
              visited a site, which files were downloaded most frequently, etc. 
              However, the possibility for digital preservation of past events, 
              for example, of reactions that different individuals had while being 
              exposed to a specific phenomenon carries a huge and as yet untapped 
              pedagogical potential. (examples: follow my footsteps through the 
              virtual gallery.... write a single word that comes to your mind 
              when contemplating a work of art and see how many hundreds? thousands? 
              had the same association...).&nbsp; 
            <p><i>Cumulative knowledge accrual</i>. The accumulation of logged 
              information and the ease with which this information can be filtered, 
              searched and classified at a later date is the basis for cumulative 
              knowledge gain. Some examples of creation of 'knowledge spaces' 
              (<a href="#suthers-ref">7</a>)<a name="suthers"></a> already exist 
              in the academic world and provide good examples of further directions 
              one may exploit in the world of the arts.&nbsp; 
            <p><b>Problems&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>Although it is evident that the new medium can have an enormous 
              influence on educational practices it is still vastly underutilized. 
              This state of affairs is the result of at least two distinguishable 
              types of problems: a) problems related to technology associated 
              with the new medium, and b) problems which arise from misunderstanding 
              and misuse of the new medium.&nbsp; 
            <p><i>Technology related problems</i>&nbsp; 
            <p>Since the new medium is intimately linked with the rapidly changing 
              field of micro-electronics (where new standards are introduced in 
              less-than-year intervals) one would expect that the majority of 
              problems are linked to technology itself. However, this is misleading. 
              Although there are many legitimate technical problems associated 
              with the use of computers in general, in most educational contexts 
              the problems that are perceived as technological in nature are actually 
              problems of interface design. This misperception is especially dangerous 
              because it also offers the illusion of a possible solution through 
              technological advances. Many Web-based curricula that did not fulfill 
              the expectations of their creators are still waiting for more powerful 
              computers, faster Internet connection, real-time streamlined video, 
              etc.&nbsp; 
            <p>The major technology-related problem seems to be not in the domain 
              of hardware but rather in the discrepancy which exists between the 
              technical knowledge of educators and their students. The need for 
              investment into technology-related professional development of educators 
              was even recognized and articulated on the policy-making level in 
              the US (<a href="#report-ref">5</a>)<a name="report"></a>.&nbsp; 
            <p><i>Problems related to the misconceptions about the new medium&nbsp;</i>&nbsp; 
            <p>Misconceptions about the new medium arise most often because of 
              the tendency to treat the digital medium as a slightly different 
              form of existing media. The disastrous effects of such practice 
              can be best seen by looking at the relationship between the print 
              and the digital medium. The idea of an 'electronic book' was born 
              very soon after the introduction of computers into everyday life. 
              It seemed easy and tempting (and besides that, it saves the trees) 
              to make printed information available in electronic form. First 
              attempts copied even the constraints of the original medium -- electronic 
              pages were sequentially numbered and the reader was supposed to 
              read them in order. The ease of information manipulation and navigation 
              in the digital medium soon led to the addition of new features specific 
              to the new medium to electronic books. Most important of them was 
              the introduction of hyperlinks which allowed non-sequential navigation 
              through electronic texts. The first experiments with hypertext were 
              disastrous. Instead of making the transfer of knowledge easier, 
              they made it harder. Hyperlinks allowed the user to jump ahead to 
              the topic of interest but often without enough background information 
              (which would have been supplied in sequential browsing) to understand 
              the text. Several jumps back and forth and the reader was hopelessly 
              lost. We know now that converting printed text into hypertext does 
              not consist only of converting the print into electronic form. In 
              order to be useful hypertexts have to follow their own rules for 
              optimal interaction -- from screen-sized text chunks to the redundant 
              background information provided for hyperlinks and several modes 
              of navigation. Similar misconceptions exist in the domain of art 
              education where most often the creation resembles a digital, hyperlinked 
              art catalogue.&nbsp; 
            <p>There are no easy remedies for the above problems. It is obvious 
              that we need more experiments in order to find optimal ways of using 
              the new medium.&nbsp; 
            <p><b>Implications for interface design</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>What follows is a number of suggestions for pedagogical uses of 
              the digital medium. These suggestions are exploiting the profiled 
              characteristics of the medium in the context of current technological 
              limitations. However, before dealing with specific solutions, it 
              is necessary to mention the most general principles of interface 
              design, often forgotten for the sake of other competing design interests:&nbsp; 
            <ul>
              <li> any procedure and interaction in the digital medium should 
                be easier or faster to execute than the same one using traditional 
                means, or&nbsp;</li>
              <li> the benefits of any interaction in the digital medium should 
                be substantially greater as compared to the same interaction using 
                traditional means, or&nbsp;</li>
              <li> the best solution: less investment, greater benefits;&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            These simple principles can be applied to almost any stage of interface 
            design -- from visual look and feel, to navigational strategies, to 
            the general site organization. Examples include substituting two mouse 
            clicks for one in drop menu choices (often one click for selection, 
            the other one to 'go'), providing alternative navigational routes 
            and shortcuts, or the overview of the whole site structure. The benefits 
            are often psychological and social: being 'invisible' in a room full 
            of people (online 'chat' rooms), having time to compose one's response 
            (email), or to explore at one's own pace (virtual exhibits). However, 
            these benefits are often overlooked in favor of more technical ones 
            (like using cryptic commands for faster file access), which for the 
            average user have no perceived value. The best possible solution is 
            the combination of the two above-mentioned solutions -- greater reward 
            with comparatively less investment. A traditional example would be 
            the ease with which one can 'cut and paste' in a word processor. The 
            general interface suggestion for the design of Web-based art education 
            sites is to minimize the dependence on technology during pedagogical 
            activities. Since the major technical difficulty for the most users 
            connected to the Internet (including the majority of schools) is the 
            narrow-bandwidth and undependable telephone connection this could 
            be achieved in the following ways:&nbsp; 
            <ul>
              <li> by off-line browsing of pre-loaded content;&nbsp;</li>
              <li> creation of hybrid pre-loaded and interactive sites;&nbsp;</li>
              <li> using redundant and interchangeable storage and transportation 
                media;&nbsp;</li>
              <li> modularized content;&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            Although off-line browsing seems to be defeating the point of the 
            Internet connection, in reality the number of really 'interactive' 
            sites is very small. Most often the sites are updated on a weekly 
            or monthly basis. Currently there is a number of programs, popularly 
            known as '<a name="spiders"></a><a href="#spiders-note">spiders</a>' 
            that can be scheduled to automatically download whole WWW sites onto 
            the local hard-drive at scheduled intervals. Subsequent visits to 
            the same site download only the information that was added or changed 
            since the last visit and are executed very quickly. In spite of the 
            abundance of these programs, they are rarely used.&nbsp; 
            <p>Creation of hybrid sites (in terms of information storage and management) 
              resolves the problems of narrow bandwidth while preserving interactivity 
              and 'live' presence. On these sites the high-bandwidth information 
              is downloaded in advance so that the live Internet connection can 
              be used for interactive activities. Unlike the previous solution 
              the creation of such sites depends for the most part on the information 
              provider.&nbsp; 
            <p>Another solution to narrow bandwidth and shortage of local storage 
              space is to provide larger data-base type parts of the Web site 
              (like image collections) on removable storage media (CD ROMs, ZIP 
              disks). All of the above mentioned solutions depend on and are most 
              efficient if the content is modularized.&nbsp; 
            <p>The last, and potentially the most beneficial interface design 
              suggestion is:&nbsp; 
            <ul>
              <li> whenever possible exploit the specific characteristics of the 
                new medium for the creation of new pedagogical paradigms;&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            This, somewhat cryptic directive is also the hardest to implement. 
            In simple words it can be restated as: use the new medium's potential 
            to the full extent. However, it is often hard to predict which design 
            features and interactions are most compatible with the new medium. 
            This knowledge often comes from hindsight. For example, during an 
            experimental college course that used Web-based tools to support collaborative 
            teaching and learning, the students were asked to submit their papers 
            anonymously (<a href="#prince-ref">6</a>)<a name="prince"></a>. The 
            papers were posted on the class Web site so that other students could 
            comment on them (the comments were also anonymous and were appended 
            to the original paper). What struck the instructors was the visible 
            increase in the quality of student writing. In retrospect, it is easy 
            to explain - the students were not writing any more for the instructor 
            but for 'the world'. Protected by their anonymity they could more 
            freely express themselves. Anonymity of papers also allowed the commentators 
            to focus on the content and not the author and again, under the protective 
            shield of anonymity, openly express their opinions. Other positive 
            effects of such a simple Web-based interaction design are surprising 
            and also include:&nbsp; 
            <ul>
              <li> benefits of exposure of individual students to the work of 
                others (which is not usual in traditional coursework);&nbsp;</li>
              <li> instructor's insight not only into the students ability to 
                create, but also in their ability into critically appraise the 
                work of others;&nbsp;</li>
              <li> creation of a database of high quality student papers to serve 
                as future resources and 'standard setters'.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            Again, in retrospect, it is easy to see that this procedure tapped 
            into the several of the mentioned characteristics of the digital medium: 
            anonymity, intimacy, collaborative social space and cumulative knowledge 
            accrual. One can easily imagine similar techniques used in the field 
            of art education&nbsp; 
            <p><b>Conclusion&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; 
            <p>The intimate connection of the digital medium with technology leads 
              to the perception that the existing problems of using this medium 
              in education will be solved through technological advances. It has 
              been suggested that the existing technological problems can be bypassed 
              by adequate design of interaction protocols. The major problems 
              of Web-based (art) education are not technological but psychological 
              in nature. They arise mostly from the attempt to transplant the 
              existing interaction models into the new medium. These models are 
              not only ill-suited for pedagogical purposes but also prevent exploiting 
              the unique characteristics of the digital medium and using them 
              as a basis for the development of the alternative and more efficient 
              educational paradigms.&nbsp; <br>
