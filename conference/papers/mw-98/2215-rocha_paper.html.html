            <h2><a name="SECTION00010000000000000000"></a>Introduction </h2>
            <p>This work is being developed under the GEIRA project, an EC supported 
              project, under the INTERREG II program. The goal of the GEIRA project 
              is the development of a service to support the publication of multimedia 
              information, with respect to science and technology, cultural resources 
              and environment protection in the of North of Portugal and Galiza 
              (North-west Spain). In this paper we will focus on part of the work 
              being done to provide the museums of this region with tools for 
              data management and methodologies that enable the publication of 
              their data, preferably on the Web. </p>
            <p>Most of the existing museums in this region are small with little 
              or no computer-based information support. Only a few have the opportunity 
              to be assisted by a software engineer. Our goal is to get an information 
              system in each museum, running with the minimal external support. 
              It should be as easy as possible to publish information on the Web 
              from that information system. Each museum will have a presence on 
              the Web, as a stand-alone entity.</p>
            <p>The aim of project GEIRA is to provide an additional value to the 
              users searching for information. Instead of iterating through a 
              set of institutions, the user can search and browse in a knowledge 
              level above each particular institution. GEIRA will provide that 
              knowledge level, rather than just aggregate a collection of links 
              in well organized site.</p>

            <h3><a name="SECTION00011000000000000000"></a>About the title</h3>
            <p>The title of this paper reflects our search for knowledge representation 
              models to be applied to museums. We want models rich enough to be 
              applied for both the daily data management and for multimedia publishing, 
              like CD-ROMs and the Web. The knowledge must also be suitable for 
              building relations between heterogeneous sources, like different 
              kinds of museums.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we will present two different approaches for representing 
              museological information: one based on relational databases and 
              the other based on annotated documents. For each, we will try to 
              identify the advantages and the difficulties, resulting in a trade 
              off that should be analyzed before deciding on one of these models. 
              We have found that annotated documents are a suitable data representation 
              for unstructured information, like long descriptions of objects, 
              of archaeological sites, biographies, etc.</p>
            <h3><a name="SECTION00012000000000000000"></a>Structure of the Paper</h3>
            <p>This paper starts by identifying our goal: the development a system 
              that will minimize the museum's effort in order to maintain a presence 
              on the Web. In order to do that, we will analyze two different models 
              of data representation: the relational model, and the use of annotated 
              documents. The relational database model is presented more briefly 
              because it is traditionally used and is already well understood. 
              The second approach will be presented in more detail, with examples 
              of what and how to explore the semantics embedded in the annotations.</p>
            <h2><a name="SECTION00020000000000000000"></a>Relational Database 
              based Knowledge</h2>
            <p>In the context of GEIRA, there was no specific application to support 
              the daily data management activities of the museums so, the first 
              step was the development of one. The design and the development 
              of this application was done for the Windows operating system. The 
              application was written in Delphi, and the data is stored in a relational 
              database. This application runs, typically, on a single or small 
              network of PCs.</p>
            <p>For the definition of the data structures, we followed, as much 
              as possible, the SPECTRUM [<a href="#mda-spectrum"

         name="Ass97">Ass97</a>] recommendations. During the development, we had 
              the support of people from the museums. At this time, the application 
              is ready to be installed, and only minor adjustments are expected. 
              In the next weeks, we will evaluate the application, in daily activity. 
              Meanwhile, we are preparing a technical report about the application 
              built, considering all design and implementation issues. </p>
            <p>For the purpose of this paper, we refer this application as a practical 
              solution to fulfill the needs of museum data management. This application 
              was not written overnight, and some problems had to be solved. But 
              it was not far from the usual development of an interface over a 
              database (the definition of the data structures, the tables of the 
              database and their relations, became easier using SPECTRUM, as we 
              said). The development of this kind of application, built on top 
              of a relational databases is easier due to the set of existing sophisticated 
              and affordable tools, like the Delphi and SQL Server used. This 
              means that, when deciding for this model, we can expect the existence 
              of a rich set of tools.</p>
            <h3><a name="SECTION00021000000000000000"></a>The first Web site</h3>
            <p>To make possible the presence of this variety of museums on the 
              Web, in a systematic way, some alternatives were explored.</p>
            <p>Another team of this project, working on Vila Real, developed a 
              common abstract structure for the museums [<a href="#leonel" name="LC97">LC97</a>]. 
              Each site is then constructed to instantiate that structure.</p>
            <p>The root of each museum starts in a atrium, and then is divided 
              in 5 subsections: collections, activities, free theme 1, free theme 
              2 and contacts. The pages generated for each section are structured 
              with several frames, each with a specific functionality. This mapping 
              between the abstract structure and the concrete HTML pages was done 
              by a multimedia designer.</p>
            <p>To make this model systematic, almost all the information is stored 
              in a relational database, rather then on HTML pages. The pages are 
              dynamically created using Microsoft Active Server Pages. The construction 
              of a new site consists of filling in database fields (with text, 
              images, etc.), rather than writing and composing HTML pages. In 
              this way, the task of building a new site is faster and more accurate. 
              Maintaining the sites is also easier, and can be made by people 
              aware of HTML details.</p>
            <h2><a name="SECTION00030000000000000000"></a>Annotated Documents 
              based Knowledge</h2>
            <p>From the beginning, in parallel, we started the study of SGML [<a href="#Her94" name="Her94foot">Her94</a>], 
              to learn how useful it could be for representing and reasoning on 
              museum data.</p>
            <p>The study we are reporting in this section was carried out to deal 
              with archaeological sites, where museum objects were found. It is 
              being used in a particular museum with thousands of archaeological 
              artifacts. That is why the data (documents) we will use to exemplify 
              some SGML concepts are mostly related to archaeology.</p>
            <p>This data is entered by archaeologists, rather than by the museum 
              staff, but will be available through the museum. The archaeological 
              data will be cross-referenced against information associated with 
              the objects available in the museum collections.</p>
            <p>Cross-referencing the particular information about a museum object, 
              with the information about the archaeological site where it was 
              found, can be useful to create a framework where the full context 
              of that piece can be explained. The precise location of the piece, 
              and even all the archaeological site, can be seen through a GIS 
              (Geographical Information System) plug-in.</p>
            <h3><a name="SECTION00031000000000000000"></a>Writing SGML Documents</h3>
            <p>For this approach, the data should be written as SGML documents. 
              This can be created either by transforming the original documents 
              collected by the archaeologists (in some other format) into SGML, 
              or asking them to use SGML. After showing them how to work with 
              a DTD driven editor, and the benefits of automatic syntax validation 
              along with structural manipulation of text within the editor, it 
              was easy to have archeologists adopt the latter approach.</p>
            <p>Because they used Winword, we have adopted SGML Author from Microsoft, 
              but soon it was clear that it was not a very good option. We changed 
              to Word Perfect, also affordable, which supports SGML more conveniently. 
              Word Perfect has lots of interesting features: automatically highlights 
              violations to the DTD structure, computes a list of the valid choices 
              dependent of the cursor position, has support for tagging non-structured 
              documents, can ask automatically for the values of required attributes, 
              etc.</p>
            <p>The SGML documents are then processed in order to execute, at least, 
              two tasks: to check additional constraints, and to generate HTML. 
              The additional constraints are necessary to ensure consistency among 
              the data. This validation task is only possible when we check the 
              contents of a document compared to others. This validation task 
              and the related discussion about assurance of quality is reported 
              in detail in [<a href="#sgml-97"

         name="RRAH97">RRAH97</a>].</p>
            <p>As said above, the second result of processing the original SGML 
              documents, is the generation of the HTML pages. This is not an assisted 
              step; this is completely automatic, which was one of our strongest 
              requirements. Being automatic does not mean that it is a blind process. 
              We can introduce as much intelligence in this step, as there is 
              knowledge to do so. That knowledge depends on the design of the 
              DTD, and on how the text is being tagged (with more or less detail).</p>
            <h3><a name="SECTION00032000000000000000"></a>Generating HTML pages</h3>
            <p>To do the generation of HTML we had to choose an SGML processing 
              tool. An SGML processing tool can have two "operating modes": transforming 
              and formatting. Although, it seemed that for this task we only need 
              a formatting processor, to meet our goals we also need a transforming 
              processor (to produce different structured views of the data).</p>
            <p>We compared the tools available in order to choose the best for 
              our intended use:</p>
            <dl> 
              <dt><strong>Perl - sgmlspl.pl and SGMLS.pm [<a href="#Meg95" name="Meg95foot">Meg95b</a>], 
                [<a href="#Meg95b" name="Meg95bfoot">Meg95a</a>]</strong> 
              <dd>has the advantage of being freely available; has major drawbacks 
                if you move deep into transforming; programming gets highly complex 
                (ex. processing sub-DTDs). 
              <dt><strong>Omnimark and Balise</strong> 
              <dd>two commercial tools more or less equivalent; the major difference 
                are the conditions of acquisition; Omnimark made a light version 
                freely available that can be used in small to medium projects. 
            </dl>
            <p>We chose Omnimark [<a href="#Omnimark96"

         name="Omn96">Omn96</a>] and we are generating HTML with OMNIMARK scripts. 
              OMNIMARK is a complex processor, focusing on SGML processing. In 
              our case we are just using a small subset of its functionality, 
              mainly 'Down-Translation'.</p>
            <p>Example of a simple script to generate an HTML list of all the 
              entries in the archaeological SGML file:</p>
            <pre>&nbsp;

	DOCUMENT-START

&nbsp;

	  OUTPUT "&lt;UL&gt;%n"

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

	ELEMENT IDENTI

&nbsp;

	  OUTPUT "&lt;LI&gt;%c%n"

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

	ELEMENT #IMPLIED

&nbsp;

	  SUPPRESS

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

	DOCUMENT-END

&nbsp;

	  OUTPUT "&lt;/UL&gt;%n"</pre>
            <p>In this script, before the processing starts ("DOCUMENT-START") 
              we open an HTML list; during processing if we find an element "IDENTI" 
              which identifies an entry we generate a list item ("<code>&lt;LI&gt;</code>") 
              with its contents ("<code>%c</code>"); for all other elements we 
              may find, we will ignore them ("SUPPRESS"); when we reach the bottom 
              of the file we close the HTML list.</p>
            <p>At this point, any person new to SGML document processing can notice 
              a major advantage of keeping documents in SGML. Since we can define 
              DTDs and maintain information according to those, we have a richer 
              format. It becomes very easy to generate a set of different HTML 
              pages for the same SGML document. Those HTML pages can reflect the 
              structure of the source document or have completely new structures. 
              For example, in the above script, we could collect the "IDENTI" 
              elements into an associative array, sort this array, and generate 
              a sorted list of entries (although we are not modifying the structure 
              we are changing content order).</p>
            <p>As a more sophisticated example, we could want a new document having 
              all the entries grouped by geographical areas ("<code>&lt;CONCEL&gt;</code>" 
              - in our SGML files). This would imply reordering and restructuring 
              of the source document.</p>

    AGAIN</pre>
            <p>Moreover, if we distinguish specific visitors, we can generate 
              pages on the fly, according to user attributes, like level of expertise, 
              etc.</p>
            <p>As another example, if we want a LaTeX version of our documents 
              we just have to write a script to do the job.</p>
            <p>The thing that should be reinforced here is that we write all these 
              scripts once. The documents to which they apply can vary in their 
              contents but the scripts will remain functional. If we keep the 
              structure (we do not change the DTD) all the processing remains 
              stable. at the other end, if one of the formats that are being used 
              to present our information (HTML, LaTeX, ...) is upgraded, we only 
              need to change the scripts to reflect this. We do not need to go 
              through all our documentation upgrading texts. SGML is standard 
              and platform independent and that is the major advantage we expect 
              to take from it.</p>
            <p>Of course, there is the effort of making the scripts. But importantly 
              this effort is to be taken by us now, to enable each museum, in 
              the future, to work with our minimal support.</p>
            <h3><a name="SECTION00033000000000000000"></a>Tools: Search, thesaurus 
              and encyclopedia.</h3>
            <p>In fact, our interest in SGML has to do with document reasoning. 
              And the reasoning carried out is to provide the information requested 
              by sophisticated users, who are not interested in quantity. Answers 
              "in quantity" can easily be obtained through several blind automatic 
              keyword indexing engines (some more blind than others). Even these 
              search engines are trying to be more adequate for users not so impressed 
              with "more is better" and their sophisticated technology, but really 
              searching for specific things.</p>
            <p>The main goal of this section is to show how to profit from the 
              structure of the SGML annotated information in order to see it as 
              a knowledge data base capable of inference. We will also show how 
              to exploit meta information in the process of building new documents 
              (ex. html pages), and building new tools (ex. browsers, search engines).</p>
            <p>The definition of the DTD and the tagging process, associates a 
              type to each element tagged. The element tag (and sometimes the 
              attributes) indicate the type of the information.</p>
            <p>In order to build a knowledge database with the different sorts 
              of information, a classification structure is necessary. In our 
              case a thesaurus will be created.</p>
            <h4><a name="SECTION00033100000000000000"></a>Building a Thesaurus</h4>
            <p>In order to establish relations between the different kind of objects. 
              The thesaurus will:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>establish relations of equality and normalization (alternate 
                or UseFor terms) 
              <li>define relations of being a particular case of (isa relation) 
              <li>define some properties related to a term 
              <li>establish other relations between terms (writers write books, 
                etc.) 
            </ul>
            <p>The thesaurus is a important tool to define relations over heterogeneous 
              sources of information participating in the GEIRA project (museums, 
              etc. ) and it is a way to reconcile different classification strategies.</p>
            <p>A browser and search engine over this heterogeneous information, 
              with some conceptual structure, will work like an "encyclopedia".</p>
            <h4><a name="SECTION00033200000000000000"></a>Building an Encyclopedia</h4>
            <p>In this context an "encyclopedia" should be defined as a view over 
              the information, and also as a navigation tool. </p>
            <p>The encyclopedia contains terms and associated information, which 
              can be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>types and their relations (from the thesaurus) 
              <li>instances and associations to the provider, information sources, 
                pointers to the document source, the context in which the term 
                appeared. (Typically, many instances for each specie) 
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="SECTION00040000000000000000"></a>Conclusions and Future 
              Work</h2>
            <p>The adoption of SGML by the people entering data was a easy step, 
              as good editors that give the authors promptly feedback, in a WYSIWYG 
              environment are available. These editors made entering SGML documents 
              as easy as entering any other unstructured document, but with the 
              benefit of constructing a structured document. In our study, the 
              archaeologists do prefer to enter SGML documents, instead of unstructured 
              descriptions, because they prefer some assistance to ensure structural 
              and some content validation. </p>
            <p>The SGML approach, for some daily data management, is not as adequate 
              as the relation database. This is because there is already a rich 
              set of sophisticated tools available to implement the applications 
              relying on the underlying data model. These tools have been incrementally 
              developed in the last decades.</p>
            <p>The relational database model, however, does not adapt well when 
              we try to use it for less structured data, with textual characteristics, 
              and with the notion of sequence. This kind of data is frequent in 
              object's descriptions, in discussions of their importance, in the 
              context where the objects were made or discovered, in biographies 
              and so on. If the data are less structured, how can it be incorporated 
              in a fixed structure? If there are many variants, the relational 
              model also tends to grow in the number of fields, many of which 
              will be null in a particular instance. In textual description, we 
              read a clear sequence of words containing meaning. Putting discrete 
              elements in a database, we loose the sequence of the elements. Due 
              to this limitation of the relational model (mainly when managing 
              less structured data), we usually create memo fields big enough 
              to store the textual descriptions. All the information can be stored 
              in memo fields, but the only thing to do with it is to store and 
              retrieve all the field as a block.</p>
            <p>The SGML standard is suitable for documents with less formal structure, 
              enabling further processing and reasoning. It is possible to manipulate 
              parts of the data, to build relations between parts of each, etc. 
              The drawback of this model is that this processing and reasoning 
              does not come without a price, in the sense that this processing 
              must be programmed. There are sophisticated tools to process SGML 
              documents, but these are very expensive, and require some practice 
              to get useful results. SGML has also advantages over the relational 
              model in the preliminary stage of data manipulation, when a structure 
              is not yet clearly defined. We can only start to work on the relational 
              model, after that model is built. The SGML approach accepts an incremental 
              refinement.</p>
            <h3><a name="SECTION00041000000000000000"></a>Future Work </h3>
            <p>In this stage, we need to evaluate and test as many tools and systems 
              as we can for SGML processing. We are also considering the possibility 
              of using just XML, as it seems to be powerful enough for our purposes, 
              without some of the difficulties of SGML which is a more general 
              standard. It seems that XML is being well accepted in the community.</p>
            <p>From a more scientific point of view, our work in the short term 
              is the investigation of the combination between the relational database 
              model with SGML. In this kind of architecture, we would have the 
              usual fields of the relational tables, but some of them containing 
              annotated data. To take advantage of the annotations, some improvements 
              must be made in the relational engine, enabling processing of the 
              fields containing SGML, according to the respective DTD, or even 
              without a DTD.</p>
