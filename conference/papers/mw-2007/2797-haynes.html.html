				  <p class="abstractText">As
				      the capabilities, social attitudes and requirements of Web site visitors
				      change, so must our approach to analysing their use of on-line museum
				      resources. We can no longer rely on rudimentary page view statistics
				      to gauge success and failure, but instead must devise new methods for
				      measuring and assessing the actual behaviour of museum Web site visitors.</p>
				  <p class="abstractText">In
				      this paper, we use detailed visitor click-data from five
				    leading museum Web sites to present and discuss generic patterns of user
				    behaviour. A typical 'profile' of a museum Web site visitor is also constructed

				  <h1>Introduction </h1>
				  <p>Almost immediately after the introduction of the first
				    Web browser in 1993, organisations and private individuals started to
				    collect and analyse data on how their visitors used their Web sites.
				    As the Web became an increasingly important medium for business in the
				    years that followed, Web analytics evolved from simple page counters,
				    through graphical reports, to intelligent prediction engines.</p>
				  <p>In recent years, we have witnessed a turning point
				    for Web analytics. Changes in technology and social behaviour on the
				    Web have reduced the relevance of standard Web statistics. With the growing
				    popularity of AJAX (updating Web pages without a page refresh), user-generated
				    content and RSS (distributed content), the basis of page views and Web
				    site sessions for Key Performance Indicators (as used by the UK government
				    for Museums, for example) is becoming increasingly problematic.</p>
				  <p>As the difficulty of measuring quantity of content
				    consumption increases, and the measure of success on such metrics decreases,
				    attention is being re-focused on the higher level issues of usability,
				    accessibility and information architecture. Paradoxically, improvements
				    to usability and information architecture often further reduce the measurements
				    originally used for success, with a typical reduction in page views and
				    session times as users are better able to find the information they seek. </p>
				  <p>Usability, however, is notoriously difficult to measure;
				    focus groups and visitor surveys are often employed to estimate some
				    quantifiable measurements of ease-of-use. Collecting similar data <em>automatically</em> on
				    Web sites is an even tougher proposition, although some important measures
				    of usability can be deduced through the analysis of how users behave
				    on the site: what, where and when they click.</p>
				  <h1>Measuring and Analysing
				      Visitor Behaviour</h1>
				  <p>For this research, we used clickdensity (<a href="../http://www.clickdensity.com/" target="_blank">http://www.clickdensity.com</a>),
				    an on-line tool that can be used to study user behavioural data, to analyse
				    a number of museum Web sites. Together with standard Web analytics data
				    (date-time, browser, platform, screen resolution, etc.), clickdensity
				    collects specific on-line 'behaviour' data such as the exact X/Y co-ordinate
				    of every mouse click on a Web site and the time elapsed between each
				    click. This information can be presented in a variety of forms, including
				    heat maps showing hot spots on a page. Armed with this information, we
				    can begin to analyse the trends and patterns of visitor behaviour, and
				    hence usability.</p>
				  <p>The following museums kindly participated in data
				    collection for this study: the Imperial War Museum (<a href="../http://www.iwm.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.iwm.org.uk</a>),
				    Museum of London (<a href="../http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk</a>), Powerhouse Museum
				    (<a href="../http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/" target="_blank">http://www.powerhousemuseum.com</a>), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art
				    (<a href="../http://www.sfmoma.org/" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org</a>) and the Science Museum (<a href="../http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk</a>). </p>
				  <p>The data presented in this research is taken from
				    the week of Saturday 20th to Friday 26th January 2007. During this seven-day
				    period, 300,654 clicks were recorded from 104,524 user sessions across
				    selected pages from the five museums. </p>
				  <h1>Who Are The Visitors?
				      What Do They 'Look' Like?</h1>
				  <p>Before analysing visitor behaviour on the museum Web
				    sites, we can construct an <em>average</em> <em>profile</em> of
				    a museum Web site visitor, and compare this to the typical profile of
				    a non-museum Web site visitor. For comparison purposes, we have selected
				    2000 non-museum Web sites (hereafter 'Standard' Web sites), which over
				    the same date-range produced 4,886,281 clicks from 3,601,086 sessions.
				    These Standard Web sites cater to a varied audience, from financial Web
				    sites to national newspapers, supermarket chains to high-street retailers,
				    global travel agencies to long-tail niche sites (such as one supplying
				    toupees for babies).</p>
				  <p>Comparing the platform and browser combination of
				    Museum sites and Standard Web sites (Figure 1), we find that nearly twice
				    as many Museum visitors use Firefox on a PC (10.4% of users, for both
				    versions) as Standard visitors (6.4% of users).</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="haynes-figure_1.gif" alt="Fig 1: Platform and Browser make-up of the Museum and Standard Web site groups" width="487" height="333" border="0" /></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      1: Platform and Browser make-up of the Museum and Standard Web site
				      groups</p>
				  <p>Similarly, the Museum visitor is five times as likely
				    to be a Mac user (9.2%) than a Standard visitor (1.8%), and of the Mac
				    users, five times as many use Safari (7.8%) than Firefox (1.4%). Although
				    Museum and Standard Web sites share similar percentages of PC/Internet
				    Explorer visitors at versions 5.5 and 6, far fewer Museum visitors are
				    using version 7 (22.1%) than Standard visitors (36.9%).</p>
				  <p>The differences in screen resolutions (Figure 2) are
				    negligible, with the small differences largely attributable to the number
				    of Mac users in each group.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="haynes-figure_2.gif" alt="Fig 2: Screen Resolutions of Museum and Standard Web site visitors" width="514" height="331" border="0" /> </p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      2: Screen Resolutions of Museum and Standard Web site visitors</p>
				  <p>Examining how the visits break down by day of the
				    week (Figure 3), we find that the typical distribution curve (busy mid-week,
				    quiet at weekends) is indeed followed by Museum Web sites, but with a
				    flatter curve than Standard. The mid-week museum peak accounts for 19%
				    of visitors - compared to 22.5% of Standard visitors - and museum Web
				    sites attract twice as many visitors at the weekend than Standard Web
				    sites, in terms of their percentage of visits.</p>

				  <p class="caption">Fig
				    3: Percentage of visits per day of week, of Museum and Standard Web site
				    visitors</p>
				  <h1>What Are The Visitors
				      Doing?</h1>
				  <p>The most clicked-on area of a museum home page is
				    the <em>Visiting/Opening Times</em> section
				    (an average of 17% of all museum home page visitors click on these links),
				    so we will first turn our attention to this section. These links also
				    tend to be those that are clicked the quickest (i.e. the least time between
				    the page loading and the user clicking on a link); this could be due
				    to a combination of the visitors knowing exactly what they are looking
				    for, and the prominent positioning of such links on the page.</p>
				  <h2>How Visitors use the
				      Visiting section on Museum Web sites</h2>
				  <p>Predictably, maps are the busiest areas of Visiting
				    sections. On average, 28.5% of all clicks in these sections occur on
				    links to maps, with this figure increasing to just over 50% for sites
				    with a choice of detailed map links. However, even on sites that provide
				    a range of map options, our click analysis shows that a significant number
				    of visitors still <em>copy and paste</em> postal
				    codes and street addresses from museum address text on the page.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="haynes-figure_4.jpg" alt="Fig 4: Evidence of users clicking either side of addresses, to copy and paste" width="485" height="153" /></p>
  				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      4: Evidence of users clicking either side of addresses, to copy and
				      paste</p>
				  <p>The reasons for visitors copying and pasting addresses
				    and postal codes is unclear; they could be more comfortable with a specific
				    mapping tool than the one provided, or perhaps they need directions from
				    a greater distance than existing directions provide, or perhaps they
				    are searching for hotels in the area. In reality, it is likely to be
				    a combination of these, and much more. As it is unlikely that a museum
				    will be able to satisfy all of these requirements with additional hyperlinks
				    and information, it is recommended that the museum address (including
				    postal/zip code) always be made available on these pages.</p>
				  <p>Even though it might not be possible to satisfy all
				    of the diverse mapping requirements of visitors, museum <em>Visiting</em> sections
				    generally do seem to satisfy most questions regarding visitor information;
				    on average, only 0.7% of clicks from this section are made in the search
				    box (compared with an average of 4.8% of home page visitors who use the
				    search facility, or 3.4% of <em>Exhibitions</em> page
				    visitors).</p>
				  <p>Once a user has obtained their information about locating
				    and travelling to the museum, the next most popular links are for <em>Exhibitions</em>, <em>Galleries</em> and <em>Events</em>;
				    i.e. &ldquo;I know how to get there, now tell me what I can see and do&rdquo;.
				    It is <em>Events Calendars </em>that
				    we shall turn our attention to next.</p>
				  <h2>How Visitors use Events
				      Calendars on Museum Web sites</h2>
				  <p>An events calendar is a common way of allowing users
				    to view the activities for a particular day. The research data shows
				    some clear trends in user behaviour when using the calendar.</p>
				  <p>The calendars offer consistent functionality across
				    sites:</p>
				  <ul style="margin-top:0in;" type="square">
                    <li>The ability to view the next month&rsquo;s
                      events</li>
				    <li>The ability to view the previous month&rsquo;s
				      events</li>
				    <li>The ability to click on a date (from the current
				      month) to see that date's events</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>The data for this research was collected from the
				    latter part of January. It is therefore unsurprising that there are a
				    large number of clicks to browse the next month (February), with very
				    little use of the previous month (December). </p>
					  <p class="caption"><img src="haynes-figure_5.jpg" alt="Fig 5: Visitors check for events in upcoming months, but not previous months" width="149" height="93" /> </p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      5: Visitors check for events in upcoming months, but not previous months</p>
				  <h3>Weekend Visitor Behaviour</h3>
				  <p>At the weekend, visitors tend to use the calendar
				    to view the current weekend&rsquo;s events.  </p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="haynes-figure_6.gif" alt="&nbsp;Fig 6: A calendar heat map for Saturday 20 January, showing that most weekend visitors are interested in the current weekend, rather than planning ahead" width="181" height="33" /> </p>
				  				  <p class="caption">&nbsp;Fig
				      6: A calendar heat map for Saturday 20 January, showing that most weekend
				      visitors are interested in the current weekend, rather than planning
				      ahead </p>
				  <p>On a Monday and Tuesday, users view the events for
				    the coming week almost equally. </p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="haynes-figure_7.gif" alt="Fig 7: A calendar heat map for Tuesday 23 January, with clicks spread evenly over the week ahead" width="177" height="18" /> </p>
				  				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      7: A calendar heat map for Tuesday 23 January, with clicks spread evenly
				      over the week ahead</p>
				  <p>As the weekend approaches (from Wednesday onwards),
				    the clicks on the weekend dates (Saturday in particular) start to increase.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="haynes-figure_8.gif" alt="Fig 8: A calendar heat map for Wednesday 24 January, with increasing clicks for the coming weekend&nbsp;&nbsp; " width="143" height="26" /> </p>
				  				  <p class="caption" align="left" style="text-align:left;">Fig
				      8: A calendar heat map for Wednesday 24<sup> </sup>January, with increasing
				      clicks for the coming weekend&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
				  <p>In summary, the heat maps appear to show that during
				    the week visitors use the Web site to plan&nbsp; for future visits, but
				    at the weekend they are more concerned with imminent visits (for the
				    same weekend). This could imply that there are two types of user: the
				    organised forward thinker, and the more spontaneous (weekend?) visitors.</p>
				  <h2>The Home Page</h2>
				  <p>Usability best practice recommends that Web sites
				    include a link to their home page as part of the core template - a guideline
				    that was followed by all of the museum Web sites in our sample. This,
				    however, presented an interesting usability issue of its own. Whilst
				    analysing the <em>click behaviour over time</em> for
				    the homepages in the data sample, we noticed that during the first 5
				    seconds on the page a significant proportion (up to 14%) of users clicked
				    the 'home' link (Figure 9). This would have the effect of reloading the
				    current page and causing possible confusion or annoyance to the users.</p>
				  <p>We also noticed that sites with a more graphical home
				    page (less &ldquo;text-heavy&rdquo;) seemed to suffer less from this
				    problem than those sites that offered little distinction between their
				    homepage and subsequent &lsquo;content level&rsquo; pages. This effect
				    could therefore possibly be caused by users coming to the home page of
				    the site through a search result (or other external link), and not realising
				    their location within the site structure, clicking the &lsquo;home&rsquo; link
				    to request the main page. If this is the case, a more structured, holistically
				    designed home page could reduce this statistic.</p>
				  <h3>Searching from the Home Page</h3>
				  <p>Apart from the home page link, the other home page
				    element that receives increased usage in the first five seconds is the
				    search facility (Figure 9). On average, 10% of the users who click within
				    the first second of arriving on the home page will carry out a search.
				    This falls to approximately half this value for the users who take longer
				    than a second to act.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><a href="haynes-figure_9.gif" target="_blank"><img src="haynes-figure_9.gif" alt="Fig 2: Screen Resolutions of Museum and Standard Web site visitors" width="498" height="298" border="0" /></a> </p>
				  				  <p class="caption">Fig 9: How visitors use various home page elements
				    over time</p>
				  <p>During the first five seconds (when the search is
				    used most heavily), it is unlikely that the visitor has had the opportunity
				    to scan the entire home page for the information required. It is therefore
				    more likely that this direct route to the search facility is not caused
				    by poor information architecture or prioritisation of information on
				    the page. Rather, it may be that Web users are extremely comfortable
				    with the process of &lsquo;keyword searching&rsquo; (rather than browsing)
				    for information (for example, because of their high success rate when
				    using Google), so they therefore choose this method immediately. Search
				    boxes also tend to be highly visible, recognisable, and positioned in
				    predictable locations (top right, or to the left), allowing these &lsquo;power
				    users&rsquo; to identify their preferred route quickly (i.e. within the
				    first five seconds).</p>
				  <h3>How Long Before They Click?</h3>
				  <p>If we no longer look at clicks on specific elements,
				    but rather the average times when visitors click on the home page (irrespective
				    of what was clicked on), we find the distribution curve in Figure 10. </p>
				  <p class="caption"><a href="haynes-figure_10.gif" target="_blank"><img src="haynes-figure_10_400.gif" alt="Fig 10: Distribution of when users click on the home page" width="400" height="218" border="0" /></a> </p>
				  				  <p class="caption" style="text-indent:35.45pt;">Fig 10: Distribution
				        of when users click on the home page </p>
				  <p>This curve shows a peak (of visitors clicking) at
				    about 2-3 seconds after page load, with a &lsquo;long tail&rsquo; that
				    eventually extends to many hundreds of seconds. Although the four museums
				    plotted exhibit a similar shape, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the two
				    museums with the smallest initial peak and tallest tail (museums 2 and
				    4) &ndash; that is, the museums where users tend to not click as quickly
				    on the home page &ndash; are the museums with the least text and most
				    graphics (i.e. the more &lsquo;design-led&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;content-led&rsquo; home
				    pages). Common wisdom would seem to suggest that visitors would spend
				    more time on content-heavy home pages, which tend to have many options
				    (and therefore require longer to read), but this evidence suggests otherwise.
				    Perhaps visitors can find their required information faster on content-heavy
				    pages, or perhaps visitors spend longer admiring the imagery on &lsquo;design-led&rsquo; home
				    pages before clicking?</p>
				  <h3 style="page-break-after:auto;">Generic Behaviour</h3>
				  <p>In addition to the above, we can also present a number
				    of generic patterns of user behaviour detected across the (museum) sites.</p>
				  <p>Possibly as a consequence of Fitts&rsquo; Law (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts'_law)
				    and the shape of computer mouse pointers, visitors tend to click in the
				    horizontal centre of links, slightly towards the bottom of links, towards
				    the bottom-right of buttons, and in the left of empty text boxes (Figure
				    11).</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="haynes-figure_11.jpg" alt="Fig 11: Where visitors click on links, text boxes and buttons" width="456" height="157" /> </p>
				  				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      11: Where visitors click on links, text boxes and buttons</p>
				  <p>With regards to the type of object that visitors click
				    on, approximately 90% of all clicks are on hyperlinked elements (text,
				    images, etc.), 9.5% are on form fields (text boxes, drop-down boxes,
				    etc.), about 0.3% are on multimedia objects (including embedded Flash),
				    and the remaining 0.2% are on non-hyperlinked areas (plain text, background,
				    headings, etc.). This is in stark contrast to our previous research (http://www.clickdensity.com/viewpost.aspx?PostID=46),
				    which found (from about 2000 non-museum Web sites) that only about 60%
				    of clicks were on hyperlinks, about 35% were on form fields, nearly 3%
				    were on multimedia, and just over 1% on non-hyperlinked areas (Figure
				    12).</p>
					<p class="caption"><img src="haynes-figure_12.gif" alt="Fig 12: What users click on, for museum and standard sites" width="485" height="357" /> </p>
				  <p class="caption"> Fig
				      12: What users click on, for museum and standard sites</p>
				  <p>This contrast is almost certainly because museum Web
				    sites are more &lsquo;content-rich&rsquo; than the average Web site,
				    with deeper and more frequent hyperlinks.</p>
				  <h2 style="page-break-after:auto;">Summary and Conclusions</h2>
				  <p>By measuring and analysing new types of data, such
				    as &lsquo;click time&rsquo; and &lsquo;click coordinates&rsquo;, we are
				    able to better construct assumptions about user behaviour on museum Web
				    sites. This data was collected for five leading museum Web sites and
				    analysed for generic patterns of user behaviour.</p>
				  <p>We found a distinct difference between museum and &lsquo;Standard&rsquo; Web
				    site visitors, noticeably in museum sites&rsquo; increased use of Macs
				    and PC/Firefox. We also found that museum Web sites attract a larger
				    percentage of their audience at weekends (compared to Standard Web sites),
				    and also have a much higher percentage of clicks on &lsquo;hyperlinks&rsquo; than
				    Standard Web sites.</p>
				  <p>The <em>Visiting</em> sections
				      are undoubtedly the most popular sections of museum Web sites, and
				      although maps are the most commonly requested link within these sections,
				      a large number of users still <em>copy and paste</em> the
				      museum address for their own mapping purposes.</p>
				  <p>Within <em>Events Calendars</em>,
				      we found two distinct modes of use: visitors during the week were interested
				      fairly equally in the next seven days, whereas weekend visitors were
				      primarily interested only in the current weekend.</p>
				  <p>Graphical home pages were found to be potentially
				    less confusing for referred visitors, with fewer clicks on the &lsquo;home&rsquo; link,
				    but users also tended to wait slightly longer on these graphical home
				    pages before making a decision to click.</p>
				  <p>In conclusion, analysing the use of museum Web sites
				    - and importantly the <em>reasons</em> for
				    such use - is a necessary but complicated process. This type of analysis
				    provides a fascinating insight into such user behaviour. As with all
