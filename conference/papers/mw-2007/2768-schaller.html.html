				  target audience segments based on demographic groups. However, we all know
				  that people vary in other ways; one size does not fit all. This paper

				  age, and gender) on user preferences for computer-based educational activities. </p>
				<p class="abstract">Using David Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory (Kolb,

				  design. Building on prior work presented at Museums &amp; the Web (Schaller
				  et al., 2002, 2005), we found that learning style <em>does</em> influence
				  an individual's preferences for learning activities, particularly among
				  adults. For example, adult social learners prefer role-play activities
				  while intellectual learners prefer reference-style presentations. </p>
				<p class="abstract">The relationship between learning styles and these preferences
				  is stronger in adults, with adults showing more learning style-based preferences.
				  On the other hand, among children ages 10-13 (middle school), the perceived

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p >One of the long-standing challenges in creating informal learning experiences
        for the Web is how developers can visualize their remote, often anonymous
        audiences. Because many Web users surf as individuals, it is helpful to look
        for ways to understand their diversity and uniqueness. We have become increasingly
        convinced that in order to create more engaging and effective learning experiences
        for all types of learners, Web developers must deepen their understanding
        of the ways that factors such as learning style, age, and gender influence
        user preferences for particular types of interactive digital learning activities.
        Evaluation methods and analysis of the effectiveness of specific informal
        on-line learning sites have continued to mature (Bearman and Trant 2004).
        As insightful as these studies are, drawing generalizations from them is
        quite difficult, and there has been less specific research into broader patterns
        of user preferences. This study is therefore an effort to approach the issue
        as a research question, rather than an evaluation problem.</p>
      <p >This research study is the result of collaboration between two educational
        Web developers (Schaller and Allison-Bunnell) and two museum researchers
        (Borun and Chambers). It explores the role of learning style, along with
        age and gender, in shaping the user experience of Web-based informal learning
        materials. We hypothesized that when the learning experience fits an individual's
        dominant learning style, the experience will be more engaging and more satisfying,
        and thus a more successful, informal learning experience. </p>
      <h3>Learning Styles</h3>
      <p >There has been little research into the role of individual preferences
        or learning styles in the effectiveness of computer-based informal education.
        The task is confounded by the many different models of learning style that
        have been proposed. The models do not describe the same aspect of this complex
        and not easily reduced phenomenon; they focus variously on information acquisition,
        processing, storage, retrieval, or application. While learning style models
        have become unfashionable in academic circles, they are commonly applied
        in public education and corporate settings as a framework to recognize and
        accommodate individual differences.</p>
      <p >Our research employs David Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) (1984),
        which fits well with our pre-existing typology of educational Web activities
        (Schaller et al. 2002). Kolb draws on research by Dewey and Piaget, among
        others, to identify two major dimensions of learning: perception and processing.
        The dimensions are visualized as two intersecting axes (see Figure 1). Each
        axis has two poles: <em>perception</em> ranges from concrete experience to
        abstract conceptualization, and <em>processing</em> ranges from active experimentation
        to reflective observation. The two axes form a four-quadrant field for mapping
        individual learning styles. Researchers have applied various labels to each
        of the styles represented by Kolb's quadrants. We will use our preferred
        labels in place of Kolb's labels (in parentheses) as follows: Social (Accommodating),
        Creative (Diverging), Intellectual (Assimilating), and Practical (Converging).</p>
      <p align="left" class="caption" ><img src="schaller-fig1.gif" alt="Fig 1: Learning Styles defined by Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory" width="400" height="324" /></p>
      <p class="caption" >Fig 1: Learning Styles defined by Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory</p>
      <p >The intersection of the processing and perception dimensions creates a
        set of learning styles, members of which are both distinct and related to
        adjacent styles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Social
          learners are leaders.</strong> They learn best by tackling a problem as
          a group, relying on their own intuition and information from other people
          rather than books and lectures. They seek out new experiences, often take
        risks, and employ hands-on methods to accomplish their goals.</li>
    <li> <strong>Creative
      learners are imaginative.</strong> They bring an open mind to new ideas
      and seek out multiple points of view. They enjoy brainstorming with a group,
      though they often will listen and observe before sharing their own ideas.
      They rely on concrete examples to learn, and trust their own hunches and
      feelings when making decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Intellectual
      learners are organized, logical, and precise.</strong> They like to learn
      from lectures, reading, and contemplation. They find facts, ideas, and
      information fascinating and preferable to people and emotions. More scientific
      than artistic, they often like to conduct experiments, but can find it
      hard to make decisions or to take action on a matter.</li>
    <li> <strong>Practical
      learners are both thinkers and doers.</strong> They learn through experimentation,
      seeking out new ideas and finding practical applications for them. They
      can focus intently on a few subjects, preferring technical challenges to
      interpersonal matters. They are goal-oriented and make decisions easily.</li>
	    </ul>
      <p >We find this characterization of learning styles valuable because, rather
        than being an internal mental model of cognition, it emphasizes how people
        like to interact with content. Kolb's characterization of the modalities
        of engagement can therefore guide developers in shaping an activity's structure
        to support these modalities.</p>
      <h2>Research Study</h2>
      <p >This research study, funded by the National Science Foundation, explores
        the relationship between learning style and on-line interactives. Adapting
        an on-line activity typology developed for an earlier study (Schaller et
        al. 2002), we hypothesized that users will prefer an activity that matches
        their dominant learning style over one that does not. Table 1 summarizes
        our hypothesized correlations between activity type and learning style.</p>

      <p class="caption" >Table 1: Hypothesized activity type preferences by Learning Style</p>
      <p >We also hypothesized that if an activity type aligned well with a user's
        learning style, the user would perceive that activity to be more like play
        than work, whereas activities that did not easily align with learning style
        would be perceived to be more like work.</p>
      <p >Our research focused on children age 10-13 (hereafter referred to as &quot;children&quot;),
        but we gathered data from all ages, allowing us to test our hypotheses with
        both children and adults.</p>
      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p >Kolb's 12-question <em>Learning Style Inventory</em> (LSI) has been validated
        for high school-age youth (ages 14-18) and adults (Kolb et al., 2000). Our
        first step was to modify the LSI for use by our target audience of children
        age 10-13. We changed eight words to simpler terms. We then deployed an on-line
        survey consisting of the modified LSI plus age and gender questions. Figure
        2 shows a sample question from the Flash-based survey, which was designed
        to be more fun and interactive than Kolb's paper-based LSI in order to appeal
        to our younger audience. We used the results of this survey to create a normalized
        distribution of learning styles for children, such that each learning style
        was represented by 25% of the sample.</p>
      <p class="caption" ><img src="schaller-fig2.gif" alt="Fig 2: Survey question from Learning Style Inventory for children" width="400" height="295" /></p>
      <p class="caption" >Fig 2: Survey question from Learning Style Inventory for children</p>
      <p >We also piloted a two-sentence description of each activity type, refining
        each for maximal understanding by middle school students. We then ran a preliminary
        on-line survey that asked respondents to rank order their three preferred
        activity types based on our written descriptions of the activities and to
        take the LSI. Figure 3 shows how respondents were asked to rank order their
        top three activity types.</p>
      <p >This survey was placed on several eduweb sites and linked from 11 additional
        museum sites. The survey ran from June to October 2005 and collected a sample
        of 3013 respondents: 1226 middle-school-aged, 545 high school, and 1242 adults.
        Applying the normalized distribution to these data, we found significant
        correlations between learning style and activity preference. Individuals
        whose scores fell on an axis between style quadrants were eliminated.</p>
      <p class="caption" ><img src="schaller-fig3.jpg" alt="Fig 3: Activity Type ranking question in survey" width="400" height="291" /></p>
      <p class="caption" >Fig 3: Activity Type ranking question in survey</p>
      <p >In the next phase of research, five of eduweb's existing educational activities,
        all dealing with the topic of animal ecology, were selected, abridged, and
        modified to provide brief (3-4 minute) experiences that exemplified five
        of the six activity types: Design, Role-Play, Puzzle-Mystery, Simulation,
        and Interactive Reference. The sixth type, Discussion, was omitted since
        it did not lend itself to one-way interaction and proved least popular in
        the preliminary survey. Figure 4 shows a sample screen of the Design activity.</p>
      <p >A laboratory-style face-to-face study of 154 children (age 10-13) was
        conducted with groups visiting The Franklin Institute Science Museum
        and at a nearby school (Friends Select School). The study consisted of
        the activity type rank ordering and the LSI (as in the on-line survey),
        followed by the sample activities (presented in randomized sequence)
        and a Likert scale rating for each one. Interviewers asked all the children
        to discuss their ratings and to explain what they liked and did not like.
        In addition, children placed each activity on a 5-point bipolar scale
        (semantic differential) from play to work. Results of the laboratory
        study gave us insight into the aspects of the activities that appealed
        to individuals with each of the learning styles. The laboratory study
        also gave us interesting illustrative quotes from children.</p>

      <p class="caption" >Fig 4: Sample Design activity survey item</p>
      <p >A second on-line survey, also linked from multiple eduweb and museum sites
        around the country, was conducted from May to November 2006 and produced
        a sample consisting of 1161 middle-school aged children, 376 high school
        aged children, and 1056 adults. This survey was similar to the lab study,
        but since subjects did not necessarily complete all five of the sample activities,
        they were not asked to rank order the activities, and were scored only for
        the activities they did complete. T-tests and X<sup>2</sup> tests determined
        that there were no significant differences in the populations by number of
        activities completed. The raw sample (with the exception of subjects who
        scored 0 on either axis) was used to calculate frequencies of learning styles
        in the population. All other tests for correlation used the normalized distribution.
        Results of this on-line survey are reported below.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <h3>Distribution of Learning Styles</h3>
      <p >There is a marked variation in the distribution of learning styles among
        children aged 10-13,  in comparison to adults. Over two-thirds of all children
        are Active learners with a Practical or Social learning style. In comparison,
        the majority of adults are Abstract learners exhibiting Intellectual or Practical
        learning styles. Kolb's research on teens and adults shows a similar shift
        towards abstraction as people get older (Kolb 2005). It is interesting that
        the Practical learning style, at the intersection of Active and Abstract,
        is the most common style for both children and adults.</p>
      <p class="caption" ><img src="schaller-fig5.gif" alt="Fig 5: Learning Style distributions for children and adults." width="400" height="296" /></p>
      <p class="caption" >Fig 5: Learning Style distributions for children and adults.</p>
      <p >Comparing age groups, children are more likely to have a Social learning
        style, while adults are more likely to have an Intellectual style (Figure
        5). This pattern reflects the shift toward Abstract and Reflective modes
        as people mature.</p>
      <p >With respect to gender and learning style, we found no difference between
        boys and girls. Among adults, on the other hand, more adult females had a
        Social learning style in comparison to adult males. </p>
      <h3>Age, Gender, and Activity Preference</h3>
      <p >Based on responses to our brief written descriptions (not the sample activities
        themselves), there is significant variation in activity preference by age
        group (Figure 6). Children prefer Role-Play (30%) and Design (29%) activities
        over the other activities. Adults prefer Interactive Reference (33%) and
        Puzzle-Mystery (24%). </p>
      <p class="caption" ><img src="schaller-fig6.gif" alt="Fig 6: Activity type preference for children and adults" width="400" height="261" /></p>
      <p class="caption" >Fig 6: Activity type preference for children and adults</p>
      <p >Gender also plays a role. Among children aged 10-13, boys prefer Role-Play
        significantly more than girls do, while girls prefer Design more than boys
        do. These differences affect the average ranking of the two activities: Role-Play
        and Design were ranked first and second by boys, and vice versa by girls.
        However, these gender differences are secondary to the influence of age.
        When considering children and adults together, gender no longer predicts
        activity preference. Girls are more like boys of their age, in that both
        prefer Design and Role-Play, than they are like adult women, who, like adult
        men, prefer Interactive Reference and Puzzle-Mystery. Therefore age remains
        the dominant factor in determining activity preference.</p>
      <p >Note that these relationships are statistically significant <em>in that
      they differ from what would be expected in the sample using X<sup>2</sup>, </em>but
      the relationships are relative to other groups and should not be equated
      with popularity. For example, girls preferred Discussion more than did
      boys, but Discussion is the least popular of the six activity types. Only
      6% of children and 3% of adults chose Discussion as their favorite activity. Each
      activity has a degree of appeal for a given audience. Chi squares compare
      various categories of user (e.g. child/adult, male/female, and the four
      learning styles), whereas Figure 6 shows <em>frequencies</em> of preferences
      within the population.</p>
      <h3>Learning Style and Activity Preference</h3>
      <p >There are significant relationships between learning style and preferences
        for on-line educational activities.</p>
      <h4>Children</h4>
      <p >Figure 7 shows the following relationships between learning style and activity
        preference among children:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Social learners prefer Discussion more than those with other learning styles.
          Social learners rely on other people when gathering information and accomplishing
          goals, making Discussion activities an ideal medium. As one Social girl
          put it, <em>&quot;Because I can ask other people for help and compare answers,
        and it would make learning more fun!&quot;</em></li>
    <li>Intellectual
      learners prefer Interactive Reference more than those with other learning
      styles. A hypermedia encyclopedia allows for exploration of a wide range
      of information, particularly abstract ideas and concepts. As one Intellectual
      child said, <em>&quot;It's easy for me to observe on my own. Reading or looking
        at something is easy for me.&quot;</em></li>
	    </ul>
      <p class="caption" ><img src="schaller-fig7.gif" alt="Figure 7: Children's preferred activity type mapped to learning style" width="400" height="308" /></p>
      <p class="caption" >Figure 7: Children's preferred activity type mapped to learning
        style</p>
      <p >These two associations support our research hypotheses. However, there
        were no significant associations for Creative or Practical learners within
        our target age group (10-13).</p>
      <h4>Adults</h4>
      <p >The relationship between learning style and activity preference is stronger
        in the adult age group. Among adults, all four learning styles are associated
        with activity preferences. Figure 8 shows the following relationships between
        learning style and activity type preference among adults:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Creative learners prefer Discussion more than those with other learning
          styles.Like Social learners, Creative learners learn best from concrete experiences,
          such as interacting with other people. Creative learners also seek out new
          ideas and perspectives from others. As one Creative adult said, <em>&quot;It
        gives me new ideas ... I get to meet new people and learn through the interaction.&quot;</em></li>
   <li>
     Intellectual learners prefer Interactive Reference more than those with other
     learning styles. As with children, adult Intellectuals seek out direct
     contact with information, whether in print or on-line. <em>&quot;This has
       always been my favorite approach to learning. I read the entire Encyclopedia
       Britannica before I was 12 years old.&quot; &quot;I am in constant search
       for knowledge.&quot;</em></li>
   <li> Practical
     learners prefer Puzzle-Mystery more than those with other learning styles.
     This activity type puts abstract content into a real-world problem or mystery,
     appealing to Practical learners' desire to solve problems and find useful
     applications for ideas and theories. <em>&quot;It's fun to investigate things
       and determine solutions.&quot;</em></li>
    <li>
      Social learners prefer Role-Play more than those with other learning styles.
      Social learners rely on people for information, so an activity like role-play
      that embodies information in character voices is appealing. <em>&quot;I
        like playing outside my own character and exploring other personalities.&quot;</em> Social
      learners also prefer Design more than those with other learning styles.
      Design activities appeal to Social learners' desire for active, hands-on
      learning. &quot;Design is the ultimate problem-solving exercise.&quot;</li>
	    </ul>

      <p class="caption" >Figure 8: Adult's preferred activity type mapped to learning style.</p>
      <p >These results generally support our hypotheses. Three of our predictions
        are borne out:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Intellectual
        adults prefer Interactive Reference.</li>
    <li> Social
      adults prefer Role-Play.</li>
    <li>Practical
      adults prefer Puzzle-Mystery.</li>
	    </ul>
      <p >Two additional associations are close to our predictions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Social adults (rather than Creative, as we predicted) prefer Design activities.</li>
    <li> Creative
      adults (rather than Social, as we predicted) prefer Discussion.</li>
	    </ul>
      <p >Both Social and Creative are on the Concrete side of the Concrete-Abstract
        axis, but differ on the Active-Reflective axis. Both Design and Discussion
        involve active participation as well as reflective contemplation. Respondents
        appear to have reacted to different aspects of these two activity types than
        we predicted.</p>
      <h4>Sample Activity Rating and Play/Work Score</h4>
      <p >When testing the sample activities, children nearly always liked those
        activities that they scored as high in play value. That is, children gave
        high activity ratings to the same activities that they thought were more
        like play than work. Play value seems to be more influential than learning
        style in predicting children's responses to a given activity.</p>
      <p >Adults, however, <em>do</em> differentiate between the two ratings. On
        average, adults gave each activity a play/work score that was similar to
        that given by children. But their activity ratings did not follow suit. For
        example, adults scored Role-Play as second in play value, but last in activity
        rating &ndash; behind Simulation and Interactive Reference, which had lower play
        scores. Play, it seems, is a secondary consideration for adults, with Simulation
        and Interactive Reference offering something valuable to adults that overrides
        the appeal of play. </p>
      <p >In modifying activities for use in this research, we sought to emphasize
        the core attributes of each activity type, rather than to strengthen its
        play value. It would certainly be possible to design a simulation with high
        play value if that was a goal. A commercial game like <em>The Sims</em> is
        a good example of just such a thing.</p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p >While museums and informal learning institutions have embraced the Web
        as a medium for public outreach and education, we still are grappling to
        understand our on-line audiences in their rich diversity and individual uniqueness.
        This research identifies several important factors that developers should
        consider when creating computer-based learning materials. Our central hypothesis,
        that activity preference and learning style are related, has been confirmed
        for adults. This relationship is weaker for middle school-age children, presumably
        because their learning styles are not yet as fully solidified as adult's
        learning styles. We have also found that activity preferences differ significantly
        between groups of children and adults. Finally, gender differences in activity
        preferences are weaker than learning style or age. </p>
      <h3>Learning Style</h3>
      <p >Learning style is indeed a major determinant of adult activity preference.
        The adult preference for Interactive Reference supports our previous findings
        that many adults have instrumental information-seeking goals for their on-line
        activities (Schaller et al. 2004). Adults' preference for Puzzle-Mystery
        accords with the widespread popularity of puzzle-type
        &quot;casual games&quot; such as Bejeweled and Solitaire among adults on- and off-line.
        It remains an interesting challenge for informal education developers to
        create Puzzle-Mystery content for adults that contains both casual game puzzle-solving
        elements and real-world educational content.</p>
      <p >Children, on the other hand, do not have as strongly-differentiated learning
        styles, and the relationship between learning style and activity preference
        for children appears to be correspondingly less strong.</p>
      <h3>Age Group</h3>
      <p >While the data and statistical analysis employed for this paper do not
        allow us to tie activity preference or learning style to a particular age,
        it is clear that the relationship between learning style and activity preference
        is different in children and adults. Other factors besides learning style
        shape people&rsquo;s activity preferences. Children scored our sample Design and
        Role-Play activities as being most like play on the play/work continuum;
        they also gave these two activity types the highest overall ratings. Play
        value seems to be more important than learning style for children. </p>
      <h3>Gender </h3>
      <p >With regard to gender differences, there has been considerable discussion
        about designing girl-friendly video games and other electronic media (Chu
        et al. 2004). We found some influence of gender on children's activity preferences,
        with boys preferring Role-Play and girls preferring Design, However, these
        differences are not related to learning style, and they are secondary to
        age. To bridge gender differences, developers should consider ways to incorporate
        attributes from Role-Play and Design into any activity designed for children. </p>
      <h2>Implications and Applications</h2>
      <p >Our results for the adult sample suggest that diverse pedagogical methods
        are critical to successfully engaging the full spectrum of adult learners.
        In particular, it is vital for developers to recognize that their own learning
        style is just one of multiple ways to learn, and to consider designs for
        interactives that will appeal to other types of learners. For example, computer
        science students tend to be Intellectual learners (Kolb, 2005). Developers
        who are Intellectual learners would need to look beyond their own intuitive
        personal preferences to find ways to engage Social, Creative, and Practical
        learners. Two different solutions to this problem are possible. First, developers
        can create custom activities for each learning style, offering a suite of
        a la carte activities ranging from searchable reference content for Intellectual
        learners, puzzles or mystery activities for Practical learners, hands-on
        design interactives for Social learners, and an opportunity to share ideas
        and perspectives for Creative learners. Alternatively, developers can incorporate
        attributes that appeal to each of the learning styles into a single integrated
        activity. </p>
      <p >This research study informed eduweb's development of such a project, a
        Web site about black holes in collaboration with the Space Telescope Science
        Institute (<a href="../http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/black_holes/" target="_blank">http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/black_holes/</a>). The site
        offers encyclopedic content in both a reference section and as an on-demand
        pop-up window within interactive modules. These modules present puzzling
        questions (e.g. <em>How do you find an invisible object?</em>) as well as
        hands-on experiments for active, trial and error exploration (<em>Can you
          find a safe orbit around a black hole?</em>). The site did not offer social
        interaction with other users, as this requires staff moderation &ndash; a challenge
        for many organizations. Since Discussion was not especially popular even
        with Creative learners, this was not a high priority.</p>
      <p >The fact that adults and children generally agreed on the play value of
        our sample activities indicates that play value should be a central goal.
        On the other hand, Interactive Reference was relatively low in children's
        activity preferences and placed last in both play/work scores and sample
        activity ratings. Children's aversion to Interactive Reference should limit
        its use to homework and research sites and to topics in which children have
        an intrinsic interest.</p>
      <p >For children, the open-ended, exploratory nature of Design and Role-Play
        activities seem to mesh well with their desire for playful activities, across
        learning styles. For topics with content that is suited to Puzzle-Mystery
        or Simulation activities, developers may want to incorporate design or role-play
        elements to broaden their play value and appeal. </p>
      <p >Overall, learning style does influence preference for on-line activities,
        and is yet another way that one size does not fit all. The results of this
        study provide new insight into our unseen audiences, helping us anticipate
        the kinds of experiences to which they will respond. This insight is a valuable
        addition to Web developers' approach and can help them create experiences
        that will appeal to all kinds of learners.</p>
