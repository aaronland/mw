    <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
    <p class="abstractText">This paper presents results of an IMLS-funded study
      (Uses and Potential Uses of Online Information) involving 6,000 national
      household telephone interviews of adults. All 6,000 interviews ask about
      number of in-person or remote (on-line) visits to all types of museums
      (e.g., arboretum, science, historical, children&rsquo;s, etc) and whether
      the number of visits is more, the same as, or less now than in the past.
      One thousand of the interviews deal in-depth with in-person and remote
      visits to museums (including through television programs). The in-depth
      questions about in-person visits include who visited (e.g., by self, with
      family, part of tour group, etc), reasons the museums were visited (e.g.,
      recreational and educational, research, etc.), what was done during the
      visits (e.g., browse, view a specific exhibit, attend a lecture, etc.),
      sources of information used (e.g., audio information, interactive computer,
      etc.), outcomes from the visit (e.g., broadened perspectives on life, inspired,
      encouraged further learning, etc.), ratings of overall satisfaction with
      the visits, exhibits, descriptive information and oral presentations. The
      surveys also examined attributes of information obtained from the museum
      such as their quality, trustworthiness, and so on. A number of questions
      involved children&rsquo;s use of museums by type of museum. Remote visit
      questions involved the type of remote visit to a Web site (e.g., browsing
      through the Web site; viewed a specific exhibit, collection or display;
      learned about a specific topic, etc.); purpose of remote visit (e.g., recreational
      and educational, research, etc.); outcomes from the remote visit for each
      purpose; ratings of overall satisfaction and specific aspects of the visit,
      as well as attributes of specific information from the remote visits.
      Finally, the surveys addressed the value of museums by what users pay in
      their time and other costs to use the museums. We also asked what users
      would do to obtain information observed from the museums if the museums
      were not available and what it would cost them to use alternative sources
      of information. The paper will present specific results of these surveys.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The on-line information environment has changed dramatically since the
      earliest on-line systems emerged in the early 1960s. Growth has occurred
      both in the number of users of on-line information as well as in the number
      of on-line information resources and providers. The rate of growth in each
      of these areas increased exponentially with the availability of the public
      Internet and the World Wide Web. These foundational technological developments
      created an environment in which almost anyone can &lsquo;publish&rsquo; or
      function as an information provider and have virtually instantaneous access
      to massive volumes of information.</p>
    <p>Current data indicate that over 50 % of U.S. households have access to
      the Internet. Furthermore, virtually every public library in the U.S. has
      at least one publicly accessible workstation connected to the Internet.
      Recent research has shown that many individuals use the Internet/Web as
      a large library; however, the Web is not a library in many critical ways
      (Griffiths 1998). Most relevant for this project is the fact that the Web
      gives people the illusion of comprehensiveness: while it does, indeed,
      provide access to an enormous amount of information, there is orders of
      magnitude more information that must be accessed by more traditional means.</p>
    <p>Since the availability of the earliest on-line systems, research has been
      conducted on the users/use, their information needs, and providers/provision
      of an on-line mode. In particular, research has tended to focus on specific
      user population segments or the use of specific on-line resources. Other
      research has investigated the information needs and information seeking
      practices of specific population segments. All these research efforts focus
      on specific pieces of the overall universe of people with information needs,
      the information that can potentially satisfy those needs, and the mechanisms
      and resources that can provide access to the needed information.</p>
    <p>This project, solicited by the Institute of Museum and Library Services
      (IMLS), aims to develop a rich and comprehensive understanding of this
      universe, particularly the on-line information space within it: the people
      who do use or might potentially use on-line information; their information
      needs and expectations, information seeking preferences and behaviors;
      and the information content and service providers who support the needs
      of these people. </p>
    <p>In responding to IMLS&rsquo;s request for proposals, we developed a conceptual
      model which we believe illustrates the size and complexity of the universe
      of users and potential users of on-line information  (see Figure 1). While
      the model reflects hundreds of relevant studies we have worked on, we do
      not intend it to be final, but rather a starting point from which to characterize
      this universe. The model is based on two critical components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>information users - present and potential</li>
      <li>information content, mechanisms and resources that are (or could be)
        utilized by the users</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption">Figure 1: Conceptual Model (<a href="griffiths-figure1.pdf">PDF</a>)</p>
    <p>The user component (blue rectangle) includes characteristics of the user
      population; their needs for information (e.g., a health problem, a school
      homework assignment, a work-related research need, recreational interest,
      cultural attraction); and use of various sources of information (e.g.,
      documents, exhibits); providers of these sources (e.g., libraries, museums);
      and modes of access (e.g., Internet, personal observation). The information
      component (yellow rectangle), starting from the bottom, includes the communication
      mechanisms and resources by which the information is accessed, and their
      attributes; information content attributes; and the outcomes/impact derived
      by users having the information. </p>
    <p>The model shows that the sources, providers, and modes of access possess
      important attributes (e.g., availability, accessibility, price). The use
      of sources, providers and modes of access is influenced by several factors,
      such as user awareness of them, ease of use, and attributes. Amount of
      use can be estimated as a function of these factors, including user perception
      of attributes. Information content also has important attributes that are
      related to meeting the users&rsquo; information needs. For example, accuracy
      and currency are essential to meeting many health-related needs; language
      is important to various population segments - for people with different
      native languages, those learning languages, etc. Finally, use of information
      results in some outcomes (or impact) such as improved student learning,
      time saved, etc. Outcomes can be related to specific segments of the population.
      While there are many possible ways of characterizing the information universe,
      we have found this model to be very useful in our studies of libraries
      and a range of information sources, providers, and access modes (particularly
      the Internet).</p>
    <p>Museums and libraries have long been sources of recreation, learning and
      information for personal, family, educational and workplace purposes. However,
      the Internet, Web and other technologies have become increasingly used
      sources of information that some believe will largely replace their physical
      counterparts. Still, some have speculated that the Internet and related
      technologies will actually enhance and increase museum and library use.
      There is no solid evidence to support either assertion, particularly considering
      the wide range in types of museums and libraries.</p>
    <p>Both museums and libraries of all types have adapted to the Internet by
      providing access to information through the Internet, as well as creating
      and promoting unique information content for users. They also provide access
      to their services through the Internet. This  &ldquo;National Study of
      Users and Potential Users of Online Information&rdquo; has a primary goal
      to &ldquo;Conduct a national survey of the information needs of users and
      potential users of on-line museum and public library information and the
      Internet.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>This paper presents the first reporting of preliminary analysis of museum
      usage.</p>
    <h1>Methods</h1>
    <p>The study involved over 6,000 national household telephone interviews
      using random digit dialing. The surveys were conducted in 2006 and were
      limited to adults aged 18 and over, although some information about children&rsquo;s
      visits was obtained from the adults. Some questions were common to all
      interviews, such as interviewee demographics and use of certain Internet
      services. The remaining questions were organized into four distinct survey
      clusters:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A survey of museum use was conducted to observe the extent of museum
        in-person visits, remote visits to museum Web sites, and television viewing
        of museum exhibits. There are two sources of data: estimates of overall
        museum use (based on 5,303 interviews), and estimates of details of use
        (based on 1,038 interviews).</li>
      <li>A similar survey was conducted to establish information about public
        library use (based on 1,693 interviews).</li>
      <li>A survey of Internet use was performed to determine the extent of Internet
        use, details of the purposes for which the Internet was used, and the
        outcomes of this use (based on 2,020 interviews).</li>
      <li>A survey on general information needs, and sources of information used
        to meet these needs (based on 2,102 interviews). This survey provided
        a context within which to understand why certain sources are used for
        different information needs.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All of the surveys relied heavily on a critical incident observation of
      the last use or visit. The critical incident method allows detailed questions
      to be asked about a specific incident to yield deeper understanding of
      what users actually do during a museum visit.</p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p>The preliminary results presented below relate to the use, usefulness
      and value of museums.</p>
    <h2>Total Museum Use And Trends</h2>
    <p>Museums clearly are a popular destination for the majority of adults in
      the U.S. Over 67% of all adults in the U.S. visited a museum in the past
      year. Adults made a total of 1.0 billion visits, and children aged 3 to
      17 years made 97.8 million visits in the past year. Almost two-thirds (63.2%)
      of adult visits to museums were in-person visits, and just under one third
      (31.7%) were remote Web visits. Of adults who visited a museum in the past
      12 months, a small proportion (6.2%) used remote access exclusively, over
      half (53.0%) visited exclusively in-person, and the remainder (40.8%) visited
      in both modalities. </p>
    <p>The number of museum visits is trending upwards, especially with remote
      access. In-person visits seem fairly stable with 25% indicating they visited
      more often, 23.3% less often and 51% about the same. For remote Web visits,
      38.3% indicated they visited more often, 9.8% less often and 52.1% about
      the same.</p>
    <p>There is a clear positive relationship between in-person visits and remote
      Web visits in that those who visit a museum in-person more frequently also
      tend to visit remotely more, and vice versa.</p>
    <p>The vast majority of adults who visited a museum in the past year did
      so multiple times. For in-person visits, a total of 11.4% of adults visited
      once only, 33.6% visited two to five times, 12.1% visited 6-10 times, and
      6.6% visited eleven or more times. For Website visits, 5.4% of all adults
      visited once only, 16% visited two to five times, 5.1% visited 6-10 times
      and 5.2% visited eleven or more times. </p>
    <h2>Type Of Museum Visited</h2>
    <p>Data were collected on type of museum visited based on the museum categories
      in the American Association of Museums Directory (although some categories
      were combined). The proportion of adults who visited museums in-person
      or via museum Web sites in the past 12 months follows.</p>

    <h2>Reasons For Museum Visits</h2>
    <p>People visit museums for variety of reasons. The vast majority of museum
      visits are for personal, family, informal learning or recreational experiences
      (93 % of in-person visits and 87% of Web visits). More information on these
      visits is included below in the next two sections for in-person and Web
      visits, respectively.</p>
    <p>A small proportion of visits are for formal educational purposes, both
      by students (2% of in-person visits and 5% of Web visits) and by teachers
      (2% of in-person visits and 6% of Web visits), and for work-related purposes
      by writers, consultants, etc. (3% of in-person visits and 1% of Web visits). </p>
    <h3>In-Person Visits To Museums </h3>
    <p>The majority (68.2%) of in-person museum visits are with family, almost
      half of which included children under the age of 18, or with friends and
      colleagues (24.8%). A relatively small but not insignificant proportion
      of adult visits were alone (9.5%) or with a tour group (8.2%).</p>
    <p>Visits that included children account for 29.5% of all visits, with an
      average of 3 children per visit. Almost two-thirds (63.1%) of these visits
      included 1 or 2 children, one-third (30.0%) included 3-5 children, and
      the remainder (6.9%) involved more than 5 children (with a maximum number
      reported of 80).</p>
    <p>People engaged in a variety of activities during their last visit to a
      museum:</p>

    <h1>Outcomes Of Museum Visits</h1>
    <p>The outcomes of museum visits vary considerably by the purposes for which
      museums are used: personal/family recreation/entertainment; education both
      as student or teacher; and work-related. As shown earlier, the vast majority
      of adult museum visits are for personal or family informal learning and
      recreation. Key outcomes of museum visits include the following.</p>

    <p class="caption">Table 8: Needs met through in-person or Web visits</p>
    <p>It is clear from the above results that the shared experience of in-person
      museum visits is important to those who visit in-person, and to a much
      lesser degree to Web visitors. On the other hand, it would appear that
      Web visitors more often have something specific in mind when they visit,
      as opposed to those who are visiting museums in-person. Furthermore, all
      museum visits for formal education or workplace purposes resulted in people
      finding some or all of what they were seeking. </p>
    <h1>Ratings Of Museum Experiences</h1>
    <p>Visitors were asked to rate their satisfaction with their last museum
      experience. The scale used was a five-point scale with 1 representing an
      experience less satisfying than they expected and 5 representing a fully
      satisfying experience. Overall, people were very satisfied with their museum
      experiences - with in-person visits rated on average very slightly higher
      (4.37) than on-line visits (4.04).</p>
    <p>Visitors were also asked to rate various aspects of museums on a five-point
      scale with 1 representing the worst rating and 5 representing the best
      rating. In all cases the in-person visits resulted in higher average ratings.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Aspects of Museums</th>
        <th>In-person visit rating</th>
        <th>Web visit rating</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Exhibits</td>
        <td>4.35</td>
        <td>3.84</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Oral or audio presentations describing displays or items</td>
        <td>4.30</td>
        <td>3.69</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Quality of descriptive information about displays or items</td>
        <td>4.39</td>
        <td>3.95</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Trustworthiness of the displays or exhibits </td>
        <td>4.62</td>
        <td>4.55</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="caption">Table 9: Rating of various aspects of museums, in-person
      and Web visits</p>
    <p>It is clear that museums are considered trusted sources, with ratings
      of trust very similar for both in-person and Web visits. </p>
    <h1>Value of Museums </h1>
    <p>Those who use museums invest their time, travel expenses, etc. to visit
      and spend time engaged with museum exhibits, collections, programs, etc.
      This individual investment is a discretionary one and can be considered
      an indication of the value that visitors place on museums. In-person visitors
      to museums spend an average of 2.2 hours traveling to and from the museum
      and 2.9 hours in the museum. They also spend a per-visit average of $21.50
      in driving, $2.00 for parking, $6.90 for transportation and $7.80 for entrance
      fees. Thus, the total visitor investment in museums is 5.1 hours plus $38.20
      per visit. Web visitors to museums invest much less, with an average of
      0.8 hours per visit.</p>
    <p>Visitors were asked, for their last visit, what they would have done if
      the museums had not been available. Some indicated they would not have
      bothered to use another source (29.4% of in-person visits, 9.7% of Web
      visits). Others indicated that they needed the information or experience
      but did not know where they would go to find it (10.5% of in-person visits,
      7.5% of Web visits). Still others indicated that they would use another
      source (60.1% of in-person visits, 82.8% of Web visits).</p>
    <p>The cost to use alternative sources can also provide an indicator of value
      to the visitor. For 60.1 % of the in-person visits, people actually were
      willing to pay 3.7 hours and $27.50 per visit more than known alternatives
      to visit the museums themselves. For 82.8 % of the Web visits, the convenience
      of the Web saved them 4 hours and $107.20 per visit.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion </h1>
    <p>It is clear that museums are used by the majority of the adult U.S. population,
      with 67 % or 157 million adults visiting a museum in the past year. These
      adults account for 1 billion museum visits per year in-person and through
      the Web. Children aged 3-17 account for an additional 97.8 million visits.
      People visit museums for a variety of reasons and they derive a variety
      of positive outcomes. The opportunity to experience the museum, exhibits,
      collections and programs with family and friends is a particularly important
      feature. The value to adult visitors in terms of time spent and time saved
      through the use of museums in the past year is in excess of 4.9 billion
      hours plus $54.6 billion. </p>
