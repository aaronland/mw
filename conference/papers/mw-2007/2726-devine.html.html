    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This demonstration session showcases current research in the field of
      museums studies undertaken by students for the Masters of Liberal Arts
      in Museum Studies course at Harvard Extension School in the current academic
      session.  The showcased projects have been selected for their relevance
      to the Museums and the Web constituency, and we believe they will provide
      valuable insight into some of the latest trends and developments in the
      field of museum practice in the use of technology.</p>
    <p>The session builds upon recent trends in collaborative research between
      the Harvard Museum Studies program and the Hunterian Museum at the University
      of Glasgow, Scotland, on User-oriented approaches to museum Web and multimedia
      development and the use and extent of on-line resources being employed
      in the museum community and their impact on users at remote locations.  </p>
    <p>This collaboration was largely born out of the &ldquo;What Clicks?&rdquo; Project
      (reported at MW 2004 Washington DC (Devine 2004) and ICHIM 2004 Berlin
      (Devine 2004) which reviewed the existing and potential capability, human
      and technological, within the museum sector in Scotland in the use of ICT
      to increase public access and resulting learning opportunities to museum
      collections.  The project was carried out by Jim Devine and his team
      at the Hunterian and peer-reviewed by Kathy Jones and her team at Harvard.  </p>
    <p>The Harvard researchers will outline their projects and present case studies
      based on current research at Harvard University and at the Hunterian.  Employing
      on-line surveys as well as one-on-one interviews with museum educators,
      curators and exhibition staff, the Harvard assessment looks at how students
      (K-12, and adult learners) and the general public use existing museum electronically-delivered
      resources, assesses where the technology is going, and provides feedback
      on how museums might employ that technology to further address the desired,
      indeed <em>required</em>, outcome of <em>access for all</em> visitors.</p>
    <h2>The Connected Classroom: A Study of Art Museum Resources
      Designed for the K-12 Audience  - Jason Springer <strong></strong></h2>
    <p>How can the partnerships between schools and art museums be built upon
      or streamlined by the use of electronic media to provide improved access
      to museum resources and give users better learning experiences?</p>
    <p>In order to address the central concepts in the above question as it relates
      to the working relationships between schools and art museums in New England,
      the author is pursuing research with three thematic areas of investigation.  Broadly
      categorized, these areas are: The Museum, The School, and The Students.  In
      each area, data will be gathered to determine the current usage of electronic
      media, the limitations of its usage, and the benefits and pitfalls of electronic
      media, and then attempt to identify areas of potential growth.  Furthermore,
      the research will more clearly make a needs assessment of each party involved
      in an art museum/school partnership and thereby promote more efficient
      and productive learning relationships.</p>
    <p>In pursuit of the overarching goal of improving art museum and school
      partnerships, the thesis has six objectives:  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>review and evaluate the electronic resources that are currently available
        on the Web sites of art museums in the New England area</li>
      <li>identify good practices and areas of improvement for the museum community</li>
      <li>produce recommendations for the preparation and delivery of electronic
        resources</li>
      <li>survey user groups to understand their needs in an educational context</li>
      <li>promote increased public access to art museum collections and other
        educational resources through electronic media</li>
      <li>promote alternative learning styles and opportunities</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Museum</h3>
    <p>Phase 1 of the thesis explores electronic resources designed for museum/school
      partnerships from the museum&rsquo;s perspective and addresses issues in
      their presentation and availability.  Through understanding the museum
      educators&rsquo; perception of their roles, expectations, and limitations
      within a school partnership, the museum will be better able to make strategic
      decisions in planning educational programming, digitization projects, implementing
      Web site expansion, and doing a host of other activities that involve their
      public learning initiatives.</p>
    <p>The research has begun with a comprehensive survey distributed on-line
      to 45 New England art museums.  The survey focuses on museum resources
      specifically designed for teachers and school age audiences.  Areas
      of investigation include audience, digital collections, museum resources,
      and outreach and education.  The data collected from the survey will
      help characterize how electronic media is being used to reach a specific
      audience and suggest strategies to utilize technology to improve outreach
      and education.  The Web site of each museum is being evaluated on
      type and quality of educational content, its usability, and target audience
      appropriateness.  In addition, follow-up interviews are providing
      the research with more nuanced, qualitative data to incorporate into the
      quantitative survey data.</p>
    <p>Further study will involve the effectiveness of specific types of educational
      content and Web activities and the actual uses of on-line collections.</p>
    <h3>The School</h3>
    <p>Phase 2 of the thesis addresses the issues involved on the school and
      teacher side of a partnership.  By understanding the complete set
      of issues surrounding teachers in a museum partnership, museums will benefit
      by more clearly understanding how to design and deliver resources to them.  Museums
      will also benefit by being able to better address partnership planning
      and program and Web site development for a specific audience.</p>
    <p>A second, specially designed survey is being distributed on-line to a
      large number of teachers using an on-line polling program.  The central
      themes of the survey include teachers&rsquo; perspectives on museum resources,
      digital collections, object-based learning, and the virtual field trip.  For
      example, one of the areas that the survey explores is what conditions would
      enable teachers to use museum Web sites and digital art objects more often
      in classroom lessons,  Also, another issue is what types of content
      and supporting materials are identified as most useful for teachers who
      want to use art museum objects.  By extension, the survey is exploring
      how computers are currently being used within the classroom and to what
      extent museum Web sites can be integrated into the curriculum -  and
      in some cases, the limitations that prevent  Web site use.  In
      addition, the survey is exploring how the museum experience or &ldquo;field
      trip&rdquo; is being integrated into classroom activities and the perception
      of the potential for learning from a virtual field trip.  </p>
    <p>Further study on this topic will involve the utilization of object-based
      learning techniques in the classroom and the establishment of the extent
      teachers could use digital images of actual art objects as a foundation
      or entry point into a learning experience or subject.</p>
    <h3>The Students</h3>
    <p>Phase 3 of the thesis addresses the issues involved in learning from museum
      objects and the uses of a museum Web site by students in the middle and
      high-school grades.  By understanding student expectations and seeing
      how students use and respond to museum content, museum educators can improve
      that content and better design it to benefit this audience.  Correspondingly,
      teachers will understand more accurately how to approach the learning behaviors
      of their students with museum objects and adjust their pedagogy to better
      utilize museum knowledge.  In addition, when museums better understand
      their audience of young learners in the museum/school partnership, they
      can then construct lessons and information more efficiently and deliver
      it in a manner that maximizes learning potential.  Furthermore, the
      museum can benefit over the long run from a positive learning relationship
      with students by virtue of becoming relevant to the younger generations
      who will inevitably become the museums&rsquo; primary supporters.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of gathering student data, a paper survey is being used
      to present specially designed questions to this user group.  The central
      aim of the student survey is to clearly identify this user group&rsquo;s
      level of tech-savvy and their resulting needs in an on-line learning context.  The
      goal of the survey is to identify why content is accessed and how students
      incorporate art museum content into their projects and activities.  The
      data is attempting to classify a category of learner called the &ldquo;techno-author.&rdquo;  It
      asks if podcasts and podcasting are ways that students want to use, manipulate,
      absorb, and interact with museum content.  This line of questioning
      attempts to affirm that student user groups are learners who utilize technology
      in various forms to manipulate information or &ldquo;author&rdquo; their
      learning experience into something that is uniquely their own.</p>
    <p>Further research will include a comparative study on the level of cognitive
      benefits and concept retention of the traditional &ldquo;field trip&rdquo; as
      compared to the on-line or virtual field trip, and will be accompanied
      by a thorough evaluation of how learning on-line differs from traditional
      methods of instruction.  In addition, an evaluation will be made on
      the viability of digital collections as the primary object in a learning
      experience in an attempt to uncover those times in the academic and social
      life of students when, on the path of self-directed learning, the digital
      object will suffice as the entry point or catalyst for what would traditionally
      be called an object-based learning experience.  Following a review
      of the survey data, the author will present a selection of case studies
      from the 45 New England art museums in order to highlight notable strategies
      for the presentation and distribution of museum resources to the school
      audience.  Topics covered will include interactive activities, collections
      databases, podcasting, and CD-ROMs</p>
    <h2>Museum Podcasting            Feasibility
      Analysis            -  Kurt
      Stuchell</h2>
    <p class="URL"><a href="../http://www.museumpods.com/" target="_blank">www.museumpods.com</a></p>
    <p>Kurt Stuchell will present his research on The Museum Podcasting Feasibility
      Analysis, which examines the effectiveness of the RSS subscription technology
      as a delivery mechanism for educational programs, marketing and community
      outreach.  This session is geared toward museum professionals interested
      in better understanding the potential impact of podcasting for museums
      and toward organizations thinking about developing a podcasting program.            </p>
    <p>The presentation will cover the concept of podcasting using RSS subscriptions,
      the lifecycle of podcasts, podcasting genres, the findings from surveys
      of museum staff and museum constituents, and will also make predictions
      of what the future holds for museums which adopt the technology.  </p>
    <p>Podcasting is one of the fastest growing technologies on the Internet
      and, accordingly, it is creating a buzz in the museum community as museum
      professionals gauge its utility to further their programming goals.  Cost
      effectiveness and synergies with museum objectives to reach core and new
      audiences will be explored.  Examples of a diverse group of museums
      that  are having early successes in applying podcasting technology
      emphasize the compelling nature and versatility of the tool.</p>
    <p>A growing number of people are downloading podcasts, making demographic
      segmentation an area of interest.  Understanding who is listening
      to museum podcasts depends on the museums&rsquo; publication and distribution
      platform, whether it is iTunes&trade;, MuseumPods&trade;, MySpace&trade;,
      a museum Web site, or a combination of these channels.  While preliminary
      feedback provides some interesting insights regarding podcast audiences,
      not a great deal is known about who is listening to museum podcasts. </p>
    <p>Everyone wants to know how to get started with podcasting.  A primer
      for producing and distributing RSS podcasts includes basic technology components,
      necessary skills, and availability and accessibility issues.  There
      are a variety of options available today to start a RSS podcasting program
      with little cost or technical expertise, but some hurdles do exist for
      museums when producing and distributing podcasts in the current Internet
      environment.  Soon to be available emerging technology will reduce
      the barrier of entry for museums wishing to start or enhance existing podcast
      programs.  The &ldquo;lifecycle&rdquo; of podcasts, including vision,
      assessment, design, production, distribution, and listener feedback, will
      be reviewed.</p>
    <p>A wide variety of podcast genres are being created.  Podcasting can
      do more than just showcase an existing exhibition, audio or video tour;
      it is a compelling distribution mechanism to showcase <em>Hidden Treasures</em> in
      a museum storage facility for which there is no exhibition space.  Using
      an RSS Feed of a slide show presentation can increase exposure of objects
      that cannot be displayed in a traditional &ldquo;brick and mortar&rdquo; environment.  These
      virtual exhibitions play to a <em>predefined audience,</em> unlike Web
      site images, streaming audio, or video.  </p>
    <p>A comparison of results from surveys conducted in April 2006 and January
      2007 soliciting opinions from museum staff and visitors about their knowledge
      of podcasting will be reviewed.  Interpretation of the survey results
      argues for pervasive adoption of podcasting technology by museums.</p>
    <p>Podcasting is an effective, affordable distribution mechanism for educational
      programming, displaying <em>Hidden Treasures</em>, doing outreach, and
      marketing for museums.  Recommendations will be given for the next
      steps in starting a podcasting program, Web sites for further self study,
      museum podcast directories, and a list of award winning museum podcasts.</p>
    <h2> Museums and the &ldquo;Digital Curb Cut&rdquo;: <strong>Leveraging Universal
        Design Principles and Multimedia Technology to Deliver Accessible, Rich-Media
        Learning Experiences On-line - Wendy Constantine            </strong></h2>
    <p>The expansion of broadband Internet connectivity has enabled museums and
      cultural institutions to reach an increasingly diverse audience of life-long
      learners. Over the course of the past decade, museums have experimented
      with delivering media-based, educational experiences on-line to share their
      vast repositories of knowledge collected with the on-line public. In fact,
      due to constraints of time, geographic location, money and disabilities,
      visitors to on-line exhibitions have in many cases far outnumbered attendees
      at the physical installations in the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo; site.
      On-line exhibitions can outlive their physical counterparts for many years
      and serve as a documentation of the knowledge presented for interested
      persons across the globe. However, unless universal design principles are
      considered in the early stages of the media, the educational experiences
      will not be accessible to all persons equally.</p>
    <p>The largely experimental uses of Web-based multimedia technology of the
      past are now slowly giving way to more strategic understandings of the
      medium and the potential audiences it can serve. Standards-based design
      and development practices are becoming the norm both inside and outside
      the cultural sector. However, museums and cultural institutions, both in
      the United States and abroad, are increasingly under pressure by grant-writers
      and the government to not exclude disabled persons from accessing cultural
      knowledge online. As the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990
      required museums to examine the accessibility of their physical environments
      to a diverse public, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act in the United
      States is providing legal motivation for museums to better understand how
      their online content is experienced by persons with disabilities. Today,
      already 49.7 million Americans or 19.3% of the population have reported
      a long lasting condition or disability (Waldrop &amp; Stern, 2003, pg.
      1). </p>
    <p>As the baby-boomer generation begins to reach retirement age in 2011,
      the largest segment of the population will increasingly develop function
      limitations and sensory disabilities. It is also important to note that
      this demographic will also be the primary demographic for trustees and
      donors in the cultural sector.</p>
    <p> Museums have begun to assess their public Web sites for technical
      barriers to accessibility. However, the accessibility of multimedia assets
      delivered on-line has largely been ignored to date. Automated tests cannot
      confirm if a selection of video or audio complies with Section 508 regulations,
      and there is little mention of non-html based development in the Web Content
      Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to guide multimedia developers towards
      accessible solutions. Perhaps most important, museums have not yet learned
      how to negotiate accessibility requirements with their contracted developers;
      the lack of institutional policies for requiring accessibility for multimedia
      projects has also contributed to the situation. If museums do not contractually
      require that videos be captioned, podcasts be transcribed, or text versions
      be available for Flash-based programs, developers will likely not produce
      them. </p>
    <p>The next generation of on-line educational content published by museums
      will likely shift towards a proactive, user-centered approach intending
      to widen their audience and understand the diverse needs of their on-line
      visitors. The growth of ubiquitous mobile computing devices is also driving
      the need for flexible, user-configured experiences of media. As a symposium
      of forward-thinking technology researchers agreed in 1997, media producers
      should no longer assume that the people who want to use their media are
      sitting at a desk with a computer monitor, have perfect vision and hearing,
      and can manipulate a mouse (National Research Council, 1997). Previously,
      these assumptions drove the format and interaction design of multimedia.
      In fact, the user may be driving in a car, sitting in a quiet gallery or
      library, walking down a noisy street - or be practically anywhere. Furthermore,
      the communication device itself may limit users&rsquo;ability to interact
      with the content to a single modality, resembling the limitations of persons
      with sensory disabilities.</p>
    <p>Just as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 required cities and
      towns across America to rebuild their sidewalks at intersections to accommodate
      the disabled, creating what has been called &ldquo;simply better sidewalks&rdquo; for
      all citizens (Jacobs, 2002, para 1), the digital &ldquo;curb cut&rdquo; promises
      to place the user&rsquo;s needs and diverse requirements at the center
      of multimedia design.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>We hope that the research presented will provide a useful insight for
      delegates into some of the issues involved for museums in seeking to ensure
      that the resources they develop for electronic delivery and distribution
      meet the aspiration of &ldquo;access for all.&rdquo; It should also help
      to keep the ideal of enablement of users, regardless of abilities, in the
      forefront of our minds, as we develop ever more diverse and innovative
      uses of technology to open up our collections to the connected visitors
      of today and tomorrow.</p>
