    <p class="abstractText">This
        paper examines the extent to which user-centred design can be applied
        to the development of effective learning experiences in museum Web sites.
        If it is good practice to formatively test Web designs during development
        to ensure they deliver what they are supposed to, then arguably this
        applies as much to learning activities as well. But we cannot test predictively
        if we don't know what the design is intended to achieve. So if the purpose
        is to support and encourage learning, then specifying learning outcomes
        is essential. While some authors argue that specific learning outcomes
        are undesirable because they limit the usability or relevance of an activity,
        this paper suggests that they are essential because they offer a benchmark
        against which designers, Museum directors and funding bodies can measure
        how effective the investment of time, money, and imagination has been.
        Prediction is not the same as prescription, and well designed learning
        activities based on predictive learning outcomes need not result in learning
        activities that proscribe alternative uses. </p>

      <h1>The Importance Of Learning In Museums</h1>
    <p>Debate
        about the importance of education and learning in museums has a long
        history. As far back as 1942, The Committee on Education of the American
        Association of Museums commissioned a report on the educational problems
        of museums (Low 1942). While acknowledging that museums have a threefold
        purpose: collection, scholarship, and education, Low recommended that
        museums should base their future identity and purpose on education. This
        view was echoed 40 years later when the American Association of Museums&rsquo; report
        of the Commission on Museums for a New Century (American Association
        of Museums 1984) concluded that education would be among the primary
        issues facing museums in the 21st century.</p>
    <p>Of course,
        this is not just an American perspective. The potential of museums to
        support and encourage learning is generally recognised. The UK Museums
        Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) notes that museums &ldquo;can make
        a real difference to people&rsquo;s lives by using their collections
        for inspiration, learning and enjoyment&rdquo; (MLA 2001). Between 1999
        and 2004 the UK Department for Education and Science invested &pound;4
        million specifically in schools-focused museums and gallery learning
        through the Museums and Galleries Education Programme (MGEP). In April,
        2004, the Department for Education and Science and the Department for
        Culture, Media and Sport announced a joint investment of more than &pound;7
        million over the following two years to strengthen the capacity of museums
        and galleries to support children and young people's education (DfES
        2004). In a joint introduction to the Department of Education and Employment&rsquo;s
        report on the learning power of museums, the then (2000) UK Secretaries
        of State for Education and for Culture Media and Sport said:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Learning is at the heart of this Government&rsquo;s
      agenda because it is the key to a rich life for individuals and prosperity
      for the nation&hellip;. the Government is seeking to create the &lsquo;learning
      habit&rsquo; across the country, so that people of all ages can understand
      and enjoy the great cultural achievements of the past and the present,
      and gain the skills, attitudes and knowledge they need to contribute to
      and share in the information and communication age of this new century    (Smith
      and Blunkett 2000).</p>
    <p>In 2006,
        86% of UK museums were used by formal educational groups and 88% by informal
        education groups; 40% of museums reported
        outreach to community groups, and 29% of museums reported outreach to
        older visitors (MLA 2006). </p>
    <p>On-line
        exhibits attract visitors from a wide range of backgrounds (Marable 2004).
        Not surprisingly, therefore, we are seeing increasing forays into learning
        by museums through their Web sites. In 2006, 27%
        of museums reported on-line activity / e-learning by formal education
        groups.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Museums
        are being reinvented as physical and virtual spaces in which people engage
        and learn, interacting with objects and discovering their stories. Interweaving
        the real and the virtual creates a powerful brand, enabling museums to
        occupy centre stage in cultural cyberspace (MLA 2001).</p>
    <h1>Why Return On Investment Matters For Museum Web Designers</h1>
    <p>Web
        site investment costs are non-trivial. At the V&amp;A, the on-line Museum
        costs for 2005/6 were &pound;452,266, including staff (V&amp;A 2005a).
        The <em>Making the Modern World</em> exhibition
        at the National Science Museum, London, alone cost &pound;500,000. Even
        leaving aside staff costs, annual non-staff budgets for Web development
        at major UK national museums range from &pound;20,000 to &pound;150,000
        (NMOLP 2006). The consequences of getting it wrong can be damaging in
        terms of not only waste of money but also public perception of and attitudes
        towards the institution. The importance of Web sites to Museums&rsquo; strategies
        is evident from the level of traffic they attract and the budgets allocated
        to them. For example, visits to the Natural History Museum, London, Web
        site (<a href="../http://www.nhm.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.nhm.ac.uk</a>) rose
        from 1.7 million in 2000 to 3.1 million in 2001 (NHM 2001). The Victoria
        and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) Web site (<a href="../http://www.vam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.vam.ac.uk</a>)
        had 1.1 million user sessions in 2001/2002, rising to over 6 million
        in 2004/2005 (V&amp;A 2005b). Significantly, 20% of the V&amp;A Web site
        visitors in 2003 had never visited the physical Museum, demonstrating
        the powerful outreach effects of the Web site (V&amp;A 2003). Return
        on investment is an important issue, therefore, that most Museum managers
        cannot ignore. This has important implications for Museum Web developers.
        It is important that we develop sites that work well and that we do so
        as efficiently as possible. But how can we demonstrate that our designs
        are effective and, more important, how can we predict reliably, before
        a significant investment has been made, how effective a particular design
        is likely to be?</p>
    <h1>Using User-Centred Design To Predict Design Performance</h1>
    <p>User-centred
        design (Katz-Haas 1998, Vergo et al 2001) offers a methodology for ensuring
        designs are effective by closely matching them to user expectations and
        needs, based on user requirements analysis and testing. This approach
        makes the user rather than the product the focus of attention:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">User-Centered Design (UCD) is a user interface
      design process that focuses on usability goals, user characteristics, environment,
      tasks, and workflow in the design of an interface. UCD follows a series
      of well-defined methods and techniques for analysis, design, and evaluation
      of mainstream hardware, software, and Web interfaces. The UCD process is
      an iterative process, where design and evaluation steps are built in from
      the first stage of projects, through implementation  (Henry and Martinson
      2003).</p>
    <p>The
        results of the user trials are fed back into the design process to shape
        the design ideas formatively. A typical sequence of design and evaluation
        is shown in figure1, and figure 2 shows low cost early paper prototypes
        used for testing.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="brown_figure1.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Typical user-centred design-test cycles" width="400" height="226" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 1:
        Typical user-centred design-test cycles.</p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 2:
        Paper prototypes used for early testing.</p>
    <p>User-centred
        design is not a new concept in museums (Arseneault and Robert 2003; Jefsoutine
        et al 2004; Mitroff et al 2003; Peacock et al 2004; Vergo, et al
        2001). </p>
    <p>Implicit
        in this approach is the idea that what the final product should be able
        to do is both knowable in advance and measurable. By being able to measure
        typical user responses to successively more sophisticated design drafts,
        we can adjust the design to accommodate user requirements as closely
        as possible. Therefore, providing we can specify the intended learning
        outcomes of museum Web sites, user-centred design should enable us to
        predict with some confidence how well the final product will perform </p>
    <h1>Using Learning Outcomes As Measures Of Performance</h1>
    <p>The
        idea of measuring the learning outcomes of cultural organisations is
        not new. Increasingly, museums are seen as instruments to implement policies
        on social inclusion, cohesion and access (Lawley 2003, Sandell 2003)
        and are required to present evidence of their contributions (Hooper-Greenhill
        2004). In the UK this has become a serious issue for publicly funded
        museums, galleries and archives. Funding levels across the sector are
        contingent on being able to present such evidence (Selwood 2001). </p>
    <p>In formal
        education, learning outcomes, or learning &ldquo;objectives&rdquo; as
        they are sometime called, are used to assess the extent to which the
        learner, the teacher and the learning activity have been successful.
        The essence of a well-formulated learning outcome is that it should be
        specific, objective and measurable (Bloom et al 1956, Mager 1984). That
        is to say, it should define unambiguously what the learner should be
        able to do in terms that make it feasible for themselves and others to
        reliably measure their performance. For example, &ldquo;at the end of
        this paragraph you, the reader, should be able to explain what learning
        outcomes are in terms of their distinguishing characteristics, purpose
        and context&rdquo; is a learning outcome that could be applied to the
        activity of reading this paragraph. Specified learning outcomes allow
        educationalists to
        apply user-centred design principles to curriculum development. Learning
        activities can be tested against their intended outcomes in draft form
        with the help of volunteers or sample learners to assess how well they
        work. Distance learning and on-line teaching institutions such as the
        UK Open University make considerable use of this kind of iterative developmental
        testing (Brown et al 1981) because courses, once offered to fee paying
        students, have to be robust, fit for purpose and right first time. </p>
    <p>So can
        we apply the concept of learning outcomes to learning activity design
        in museum Web sites? While attempts have been made to draw upon theories
        of learning to inform the design of learning activities in museums (Cassels,
        1992; Davis and Gardner, 1993), some commentators have pointed out that
        there are limits to the transferability of such theories because of significant
        differences between learners in formal contexts, such as schools, and
        informal contexts such as museums (Low 1942, American Association of
        Museums 1984, Hooper-Greenhill 1991, 1992, Hein 1998, Clarke 2001). Moussouri
        (2002), for example, argues that the museum audience is so much more
        diverse in terms of age, interests, knowledge, skills and motivations
        than a registered student that what the visitor wants from a learning
        experience is essentially unknowable in advance and therefore learning
        outcomes for activities cannot be specified except very broadly. But
        if we cannot specify learning outcomes, then arguably we cannot measure
        them, and if we cannot measure them, then how can we demonstrate the
        overall impact that museums, archives and libraries have on people's
        informal, lifelong learning (Hooper-Greenhill 2004)?</p>
    <h1>Alternative Ways Of Measuring
        Learning Impact: Emergent Vs Predictive</h1>
    <h2>Emergent Outcomes</h2>
    <p>The
        stakes are high, and in the UK the search for appropriate metrics has
        led to the development of a system of Generic Learning Outcomes for measuring
        the impact of museums on learners that attempts to side-step the difficulty
        of matching intended learning outcomes with learner requirements by distinguishing
        between <em>intended</em> learning outcomes and <em>actual</em> learning
        outcomes (Hooper-Greenhill et al 2004) Actual learning outcomes, it is
        argued (Hooper Greenhill 2004), can be grouped into five generic types: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Knowledge
        and Understanding</li>
      <li>Skills</li>
      <li>Attitudes
        and Values</li>
      <li>Enjoyment,
        Inspiration, Creativity</li>
      <li>Action,
        Behaviour, Progression </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Knowledge
          and Understanding</strong> is
          about acquiring facts but also about making connections.</p>
    <p><strong>Skills</strong> include
        intellectual, social, emotional and physical skills.</p>
    <p><strong>Attitudes
          and Values</strong> cover
          feelings, perceptions, opinions, attitudes and awareness.</p>
    <p><strong>Enjoyment,
          Inspiration, Creativity</strong> is
          a combination of feelings, such as enjoyment, and evidence of creative
          activity, such as exploration, experimentation and making.</p>
    <p><strong>Action,
          Behaviour, Progression</strong> refers
          to what people do during or after the activity, or what their intended
          further actions will be. </p>
    <p>Tables
        1 and 2 show typical sets of results of learning impact assessments carried

    et al. (2004)</span></p>
    <p>Focused
        as they are on user-defined, post hoc measures of impact, Generic Learning
        Outcomes can be characterised as &ldquo;<em>emergent</em>&rdquo;. That
        is to say, they emerge from the interaction between learner and learning
        experience, focusing on the actual learning outcomes rather than any
        intentions on the part of the designers.</p>
    <p>This
        shift in focus to emergent learning impact has very real advantages for
        museum directors and funding bodies seeking to assess overall value for
        money and to justify allocations of resources. (Within two years of its
        launch, around half of museums in the UK are using a Generic Learning
        Outcomes based evaluation framework: MLA 2006). It provides a way of
        assessing the extent to which the museum experience has had a positive
        effect on the visitor that goes considerably beyond basic measures such
        as visitor numbers and &ldquo;happy sheet&rdquo; questions (ie. &ldquo;How
        much did you enjoy your visit to our museum today?&rdquo; ) But from
        a design perspective, it has a major flaw. The way these Generic Learning
        Outcomes are measured tends to be subjective. They are judgments made
        by the participants either about the impact of the experience on themselves
        or on others (for example, by teachers about their students). So, for
        example, in Tables  1 and 2, the results reported are all opinions
        rather than objective measures. Under this regime, the best learning
        activity design will be the one that engenders the most positive responses,
        but until the design has undergone extensive testing with large numbers
        of participants, its overall impact on users will not be apparent. There
        will not be enough interactions for the overall pattern to emerge. &ldquo;Actual
        learning outcomes in this model may not emerge until a period of time
        has elapsed&rdquo; (Clarke 2001: 26). Given the tight budgetary and time
        constraints that surround most Web development projects, lengthy field
        trials are usually out of the question during the development phase.
        This effectively leaves the designer without a tool for testing the effectiveness
        of the design until most of the investment has been made.</p>
    <h2>Predictive Outcomes</h2>
    <p>So while
        emergent learning outcomes are useful for retrospective assessment of
        overall impact, they are of little use for supporting a developmental
        user-centred design approach. We need &ldquo;<em>predictive</em>&rdquo; measures
        to assess performance iteratively against intended learning outcomes.</p>
    <p>The
        argument against building museum learning activities around predictive
        learning outcomes is that &ldquo;since each individual learns in their
        own way, using their own preferred learning styles, and according to
        what they want to know, each individual experiences their own outcomes
        from learning&rdquo; (Hooper-Greenhill et al 2004). It follows from this
        that attempts to specify predictive learning outcomes are undesirable
        and impractical: undesirable because they restrictively prescribe learner
        behaviours, and impractical because the visitor will use learning activities
        in quite unpredictable ways (Hooper-Greenhill 2004). &ldquo;Learners
        construct meaning on their own terms no matter what teachers do&rdquo; (Richardson
        1997). We reject this view not only because of its intrinsic internal
        contradiction but also  because it represents a misunderstanding
        of the purpose of predictive learning outcomes. Just because a well-designed
        learning activity is set up to support a particular learning outcome
        does not prevent it from being used to deliver a range of different outcomes,
        depending on the users&rsquo; needs and imaginations   &ndash; just as
        a cup can be relied upon to contain hot coffee safely, but it can also
        be used for cutting pastry circles, for propping open the door, for throwing
        as  a missile, or for providing hardcore for your new driveway. Well-designed
        learning activities will help learners achieve particular goals if those
        goals are what the learners want to achieve. But if the learners feel
        inspired to do something different with the resources that make up the
        learning activity, then, unless it&rsquo;s a piece of programmed
        learning, they should be no more disadvantaged than if they were presented
        with an unstructured set of resources and invited to construct their
        own learning activity. </p>
    <p>Clarke
        (2001: 26) suggests that: &ldquo;If you see your project as a means to
        meet individual learning needs and meaning-making, you will need to plan
        for open-ended, flexible and multi-layered outcomes.&rdquo; This could
        be interpreted as meaning that the designer should not be concerned with
        devising activities that support particular kinds of outcome. But this
        would be to miss the point. Designing for flexible, multiple outcomes
        is not the same as planning for no outcomes at all, and so it still requires
        the developer to think carefully about what outcomes the activity could
        engender and what support the learners might need to achieve those outcomes.
        In other words, we need to &ldquo;provide for differentiated outcomes
        for a range of types of learner&rdquo; (ibid) by &ldquo;scaffolding&rdquo; their
        learning experience. Scaffolding (Vygotsky 1978) refers to the creation
        of a structure that supports learning by anticipating difficulties and
        offering guidance and feedback so that the learners may learn exploratively
        but within a framework that helps them to</p>
    <ul>
      <li>understand
        what they are doing and why (ie it supports meta cognition and purposeful
        behaviour)</li>
      <li>check
        on their understanding</li>
      <li>overcome
        typical misunderstandings and barriers to learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Resistance
        to traditional learning outcomes seems to stem from confusion between &ldquo;predictive&rdquo; and &ldquo;prescriptive&rdquo;.
        Prescriptive activities have predetermined outcomes such that the learner
        is either right or wrong. In other words, &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; use
        is proscribed by the design of the activity itself. </p>

    <p>Figure
        3 shows two activities from the learning modules in the UK National Science
        Museum Web site <em>Making the Modern World</em> (<a href="../http://makingthemodernworld.org/" target="_blank">http://makingthemodernworld.org</a>).
        Typically they comprise some content plus an exercise of some kind. The
        content comprises narrative media, such as text, and various multimedia
        components, such as animations and slide shows. The associated exercises
        variously invite learners to &ldquo;explore&rdquo; (i.e. read, watch
        and listen to) some narrative and then perform some actions such as answer
        multiple choice questions, match up some phrases, or take notes. For
        example, in the activity: &lsquo;Examining the Evidence of Child Labour&rsquo;,
        learners are asked:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">From the interview, what phrases could be used
      to justify the regulation or limitation of child labour? To answer: Write
      five or six short sentences in note form, or alternatively a paragraph
      as your answer. You must include words and phrases from the extract. Then
      submit. You can print out and keep your answer, so try and make it long
      and comprehensive enough to be a good record of your work.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote"><a href="../http://makingthemodernworld.org/learning_modules/history/01.TU.01/?section=11" target="_blank">http://makingthemodernworld.org/learning_modules/history/01.TU.01/?section=11</a></p>
    <p>From
        the requirement to &ldquo;include words and phrases from the extract&rdquo; and
        the advice to &ldquo;make it long and comprehensive enough to be a good
        record of your work&rdquo;, we may infer that the learners&rsquo; role
        is to read the narrative and make such notes as will enable them to recall
        as closely as possible that narrative. The emphasis on using words and
        phrases from the extract is significant because it discourages learners
        from internalising the content, relating it to other knowledge or experiences
        and re-expressing it in their own terms. </p>
    <p>But
        learning activities don&rsquo;t have to be so prescriptive. AccessArt (<a href="../http://www.accessart.org.uk/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.accessart.org.uk/index.php</a>),
        an on-line learning resource for &ldquo;pupils, students, and lifelong
        learners as well as teachers, gallery educators and artists&rdquo; is
        a good example of how on-line resources can be used to support clear
        learning objectives without prescribing the precise outcomes. The on-line
        drawing workshop for 16+ learners encourages and supports exploration
        of, understanding of, seeing and drawing. Another good example is the
        set of learning &ldquo;challenges&rdquo; in the British Museum&rsquo;s Ancient
        Egypt Interactive
        learning Web site (see, for example, the temple challenge at <a href="../http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/temples/home.html" target="_blank">http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/temples/home.html</a>).
        In both cases the activities provided carefully &ldquo;scaffold&rdquo; the
        learning experience. </p>
    <p>As we
        know, learning is more than passive receipt of information. It entails &ldquo;active
        manipulation, assimilation and the application of information&rdquo; (Clarke
        2001: 6). The art of effective learning design is therefore to go beyond
        mere provision of information, or even of opportunities for interaction.
        It entails anticipating learner difficulties and devising activities
        that scaffold the learning while leaving the learners sufficient freedom
        to pursue their own ideas and methods.</p>
    <p>So rather
        than eliminating the need to specify predictive learning outcomes, the
        open-ended flexibility required of a museum learning activity requires
        the designer to construct a scaffold that supports a range of possible
        learning outcomes. This complexity makes it all the more important to
        be able to test predictively the performance of designs before too much
        investment has been made.</p>
    <h1>Conclusions</h1>
    <p>Most
        museum projects have some educational element (Clark 2001). (In
        2006, 87% of UK museum curators contributed to museum education [MLA
        2006]). Not surprisingly, museums are finding it increasingly
        important to provide access to and support for explicit learning activities
        via their Web sites. The high cost of developing quality Web sites means
        that Museum directors and Web designers alike need to be confident and
        able to assure others their designs represent a good return on investment.
        In the absence of reliable predictive methods, museums and Web designers
        are exposed to risk of censure or at least criticism for failing to make
        best use of their resources. User-centred design is an established methodology
        for producing Web sites that work well. But it relies on being able to
        specify in advance what the site should actually do. In a learning context,
        this means specifying the learning outcomes. While there has been some
        debate about how appropriate or feasible it is to specify predictive
        performance measures in the context of informal, adult learning, this
        paper has argued that clearly specifying what a particular Museum Web
        site design is intended to achieve in terms of learning outcomes does
        not limit its usability or relevance, and it is essential in order to
        ensure maximum return on investment in the design. Unambiguously specified
        designs can be tested iteratively during development to ensure that they
        are performing as required. Vaguely defined design goals that cannot
        be tested predictively leave Web developers and Museum managers exposed
        to the risk of failure.</p>
    <p>Emergent
        learning outcomes such as Generic Learning Outcomes are not practical
        metrics for formatively developing Web sites, therefore. Predictive learning
        outcomes are needed to support user-centred design. Prediction is not
        the same as prescription, and well-designed learning activities based
        on predictive learning outcomes need not result in learning activities
        that proscribe alternative uses. The advantage of predictive learning
        outcomes for designers is that they provide us with some kind of benchmark
        against which to test prototype designs before too much investment has
        been made. And, although large-scale field trials are possible, they
        are not necessary for user-centred design (Neilsen 1989). Satisfactory
        testing can be conducted with as few as three or four participants (Krug
        2000). So testing can be (and is best done) both early and frequently.</p>
