      <p class="abstractText">What impact does having an array of interpretive
          content - both analog and digital - have on the visitor experience?
          What kinds of interpretive content do museum visitors prefer to use?
          Which kinds of help do visitors appreciate in order to have meaningful
          experiences with complex works of art? Findings are presented from
          the 2006 Randi Korn &amp; Associates
        evaluation of interpretive media used in the <em>Matthew
        Barney: DRAWING RESTRAINT</em> exhibition, which included audio tours in three formats, an
        exhibition brochure, and an in-gallery 'Learning Lounge' with video,
        multimedia kiosk, books, and wall graphics.</p>
      <p class="abstractText">The device-independent audio tour was the result of a first-of-its-kind
        collaboration between SFMOMA, Antenna Audio, and Guide by Cell in which
        the same audio content (developed by Antenna) was presented on Antenna's
        Gallery Xplorer, available at no additional cost with the Museum's permanent
        collection tour; as a free podcast or download from the Museum's Web
        site; and finally, for those who had arrived in the disorienting landscape
        of Barney's sculptures without prior preparation, via just-in-time phone
        calls to Guide by Cell's server.</p>
      <p class="abstractText">The results of the Randi Korn study are detailed and augmented by statistics
        on usage patterns for the Barney Learning Lounge, which mixed analog

    <h1>1. Situation: The Matthew Barney Show</h1>
    <p >From June to September 2006, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)
      presented the exhibition <em>Matthew Barney: DRAWING RESTRAINT </em>in
      its expansive fourth floor galleries. Expansive is the operative word:
      skylights were bared, walls torn down, and the space opened up for the
      first time since the Museum&rsquo;s construction in 1994. Never had the
      Swiss grid of gallery cubes conceived by architect Mario Botta been so
      thoroughly gutted; coincidentally, never had the normal interpretive scaffolding
      typically offered by a museum been so utterly removed. The exhibition checklist
      contained relatively few items: apart the framed photographic film stills
      that lined the perimeter walls like a ribbon of conceptual celluloid, there
      were roughly a dozen large scale works in the 14,000 square foot landscape
      of gallery (Fig. 1a-c). Not one of these had an extended caption label.
      In fact, there was only one curatorial walltext for the entire floor: on
      the landing before the visitor entered the galleries. </p>

    <p >Barney aficionadoes find his work out-of-the-box inspiring; detractors
      find it hermetic, off-putting, even arrogant &ndash; and beyond the art
      world, most have still never heard of him. It was clear that a floor-wide
      installation of enormous objects from his latest venture, a film called <em>Drawing
      Restraint 9 </em>(<em>DR9</em>)<em> &ndash; </em>produced
      on a Japanese whaling ship at the request of a new museum in Kanazawa,
      Japan &ndash; would need some contextualization for the average art museum
      visitor. For in spite of the Antarctic theme of much of the imagery, the
      Museum did not intend to leave its visitors entirely out in the cold. A
      pervasive yet unobtrusive program of gallery interpretation would need
      to be developed as well. </p>
    <h1>2. Condition: The Interpretation Plan</h1>
    <p >It is not within the scope of this paper to deliver a sustained analysis
      or appraisal of Barney&rsquo;s controversial work. But our responsibility
      at the Museum was to provide museum visitors to this signal summer show
      with enough of a framework so that this landscape &ndash; comprised principally
      of enormous sculptures molded in white plastic or solidified petroleum
      jelly &ndash; would feel coherent, meaningful, even poetic. The approach
      we designed comprised both mobile and fixed components. </p>
    <h2>Mobile</h2>
    <p >To provide on-demand information as visitors moved through the galleries,
      we co-developed an audio tour with Antenna Audio; it was delivered through
      three channels, each with its own dedicated device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An Antenna Gallery Xplorer MP3 gallery guide,
        available at the atrium information desk on entering the Museum. This
        option was not free, but could be had at no surcharge when renting the
        $3 permanent collection audio tour.</li>
      <li>A podcast downloadable in advance from the SFMOMA
        Web site (<a href="../http://www.sfmoma.org/podcasts" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org/podcasts/</a>)</li>
      <li>Cell phone access in the galleries themselves,
        thanks to a trial arrangement with the San Francisco-based company, GuideByCell</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Fixed</h2>
    <p >Foreseeing the need for resources on the fourth floor gallery level,
      the Museum administration also reserved one small gallery to be transformed
      into a Barney Learning Lounge. In this space (Fig&rsquo;s 2a-c), both digital
      and analog media offered visitors multiple ways to access information,
      including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An interactive multimedia feature published using
        Pachyderm 2.0, delivered both at kiosks and over the Web (<a href="../http://www.sfmoma.org/barney" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org/barney</a>/)</li>
      <li>A video loop of Barney talking about his work,
        derived from an interview we had conducted, followed by the trailer for
        the <em>Drawing Restraint 9 </em>film. These played on a large plasma
        screen dead ahead as you entered, visible from the landing. The interview
        videos were also included in the interactive feature.</li>
      <li>Barney FAQ wall graphics, combining large-scale
        texts and images, engaged both walls of the Lounge. </li>
      <li>A brochure co-written by Curatorial, Education,
        and Publications staff, explaining the artist&rsquo;s cosmology in detail. </li>
      <li>Books on Barney, laid out on a shelf </li>
      <li>Comfortable stools for watching the plasma screen
        and consulting the resources lining the two walls</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="samis-fig2a.jpg" alt="View of the Matthew Barney Learning Lounge" width="400" height="300" /></p>

      Learning Lounge, from top to bottom: kiosks and FAQ wall graphics on left
      wall; plasma screen showing artist interview clips and trailer for <em>DR9 </em>film
      mounted on back wall; books and continuation of FAQ wall graphics on right
      wall. </p>
    <p>To evaluate the relative success of these components,
      as well as the introductory exhibition walltext, docent tours, and the <em>DR9 </em>film
      being screened daily in the ground floor theater, SFMOMA hired museum evaluation
      experts Randi Korn &amp; Associates. At an inter-departmental meeting prior
      to the exhibition&rsquo;s opening, goals were articulated for the exhibition,
      the interpretive media, and the evaluation itself. Among the goals listed:</p>
    <p>1. Visitors will perceive the exhibition as visually stimulating,
      enjoyable, enticing, stimulating, provocative, entertaining, educational.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visitors will experience the exhibition as a beautiful
        environment. </li>
      <li>Visitors will recognize that there are multiple
        ways to approach artwork in the exhibition&hellip;</li>
    </ul>
    <p >2. Interpretive media will: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>provide context for Mathew Barney&rsquo;s work
        and personal relevance to visitors </li>
      <li>provide an invitation for visitors to explore
        the exhibition </li>
      <li>motivate visitors to return to the museum, become
        members, and tell friends about the exhibition</li>
      <li>communicate to visitors that SFMOMA cares about
        them&hellip;</li>
    </ul>
    <p >3. The interpretive media evaluation will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>determine whether visitors perceive interpretive
        media as helpful in providing context for artwork</li>
      <li>identify demographics/psychographics of visitors&rsquo; preferences
        for various types of media</li>
      <li>determine whether informed audiences (visitors
        familiar with Barney&rsquo;s work) use interpretive media</li>
      <li>determine which interpretive media visitors use</li>
      <li>determine whether visitors perceive technology
        as cutting edge</li>
    </ul>
    <p >It was understood that a primary focus of the evaluation was on visitor
      preferences for one or another kind of audio tour delivery device; that
      said, the opportunity to simultaneously evaluate visitor responses to both
      the exhibition and the full range of interpretive media resources was not
      to be missed. With that in mind, the evaluation was designed in two parts: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>a set of oral interviews of visitors who had used
        one or another form of audio tour</li>
      <li>a written survey administered by two attendants
        hired specifically for the purpose, and conducted during two-week periods
        in July (when the Museum hosts many American tourists); August (when
        there are more foreign tourists); and September (when the audience once
        again becomes predominantly local). (While the results were not compared
        on a month-by-month basis, the feeling was that this would give a more
        representative sampling of our visitorship than lumping all the surveys
        into a shorter period) (Randi Korn).</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Audio Served Three Ways </h1>
    <p >The audio tour was kept to a modicum of ten stops, each reflecting a
      zone or major installation work in the exhibition. Antenna&rsquo;s sound
      engineer Peter Dunne designed a musical treatment to underscore the narrated
      texts, and excerpts from SFMOMA&rsquo;s Barney interview were liberally
      sprinkled throughout. Exhibition curator Benjamin Weil added his perspective,
      as did Nancy Spector, who had organized the Guggenheim&rsquo;s <em>Cremaster </em>retrospective
      three years before. During testing, the music track proved distracting
      on the cell phone tour, as the tinny mono phone speaker held up to the
      ear was already competing with ambient gallery noise: conversations, crowds,
      guards, and videos. This was not a problem with either the podcast or Gallery
      Xplorer, which were typically used with earbuds and headphones, respectively.
      Therefore, the music was suppressed on the cell phone tour; we also added
      the necessary administrative prompt: &ldquo;Enter another item number followed
      by the # sign, or you may hang up and call back later.&rdquo; Otherwise,
      the tours contained identical content.</p>
    <p >The cell phone tour benefited from an additional promotional push: cognizant
      that most visitors know cell phone use in museums is forbidden, we printed
      thousands of colorful info cards which were held in racks by the elevators,
      in the Learning Lounge, and at the gallery entrance (Fig&rsquo;s. 3a-b).
      These brightly advertised a &ldquo;FREE CELL PHONE AUDIO TOUR&rdquo; and
      clarified that there was &ldquo;No cost except for your minutes.&rdquo; The
      verso of the cards gave a full stop list with accompanying thumbnail images
      of the artworks each stop discussed. </p>
    <p >Finally, in rather small print, the revised rules of cell phone engagement
      for the purposes of this exhibition read as follows: </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Please refrain from cell-phone conversations, photography, and
      speakerphone use while in the galleries. Kindly set your phone to silent-ring
      mode.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="samis-fig3.jpg" alt="Barney Cell Phone Tour Promotional Card" width="384" height="396" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 3a-b<strong>:</strong> Barney cell phone tour promotional
    card, recto and verso.</p>
    <p>The podcast version of the tour was also offered free
      of charge, but visitors had to be enough of a Barney aficionado, or at
      least have thought sufficiently about their upcoming visit to SFMOMA, to
      have gone to <a href="../http://www.sfmoma.org/" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org</a> and
      downloaded it in advance. The podcast was accompanied by a downloadable
      PDF gallery map which showed the locations of the various stops (Fig. 4).</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="samis-fig4.jpg" alt="Fig 4: Matthew Barney exhibition podcast downloadable PDF tour map" width="400" height="304" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 4: Matthew Barney exhibition podcast downloadable
      PDF tour map</p>
    <p >As of this writing, Apple still has not implemented a synching strategy
      for visitors to download iPod tours at remote locations without threatening
      their own data; we viewed the cell phone tour as the personal device for
      those who had not planned in advance and yet desired interpretive enrichment
      just in time in the galleries.</p>
    <p >As for the standard issue Antenna Galley Xplorer, we offered it in tandem
      with our permanent collection audio tour at no added cost to keep the parallelism
      in place with the other two platforms. For logistical reasons, it was only
      offered (and hence promoted) in the atrium; the podcasts, for their part,
      were only promoted on the Web, and the cell phone tour was only promoted
      on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor. </p>
    <h1>3. Production: The Evaluation</h1>
    <p >What did we discover through the evaluation study? We knew that Barney&rsquo;s
      audience skews young, and 50% of respondents were in the 18&ndash;35 age
      range. (Interestingly, there was a higher survey refusal rate among older
      visitors. Were they insecure and afraid of being put on the spot about
      the show??)</p>
    <p >The majority (58%) were from California. Overall, the responding visitors
      rated their knowledge of modern art at 4.1: a hair above the midpoint on
      a 1-7 scale. But while they knew something about modern art, most knew
      virtually nothing about Barney: the median self-assessment was 1.0 on that
      same 1&ndash;7 scale! That said, the 22% familiar with Barney&rsquo;s art &ndash; a
      minority who self-rated between 4&ndash;7 &ndash; knew enough to raise
      the average (mean) level of familiarity to 2.3. In fact, familiar or un-,
      45% of respondents came to the Museum specifically to see this exhibition.
      A demographic breakdown of responding visitors is presented in Fig. 5.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="samis-fig5.png" alt="Fig 5: Demographic overview of visitors responding to survey" width="333" height="378" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 5<strong>:</strong> Demographic overview of visitors
      responding to survey</p>
    <p >Having established visitors&rsquo; level of familiarity with modern art
      in general and Matthew Barney in particular, the survey went on to assess
      visitor use of interpretive resources. Traditional interpretive media such
      as the introductory wall text and brochure are still far and away the most
      consulted resources; in other words, our visitors know the protocols of
      how to visit a museum! But there is a discrepancy between how frequently
      these resources were consulted and how helpful they were in helping visitors
      appreciate Barney&rsquo;s art. The gap between quantity of use and value
      delivered is wide. (See Fig&rsquo;s 6 and 7 below.)</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="samis-fig6.png" alt="Fig 6: Use of interpretive offerings by visitors (%)" width="313" height="166" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 6<strong>:</strong> Use of interpretive offerings
      by visitors (%)</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="samis-fig7.png" alt="Fig 7: Visitors&rsquo; ratings of value of interpretive offerings (on a 1&ndash;7 scale)" width="416" height="175" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 7: Visitors&rsquo; ratings of value of interpretive
      offerings (on a 1&ndash;7 scale)</p>
    <p>So while everyone knows you start an exhibition by
      reading the introductory wall text, recent research has shown that the
      value of these grand overviews is minimal. They are a rhetorical mode that
      addresses high concepts which visitors don&rsquo;t yet have visual references
      to anchor. In the case of the Barney show, 78% of respondents had read
      the text, and yet its value was rated a meager 4.7 on a scale of 1&ndash;7,
      last on the list of interpretive resources. (Note, for example, the Detroit
      Institute of Art&rsquo;s recommendations to forego introductory walltexts
      in favor of &lsquo;advance organizers,&rsquo; panels that briefly explain
      the importance of the show and include a map of the exhibition&rsquo;s
      thematic zones. The theory is that few if any will retain the theoretical
      points made before they are in the presence of the actual artworks. Once
      the visitors are in the exhibition proper, section panels introduce the
      themes relevant to the specific works around them. [DIA 2002]) Similarly,
      the brochure, which was full of information, was used by 55% of respondents;
      yet one can wonder how many actually had the opportunity to consult it
      in the gallery during their visit.</p>
    <p >In terms of interpretive payoff, the most highly rated resources were,
      interestingly enough, the cell phone tour and the podcast, which both earned
      6.2 out of 7 possible points. I, for one, find this fascinating. For these
      are the two technologies that map most closely to the younger demographic &ndash; the
      very same demographic that typically steers clear of headset audio tours!
      The fact that the content on these tours was identical to the headset tours
      would seem to indicate that Device Is Everything &ndash; especially when
      it comes to younger viewers. </p>
    <p >This extrapolation is borne out by a question in the SFMOMA survey asking
      visitors to select their top two reasons for selecting their device (Fig
      8). </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="samis-fig8.png" alt="Fig 8: Reasons for selecting an audio tour by device" width="437" height="223" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 8: Reasons for selecting an audio tour by device</p>
    <p >Across the board, familiarity and comfort with the device and being able
      to access information as needed are common themes. But different age groups
      are &ldquo;familiar and comfortable&rdquo; with different devices! In fact,
      the determining factors for younger museum-goers seem to be: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I prefer to use my own device rather than renting</li>
      <li>It was cheaper or free</li>
    </ul>
    <p >An age:device correlation, while not deemed statistically significant,
      was clearly indicated in the Korn study, where 61% of the under 35 age
      group chose to use their iPod or cell phone.</p>
    <p >This data correlates squarely with Antenna&rsquo;s <em>Global Visitor
        Survey</em>, compiled and released in late 2006 (Antenna). It appears
        that while veteran museum-goers over forty may be comfortable taking
        headset audio tours and paying a supplement for them, their children
        and grandchildren may not. In the Antenna study, close to half the visitors
        surveyed aged 18&ndash;34 said a lower price point &ndash; especially
        when combined with special interest in the subject matter &ndash; might
        prompt them to take an audio guide. The same study found that two-thirds
        of visitors in this age group owned MP3 players, and 79% of them would
        consider downloading an audio guide program to their own device. Do we
        have a critical mass here? </p>
    <p >Maybe. It now appears clear that many in the younger demographic <em>don&rsquo;t </em>want
      to pay to take what is perceived as &ldquo;their parents&rsquo; audio tour&rdquo; &ndash; at
      least on their parents&rsquo; audio device. Witness the 83% of SFMOMA podcast
      users who were aware of the audio guide headset option but chose not to
      use it, and the 52% of cell phone tour users who felt the same way (Fig.
      9). That said, it is not yet clear whether these same visitors will show
      up for tours on their own devices in large numbers. First indications are
      promising, but as yet inconclusive.</p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 9: Awareness of audio alternatives among those
      who chose a device</p>
    <p >For while the statistics from the Korn survey imply that as many as 47%
      of Barney exhibition visitors may have availed themselves of an audio option,
      an internal audit of counts of audio guide sales, unique phone numbers
      calling the Guide by Cell server, and podcast downloads implies a far lower
      number. It appears that traditional media &ndash; read: walltexts, brochures,
      and films or videos &ndash; consistently trump all our new media <em>mishigas</em>,
      at least in terms of use habits. That does not mean the old media <em>work</em> better &ndash; Figure
      10 gives the lie to that; only that museum-visitors are by-and-large an
      educated, highly literate crowd who feel comfortable with text and have
      learned to use it over long years of gallery-going practice. Our kiosks,
      touchscreens, PDAs, and podcasts still appeal to a distinct minority of
      our total visitors. </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="samis-fig10.png" width="456" height="341" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 10<strong>:</strong> Comparison of usage and perceived
      value of interpretive resources</p>
    <p >Data supplied by GuideByCell enabled us to further differentiate the
      cell phone experience from that of podcast and audio tour users. Cell phone
      users who had not planned to take a tour prior to arriving on the gallery
      level seemed to adopt an &agrave; la carte, or &ldquo;cafeteria&rdquo; approach
      to audio use. The tour was free, so they reached for their phones for information
      on demand. There was no compunction to take the whole tour. The Korn survey
      respondents self-reported listening to an average of 6 stops out of 10
      on their cell phones, and the Guide by Cell server logs put the average
      at just under five. This contrasts with the typical headset audio tour
      behavior in a special exhibition, where the purchaser is conscious of buying
      a complete immersive experience. It remains to be seen where free iPod
      tours fall in this spectrum, although since the visitors have gone to the
      trouble of downloading them in advance and have the advantage of immersive
      earbuds that provide far richer audio quality than the phone users get,
      it is probable they see it as a custom experience they want to enjoy fully. </p>
    <h1 style="page-break-after:auto;">Mixin&rsquo; It Up in the Learning Lounge</h1>
    <p >After the introductory wall text and the exhibition brochure, the Barney
      Learning Lounge as an aggregate was the most consulted resource; more people
      used it than the audio tours, docent tours, or Web site. A mix of analog
      and digital, the space comprised widescreen video, large scale wall graphics,
      books, multimedia &ndash; and lots of seating. (As with so many contemporary
      art spaces, seating was virtually non-existent elsewhere.) Visitors loved
      seeing the artist talk: his thoughtful formulations of ideas infused the
      recondite landscape of large scale objects outside with a kind of out-of-the-box
      reason eliciting, &ldquo;I never thought of that before&rdquo; responses.
      SFMOMA director Neal Benezra is fond of recalling a moment when he witnessed
      three elderly women with walkers all nodding with appreciation as Matthew
      described his processes and concerns. They were <em>getting it</em>. As
      the MasterCardcommercial says: <em>Priceless. </em> </p>
    <p >At first, the video played all the time. It so dominated the room that
      no one could do anything but watch. Adjustments were made to the timing:
      we inserted a 10-minute interval between screenings with an onscreen countdown &ndash; an
      image that changed once a minute. This freed the room up for other activities:
      reading the FAQs graphically displayed across the walls, immersing oneself
      in a kiosk or a book, or just talking with a friend. After this fine tuning,
      the popularity of resources with visitors ran in the following order: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>FAQ wall graphics</li>
      <li>Artist Video Interview on plasma screen </li>
      <li>Computer kiosks with interactive feature</li>
      <li>Books on the artist</li>
    </ol>
    <p >But visitors did not just use a single resource. They browsed, they grazed&hellip; and
      sometimes they dived in. Knowing from the countdown when the video would
      begin gave them an opportunity to either go back into the gallery or examine
      the other interpretive resources. Sometimes by the time the video came
      on, they were so immersed in a kiosk or a book that they ignored the program.
      But let&rsquo;s not delude ourselves: widescreen video of the artist on
      a plasma screen trumps all. </p>
    <p >The Randi Korn study reveals some interesting unseen patterns behind
      these observable behaviors, most notably: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the large number of visitors who used multiple
        interpretive offerings</li>
      <li>the tendency of people already familiar with Matthew
        Barney to use more interpretive resources than those who knew nothing
        about him</li>
      <li>the increase in exhibition ratings by respondents
        unfamiliar with Barney&rsquo;s art who used multiple interpretive offerings </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="samis-fig11.png" alt="Fig 11: Rating of Matthew Barney: DRAWING RESTRAINT exhibition by a) # of interpretive offerings used and b) prior familiarity with Barney&rsquo;s art " width="468" height="459" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 11: Rating of Matthew Barney: DRAWING RESTRAINT
      exhibition by a) # of interpretive offerings used and b) prior familiarity
      with Barney&rsquo;s art </p>
    <p >Figure 11 shows the discrepancy between those arriving in the galleries
      already familiar with Barney and his work and those who have had no prior
      exposure; furthermore, it tracks members of these two groups as they use
      more and more interpretive offerings. Let&rsquo;s call them <em>initiates</em> and <em>non-initiates</em>,
      with full cognizance of the &lsquo;art world insider&rsquo; implications
      of those terms. Non-initiates who did not avail themselves of any resources
      left the show feeling ripped off. They rated it 2.6 out of 7, and their
      comments were on the order of, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; &ldquo;&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t
      bother,&rdquo; &ldquo;Waste of brain cells,&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      good for the loony people who like things that look like garbage on a polished
      wood floor.&rdquo; But as soon as they used even one or two resources,
      their rating of the exhibition as a whole rose significantly, to an attitudinally
      neutral 4. They saw that something intelligent was going on that they could
      respect, even if they didn&rsquo;t fully get it or connect. Their comments
      were more on the order of, &ldquo;Due to lack of comprehension/ meaning/purpose
      of the work I was a little lost&rdquo; or &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t listened
      to the audio tour yet so I don&rsquo;t really feel I get it all but I know
      that if I put effort into it, it would become more meaningful.&rdquo; There
      is the sense of a cosmos in these remarks, of something to understand. </p>
    <p >As these uninitiated visitors used three or four resources, they <em>got
        initiated.</em> A cognitive psychologist would say they got scaffolding.
        That doesn&rsquo;t mean they came away liking everything they saw, but
        their exhibition rating rose commensurately, to 4.6. By the time they
        used five-plus resources, they were immersed in Barney&rsquo;s mythic
        world, and rated the exhibition at 5.4, a level of stimulated satisfaction.
        They made comments like: &ldquo;A great experience to learn more about
        the artist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do the free cell phone tour &ndash; it gives
        good context and you get to hear from the artist.&rdquo; The net gain
        with interpretive offerings was from 2.6 to 5.4 &ndash; more than doubling
        of the rating, and more importantly, an index of real engagement. (Of
        course with Barney fans, the gain is smaller &ndash; from 5.6 to 6.1 &ndash; but
        the numbers who use multiple offerings are significant.) </p>
    <p >In the final analysis, the presence of multiple interpretive resources,
      including free audio options, was noticed by some visitors and appreciated:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">It is very accessible. [SFMOMA is] willing to
      get the information to everyone however they want it. If [visitors] don&rsquo;t
      want to pay, then there are other ways [to get the information]. It seemed
      very open-minded and cool.</p>
    <p >One person said that once. When more of our visitors say that all the
      time, we&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;re doing the right thing. </p>
    <h1>Conclusions</h1>
    <p >What are the takeaways from this experience/experiment and research? </p>
    <ol>
      <li>In terms of mobile audio, different audiences prefer different devices.
        No single option clearly trumps all. Younger audiences seem to favor
        using their personal devices, be they iPods or cell phones; older audiences
        are more likely to rent standard headset audio guides, but they may also
        use their cell phones. </li>
      <li>Cell phone tour users seem to take a more &agrave; la
        carte approach to listening, while people who pay for standard headset
        audio tours are more likely to listen to the majority or all of the stops.</li>
      <li>In terms of sheer numbers, traditional interpretive
        media such as wall texts and object labels are the foundation on which
        visitor experience is built. Digital or electronic media acts as a supplement,
        used by a minority of the visitors. </li>
      <li>The most effective interpretation strategy is
        born from a mix of the analog and the digital, providing visitors with
        a menu of diverse yet complementary offerings.<strong></strong></li>
      <li>Visitors love videos of the artist, but a video
        that plays all the time overpowers other quieter forms of interpretive
        resources nearby. </li>
      <li>Those conversant with an artist&rsquo;s work may
        be more enthusiastic in their use of interpretive resources than those
        who have never heard of the artist before. </li>
      <li>For those unfamiliar with a contemporary artist&rsquo;s
        work, presence of interpretive resources may make the difference between
        alienation and engagement.</li>
      <li>Use of a greater number of interpretive resources
        correlates directly with enhanced meaning-making, greater appreciation
        of the artist, the exhibition, and the museum experience.</li>
