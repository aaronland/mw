    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The legal protection of natural areas should be relevant to the general
      public. This is a basic principle of paramount importance in order to reach
      the ideal of actual preservation. Ordinary people need to make sense of
      what these wildlife environments really mean to themselves and hence to
      the rest of the natural and non-natural environments. Among the general
      public there are subsets of stakeholders at different levels of involvement,
      and other groups that are target audiences so they will become stakeholders
      (we hope).&nbsp; Among the latter group we have a large audience of fifth
      and sixth graders at elementary schools who are the target audience for
      the development of this Web site which is designed to fulfill their information
      needs. </p>
    <p>In the state of Jalisco there are several natural protected areas created
      by federal or state decree, or by county declaration. However, research
      conducted by members our team&nbsp; provide evidence that the general public
      reports having very little to no knowledge about the existence of the legal
      protection, or the utility and benefits of such protection (Ram&iacute;rez &amp; Posadas,
      2004; Ram&iacute;rez &amp; Brito, 2006; Ram&iacute;rez, Carrillo, Brito,
      P&eacute;rez &amp; Posadas, 2006; Ram&iacute;rez, Mayorga, Carrillo, Posadas,
      P&eacute;rez &amp; Brito, 2007). Basic information is considered, reporting
      whether they know the land is in a natural protection area. If respondents
      indicate knowledge of the protection, then they are asked about the category
      or the type of protected land. The types of possible protected land in
      Mexico are identified in the <em>Ley General del Equilibrio Ecol&oacute;gico
      y Protecci&oacute;n al Ambiente </em>(Environment and Ecology General Law).
      In Jalisco there are national parks, forest and wildlife protection, hydrological
      protected land, and biosphere reserve. Another common question we have
      asked is whether they know the size of the public space under such type
      of protection. </p>
    <p>According to the above-mentioned law (Art. 45), the establishment of natural
      protected areas has the main objective of preserving natural environments
      that represent the ecosystems; preserving genetic diversity; ensuring the
      sustainable use of the ecosystems; providing ground for scientific research;
      providing, retaining and diffusing knowledge that allows the preservation
      and sustainable use of the biodiversity; and protecting natural, touristy
      and recreational environments. Here is the where the Website that we are
      presenting aims to contribute, by building a bridge between the general
      public, experts, and stakeholders. </p>
    <p>Besides the poor knowledge base the public report, they report that the
      forested areas to them are mainly a scenic and landscape resource. Another
      large set of responses indicates that forested areas represent a source
      of fresh air. We need to read between the lines of the responses. Respondents
      reporting seeing almost no relationship between the presence of a forest
      and its association with water. </p>
    <p>We have developed several survey projects in the state of Jalisco since
      1994, and the results are consistent. Common citizens are &ldquo;water-blind&rdquo; when
      they see the forests in the protected areas of Jalisco, as well as in other
      recreational areas (whether they are currently under the process of legal
      protection, or not (Ram&iacute;rez, Posadas &amp; Anaya, 2006).) When we
      are talking about land not under the process of legal protection, we are
      considering city or urban parks that should be considered among Natural
      Protected Area County System (Sistema Municipal de &Aacute;reas Naturales
      Protegidas). This is part of a strategy to focus attention on the development
      of Management Plans for the preservation of public parks in the cities
      of the state of Jalisco. The Management Plans include strict determination
      of the parks limits. There exists a need to attract general public attention
      to these parks due to consistent encroachment of the green areas in the
      cities.</p>
    <p><em>Environmental perceptions</em> are considered in this paper to be
      the worldviews of the people regarding their natural environment. Considering
      these pieces of research evidence, an intervention should be developed
      to better inform the general audience about the wealth of resources the
      natural environment still holds, did hold, or should be developing and
      preserving for future generations. The Web site is only one part of a strategy
      to overcome public knowledge deficits and to support other parts of the
      strategy where we have projects for community-based action. The Website
      would contribute to citizens having a larger view of their own world.</p>
    <p>Efforts to document environmental perceptions in M&eacute;xico have been
      pursued by several authors. Hern&aacute;ndez (2006) documented perceptions
      of elementary school students about the tropical forests in M&eacute;xico,
      and Lobo (2005) documented perceptions about the desert. Others have documented
      perceptions about the mountains and city parks. </p>
    <p>In this paper we discuss a work in progress:&nbsp; the development of
      a Web site. </p>
    <h1>Our Web Site</h1>
    <p>Designing he site has been guided mainly by what students in undergraduate
      school in biology found in interviews conducted among residents of natural
      protected areas. The focus of the topics is on what students in fifth and
      sixth grades want and need&nbsp; to know, what they already know, and their
      level of comprehension. Their knowledge base is the starting point.</p>
    <p>A working assumption is that the educational materials designed and developed
      for this level would be a good level of information for the general public.
      The site is advertised for the general public to use, learn, and find entertainment
      regarding the protected areas of Jalisco. </p>
    <p>Another working assumption is that if people learn more about natural
      protected areas,&nbsp; they are more likely to visit recreational areas
      that have facilities to use these areas as a source of entertainment. This
      would increase both their appreciation of nature and the quality of their
      leisure time: more exercise, better lifestyles.</p>
    <p>Previous experience has shown that even though computer ownership is not
      very high in Mexico, or in Jalisco for that matter, providing opportunities
      on the Web to get information about parks is an idea welcomed by specialists
      and non-specialists. Journal articles, TV-news, as well as school teachers
      and common people have reported good use of the Web site &ldquo;guadalajaraparks.udg.mx&rdquo; launched
      in 2003 by one of the authors of this paper. This new Web site is being
      developed with similar objectives in mind. </p>
    <p>In the new Web site we keep in mind how knowledge and perceptions are
      processed to make sense to young students. So as users develop questions,
      the intention is to answer them on the Web site, trying to contextualize
      the whole situation. </p>
    <h1>Recreation, A Driving Force For The Web Site</h1>
    <p>Using the topic of recreation proposed by Manning (2005) in the outline
      of his book <em>Studies in Outdoor Recreation: search and research for
      satisfaction,</em> the research topics focus on practical issues to guide
      new research questions. </p>
    <p>The research topics discussed in the Q&amp;A&rsquo;s will be as follows:
      social aspects of outdoor recreation: use and users; descriptive aspects
      of outdoor recreation: attitudes, preferences, and perceptions; carrying
      capacity: (focusing in both landscapes and soundscapes); crowding: use
      level, perceived crowding, and satisfaction; indicators and standards of
      quality; motivations and benefits in recreation (behavioral); the recreation
      opportunity spectrum; recreation conflict; substitutability: alternative
      recreation opportunities; management issues; principles and practices of
      outdoor recreation.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Using a Web site to bring together students, park users, park managers,
      park dwellers, and university professors has been a rewarding experience
      in previous projects, as well as the current one discussed in this demonstration
      and paper. The Internet provides unexplored opportunities to develop skills
      and creative resources to engage students in building the Web site. Developing
      the site involves users who do actually go to the parks, as well as potential
      visitors. Another way the Web site serves its users is just by providing
      information, as a public relations venture, about what we are doing, what
      we have, and what we ought to preserve for future generations. </p>
