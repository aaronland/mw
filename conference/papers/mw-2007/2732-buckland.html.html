				  <h1>Introduction</h1>			
				  <p>Most well edited resources have some kind of indexing
				    or categorization, but the &ldquo;vocabularies&rdquo; of categories,
				    codes, and terms used vary widely and can be quite complex. In practice,
				    efficient effective searching and selection requires some familiarity
				    with whatever vocabulary is being used. </p>
				  <p>The Web increases the number and variety of resources
				    that are accessible, but which are more or less difficult to search effectively
				    because their vocabularies are unfamiliar. Since the manner in which
				    remote resources are provided is beyond one&rsquo;s control, the practical
				    challenge is to find ways to support effective remote use. </p>
				  <p>We have been engaged in a series of studies of the
				    issues to be addressed, specifically, mapping from familiar to unfamiliar
				    vocabularies (Buckland, Chen, Chen &amp; others, 1999), the inherent
				    problems of searching across and between different media types (e.g.
				    text, images, sound, and numeric data series) (Buckland, Gey &amp; Larson,
				    2002; Buckland, Chen, Gey &amp; others, 2007), improved geographic search
				    (Buckland, Gey &amp; Larson 2004; Buckland, Chen, Gey &amp; Larson, 2006),
				    time period directories (Petras, Larson &amp; Buckland, 2006), search
				    by time, place, topic, and person (Buckland &amp; Lancaster, 2004; 2006),
				    and, currently, biographical text (<em>Bringing</em>,
				    2006).</p>
				  <p>Underlying this work is the importance of context.
				    The difference between mere memorizing and understanding is that to understand
				    anything you need to know about the context: the who, what, where, when,
				    why, and how of whatever it is. So, for the learner, whether a student,
				    teacher, or curator, the ability to search for related contextualizing
				    resources is important. </p>
				  <h1>Museum Objects and the Search for Context</h1>
				  <p>Ordinarily, search support involves accepting a textual
				    query and matching it against a collection of text resources, either
				    textual documents or textual metadata representing other kinds of objects.
				    In information retrieval theory it is accepted that a document can be
				    used as a query. Any search system that can accept a textual query will
				    not know or care whether the query is a newly-formed query or a fragment
				    (or even the entirety) of a pre-existing text document. A function that
				    is sometimes explicitly provided is a &ldquo;nearest neighbor&rdquo; search:
				    What other document(s) most closely resemble this one?</p>
				  <p>Another important principle in documentation theory
				    is that any object considered to be signifying something can be considered
				    a &ldquo;document&rdquo;, and from about 1930, European documentalists
				    considered museum objects to be documents just as much as books and images
				    (Buckland, 1997). In her manifesto of 1951, now finally available in
				    English, Suzanne Briet (1951, 7; 2006, 10) explained that if a stone
				    in a mineralogical museum or a captive antelope in a zoo is examined
				    as evidence, it has become as much a &ldquo;document&rdquo; as a book
				    or a journal article. Birger Hj&oslash;rland (1997, 111) added that a
				    stone, like any other document, would mean different things to different
				    people, according to their interests and perspectives, and Geoffrey Bowker
				    puts it nicely: Stones lead a double life. On the one hand they just
				    do what rocks do, ordinarily just sitting on or in the ground, but, when
				    examined, they reveal the history of the earth (Bowker, 2005, 36). In
				    other words, for informational and educational purposes it is inappropriate
				    to restrict the notion of a &ldquo;document&rdquo; to only printed or
				    textual objects. In this view, a museum object is, functionally, as a
				    much a &ldquo;document&rdquo; as a text, an image, or a digital file.
				    There may be technical difficulties in matching, say, biological specimens
				    or material culture with related items in dissimilar forms, such as books,
				    photographs, numeric data series, and sound recordings, but that is exactly
				    what is needed to discover and select contextualizing resources.</p>
				  <p>In a recent project, we took contextualizing as design
				    goal, with two applications in mind. One challenge was to consider K-12
				    history and social science teaching and to ask what kind of search support
				    would enable a teacher to find additional resources explaining the background
				    on any topic, person, institution, or event mentioned in the assigned
				    textbook. The other challenge was museum-related: Suppose one selected
				    a museum at random and then, from its collections, picked an object at
				    random, what kind of search support would facilitate discovering contextualizing
				    resources in other institutions&rsquo; collections? What other objects
				    like it can be identified elsewhere in archives, databases, libraries,
				    or museums? What else is known to come from the same place and time or
				    has the same purpose? What literature, archival records, images, sound
				    recordings, or other documents relate to it specifically or, more generally,
				    to the kind of object it is? Our assumption was that this kind of inquiry
				    is an important part of what museum curators do, so the task was to investigate
				    what courses of action might make the apparatus of metadata, search engines,
				    and interoperability more supportive of their efforts.</p>
				  <p>Our project, entitled &ldquo;Support for the Learner:
				    What, Where, When and Who,&rdquo; built directly on our earlier work
				    and was supported in part by a grant from the Institute of Museum and
				    Library Services for the period October 2004 through December 2006. It
				    became apparent early in the project that the two design challenges were
				    too ambitious for the time and resources available. Nevertheless, they
				    remained inspirational while we worked on more elementary steps that,
				    we thought, would help to build the bases for eventually addressing these
				    challenges in a practical way. The rest of this paper summarizes what
				    we learned and what we recommend in terms of new techniques and improved &ldquo;best
				    practices&rdquo; that could move us all closer to achieving success with
				    these two design challenges.</p>
				  <h1>Recommendations for Innovation and Best Practices</h1>
				  <h2>WHAT &ndash; Mapping between vocabularies.</h2>
				  <p>It is widely understood and accepted that the inherent
				    ambiguity and instability of language needs to be &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; in
				    indexes, so, for example, synonyms should be explicitly related
				    and hierarchical and other relationships indicated. However, in a Web
				    environment multiple resources use quite different metadata vocabularies:
				    mapping between related terms in <em>different</em> vocabularies
				    becomes very important, but has received relatively little
				    attention. Manually relating the terms in two or more vocabularies becomes
				    extremely labor-intensive as well as inherently obsolescent as each vocabulary
				    evolves. There are, however, techniques using statistical association
				    and natural language processing which can generate inexpensive mappings
				    if a corpus of records is available as a training set (Buckland, Chen,
				    Chen &amp; others,
				    1999; Buckland, Gey &amp; Larson, 2002; Buckland, Chen, Gey &amp; others,
				    2006).&nbsp; </p>
				  <h2>WHERE &ndash; Place, space, and gazetteers</h2>
				  <p>Place names are notoriously ambiguous, multiple, unstable,
				    and/or vague, but improved &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; could substantially
				    improve support for geographical searching. It is useful to distinguish <em>place</em>,
				    a cultural concept, from <em>space</em>,
				    a physical construct. Place name gazetteers are best known from their
				    appearance as large pages of small type at the back of atlases, where
				    they also serve as indexes to the maps. But gazetteers exist in their
				    own right as, in effect, bilingual dictionaries linking places and spaces.
				    The importance of gazetteers is that they allow named places to be located
				    (or represented) on a map (Hill, 2006).</p>
				  <p>Museums and others who deal with historical material
				    have the additional problem that the common practice of using the names
				    and boundaries of today&rsquo;s political jurisdictions may make little
				    sense when dealing with past times. Support for geographic search could
				    be improved if a few additional steps were taken:</p>
				  <ol>
				    <li> Authority
				      lists of place names, as found in libraries, should either
				      have geographical coordinates added (latitude and longitude),
				      effectively making them into gazetteers, or, better, be linked to authoritative
				      gazetteers maintained elsewhere.</li>
				    <li>Gazetteer
				      entries should (but rarely do) include an indication of <em>when</em> that
				      name was in use;</li>
				    <li>Now
				      that catalogs are no longer made and presented in card
				      form, but by computer interface, there is no reason not
				      to provide map interfaces. The geographical distribution of retrieved
				      records can be shown as an aid to a more refined selection. Also, drawing
				      a region of interest on a map interface is a convenient way of expressing
				      the geographical scope of a search: find all ceramic items
				      in the collection from <em>this area</em>. </li>
				    <li>Understanding
				      and explaining change over time is important for museums.
				      Maps on paper have limited ability to show chronological
				      changes. But digital maps can show changes over time dynamically (Zerneke,
				      Buckland &amp; Carl,
				      2006). </li>
				    <li>Gazetteer
				      entries use geographical description codes (aka Feature
				      types) to indicate the kind of place named: Castle, lighthouse,
				      lake, city, etc. These feature type codes can be linked with corresponding
				      subject headings. Comparison of the National Geo-intelligence
				      Agency&rsquo;s Geographical Description
				      Codes (GDC) with Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) reveals
				      differences in style, emphasis, scope, and scale. Nevertheless, in most
				      cases there are sensible matches. For example, the NGA code &ldquo;School&rdquo; means
				      a school building, and corresponds to LCSH &ldquo;School buildings&rdquo; (for
				      the physical feature) and to LCSH &ldquo;Schools&rdquo; (for schools
				      as institutions). Mapping between these two vocabularies
				      allows one to move from the literature on, say, the <em>topic of lighthouses</em> to
				      locating (through a gazetteer and a map) <em>instances of lighthouses</em> on
				      the ground. Moving in the other direction, if you find
				      an actual lighthouse, you could search for literature about that particular
				      lighthouse, lighthouses in that region, or lighthouses generally.&nbsp; </li>
			    </ol>
				  <h2>WHEN &ndash; Use of events to denote time</h2>
				  <p>Clocks and calendars provide the obvious way to measure
				    and record time, but in both speech and writing, events, rather than
				    calendar dates, are widely used to denote points or periods of time.
				    The events are commonly wars (&ldquo;Civil war,&rdquo; &ldquo;World War
				    II&rdquo;), reigns, dynasties, and administrations (&ldquo;a Louis XIV
				    clock,&rdquo; &ldquo;under Clinton&rdquo;), cataclysmic events (&ldquo;after
				    the Lisbon earthquake&rdquo;) or personal (&ldquo;after graduation&rdquo;).
				    This use of events to denote time tends to be situational, multiple,
				    ambiguous, and unstable. A &ldquo;civil war weapon&rdquo; would date
				    from the seventeenth century in England or the twentieth century in Spain. &ldquo;The
				    Great War&rdquo; was renamed the &ldquo;First World War&rdquo; and, in
				    some quarters, the Vietnam War is coyly referred to as the Vietnamese
				    Conflict. These characteristics resemble those of place names, so we
				    developed an analogous solution: a named time period directory modeled
				    on the design of place name gazetteers (Petras, Larson &amp; Buckland,
				    2006). For each named period, a code for type of period (war, dynasty,
				    cataclysm, etc.), corresponding calendar dates, and, just as a gazetteer
				    should specify when a name was in use, a time period should indicate
				    the geographical context, thus:</p>
				  <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Place name gazetteer </em></p>
				  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Place
				      name&mdash;Type-&ndash;Geographical markers (lat. &amp; long)--When
				      in use</p>
				  <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Named period directory</em></p>
				  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Name
				      of period&mdash;Type&mdash;Chronological markers (calendar)&mdash;Where
				      used</p>
				  <p>The geographical markers of latitude and longitude
				    supplied in the gazetteer not only allow individual places to be located
				    on a map, but they also allow places named to be related to each other
				    geospatially (near, between, outside, south of, etc.). Correspondingly,
				    relating each named period to the chronological markers (calendar dates)
				    allows events to be positioned on a time line or in a chronology, and
				    thereby temporal relationships can be identified: What else happened
				    during this period? The inclusion of <em>both</em> place
				    and time aspects in <em>both</em> gazetteers
				    and time period directories allows geo-temporal relationships. What else
				    was near this place around that time? Descriptive metadata systems can
				    be seen as a form of infrastructure, and these kinds of links facilitate
				    the construction of metadata infrastructures (Buckland, 2006).</p>
				  <h2>WHO &ndash; Names and activities</h2>
				  <p>The desirability of disambiguating different persons
				    with the same name and of connecting different names for the same person
				    is well understood and widely implemented. In contrast, although biographical
				    text is important in many contexts, the standards and best practices
				    for representing what people do and the events in people&rsquo;s lives
				    are seriously inadequate. (For a useful survey, see Text Encoding Initiative
				    Consortium (2006)).</p>
				  <p>In current work we are examining the feasibility of
				    representing the individual&rsquo;s activities by expressing life activities
				    as a set of separate activities or events, in whatever level of detail
				    is desired, and then encoding each activity as a 4W-tuple of <em>what</em> kind
				    of activity, <em>where</em> it
				    took place, <em>when</em> and
				    for how long it occurred, and <em>who</em> else
				    was involved. The hope is that this approach could be generally acceptable
				    across different communities and that the vocabularies already established
				    within each community could be used to express <em>what</em> (topical
				    subject headings), <em>where</em> (place
				    name gazetteers), <em>when</em> (named
				    time period directories), and <em>who</em> (name
				    authority files and biographical dictionaries). If it is successful,
				    the basis for a great deal of interoperability within and between communities
				    could emerge. </p>
				  <h1>Search Support</h1>
				  <p>So far we have been concerned with improvements in
				    description. Searching can also be facilitated. </p>
				  <p>Mark-up commonly incorporates embedded links to related
				    sources which provide further explanation or validation. At best, these
				    links are obsolescent as newer publications appear. An alternative is
				    to provide a dynamic link in the form of a search query. As an example, <em>ECAI
				    Iraq</em> (<a href="../http://ecai.org/iraq/" target="_blank">http://ecai.org/iraq/</a>),
				    a temporal-spatial portal into existing digital resources about the history,
				    cultural sites, archaeological excavations, and heritage preservation
				    initiatives relating to Iraq, contains a series of Web pages for individual
				    historic sites (Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative, 2003). Clicking
				    on the first three links on each site page automatically generates search
				    queries, using the Z39:50 search and retrieve protocol, for material
				    concerning the site in the library catalogues of the University of California,
				    the research libraries of the United Kingdom, and the Library of Congress.
				    The merit of this approach is that the material retrieved will be as
				    up-to-date as those libraries&rsquo; cataloguing rather than entries
				    from a static, obsolescing bibliography. </p>
				  <p>The hierarchical structures of URLs are usually opaque
				    and of little meaning, but clearly structured URLs can greatly simplify
				    searching from remote locations. The Timeline of the Art History section
				    of the Metropolitan Museum Web site (<a href="../http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/" target="_blank">http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/</a>)
				    is an excellent example of helpful design. This section uses eleven defined
				    time periods (from &ldquo;20,000-8,000 BC&rdquo; through &ldquo;1900
				    AD &ndash; present&rdquo;) and, for places, a hierarchical structure
				    starting with nine major regions. Each time period and each geographical
				    area has a simple, easily-discerned code, clearly visible in the /toah
				    URLs. These codes can be mapped to the categories for time and place
				    in any local system and inserted algorithmically into a link. If one
				    were interested in the art of southern India during in the eighth century
				    CE and knew that it would be categorized at the Met Web site by &ldquo;06&rdquo; for
				    the time period 500-1,000 AD and &ldquo;sss&rdquo; for South South Asia,
				    one can insert &ldquo;sss&rdquo; and &ldquo;06&rdquo; into the /toah
				    URL extensions to form <a href="../http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/06/sss/ht06sss.htm" target="_blank">http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/06/sss/ht06sss.htm</a>,
				    which, <em>for this topic</em>, is
				    a good starting point for searching for the Met&rsquo;s rich collections.
				    Mapping local metadata to the /toah codes and inserting them in a link
				    allows one to go <em>directly</em> from
				    inside any local Web page to the appropriate page <em>within</em> the
				    Met&rsquo;s Web site.</p>
				  <p>The Wikipedia provides a similarly useful design for
				    biographical searching. Creating a URL by adding &ldquo;Firstname_surname&rdquo; to
				    the stem <a href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a> to form, for example, <a href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_smith" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_smith</a>				    will lead directly to biographical article(s) for any person(s) with
				    that name, if any, in the Wikipedia.</p>
				  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
				  <p>Learning, if it is to be more than memorizing, requires
				    an understanding of context. The Web greatly increases the range of accessible
				    resources capable of providing context. However, Internet-accessible
				    resources vary greatly in the metadata vocabularies used to describe
				    and index their resources and in the search support provided. The use
				    of standards should, of course, be encouraged, but mandating the use
				    of the same systems or the same vocabularies is neither possible nor
				    desirable. However, the wider adoption of improved best practices can
				    greatly facilitate the incremental development of interoperability.</p>
				  <p>Searching by topic needs mapping between different
				    topical vocabularies, and automated methods can often provide inexpensive
				    but useful mappings. Place name gazetteers are pivotal for geographic
				    search because they link places with spaces and enable both map visualizations
				    and analysis of spatial relationships between places. A named time period
				    directory can play an analogous role for events, dates, and chronological
				    relationships. Searching for people by name is a well-understood problem,
				    but relating the events in their lives to contextualizing resources needs
				    more development. Searching can be supported by embedding live queries
				    in mark-up and by using meaningful codes in structured URLs.</p>
				  <p>Picking a museum object at random and finding what
				    materials of different kinds elsewhere are most closely related to it
				    and to its context requires substantially better indexing and interoperability
				    than is currently provided, but a series of improvements in standards
				    and best practices will, individually and cumulatively, help us to advance
				    in that direction.</p>
