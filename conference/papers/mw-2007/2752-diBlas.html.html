				<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
				<p class="abstractText">Cultural Heritage is traditionally associated with
				  long-term values and stable (i.e. not rapidly changing) content; consequently,
				  we are used to thinking that 'editorial products' associated
				  with it have a long life and deserve a long-term, well-planned effort.
				  Most museum catalogues, publications, Web sites and multimedia applications
				  follow this pattern: they need sizable development time, significant effort
				  and proportionately significant financial resources.</p>
				<p class="abstractText">Recently, a new necessity is slowly emerging, for
				  a number of reasons: budget is shrinking, new opportunities
				  of communication are springing up, technologies and devices
				  are rapidly changing. Therefore, a new approach can be considered: 'instant
				  multimedia' (analogous
				  to 'instant books') means that in a short span of time and
				  with little budget a good quality multimedia application must
				  be produced, possibly aiming for several technological channels
				  (from Web, to mobile devices, to iPod, to information points,
				  to iPhone ...).</p>
				<p class="abstractText">This investigates the concept of instant multimedia
				  and to identify its basic constituents. Furthermore the paper illustrates
				  a specific paradigm, OneThousandandOneStory, consisting of a design pattern,
				  a workflow, a production method and finally an engine, to generate applications.
				  The paradigm produces high-quality applications that can be delivered as
				  CD-Roms, Information Points, Web sites, Podcasts and, very soon, phone
				  applications. It has been used to generate 11 instant multimedia applications
				  for a variety of partners, including museums, ministries, research teams,
				  and academic institutions. It has been used by College students and, from
				  January 2007, more than three thousand high-school students in Italy will
				  use it to generate their own multimedia narratives about culture and history
				  in their territory.</p>

                <h2 class="PaperTitle">1. Introduction And Motivation</h2>
                <p>Sometimes interesting ideas stem from the least expected situations. In
    October 2005, we at HOC-LAB at Politecnico di Milano were asked to develop,
    in a very short time (approximately one month), an interactive application
    on CD-ROM for an exhibition about Bramantino (a Renaissance painter quite
    active in Lombardia, the region of Milan) that was about to be opened at
    the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana (in cooperation with the National Gallery of London).</p>
  <p>Given the very short lead-time, we had to speed up the production process
    in two respects: cutting down design and programming, and cutting down (time
    and cost of) the preparation of the content. Let us focus on the latter,
    i.e. content production, first. Since the exhibition had already printed
    its own catalogue, and there was neither time nor money to reproduce it in
    an interactive way, we decided to meet the exhibition's curator to interview
    him for a couple of hours and then use the interview as the basis for the
    application's content. Our original idea was to use the format of <strong>interview</strong>:
    in a number of projects, and especially for Learning@Europe (see Di Blas &amp;
    Poggi, 2006), we had already strongly relied upon interviews as an effective
    way to gather high quality content quickly, and also as a format for delivering
    textual content that could be too cumbersome otherwise. After analyzing what
    we had, we realized that in this case it would not be possible to make a
    'multimedia interview' (we had experience with text-based interviews) without
    using video-taking, and that was too expensive for this production. Moreover,
    since a large number of pictures had to be used (all related to the pictures
    in display and referenced by the curator), we wanted to use them in a proper
    way, but we did not want to end up with a pure slide-show (not even if accompanied
    by an audio comment).</p>
  <p>Turning our attention now to the issue of design, basic choices were again
    taken almost by accident: the curator turned out to be a magic storyteller
    who kept us spell-bound for 2 hours. Under the influence of this interview,
    we tried to retain the 'flavor' of what we had experienced, offering to our
    users the possibility of 'listening to the tales' told by the curator. However,
    we had to accommodate the need for variable user experiences, ranging from
    visitors who would not spend more than a few minutes to play with technology,
    to visitors who could spend 20 minutes or more. An additional requirement
    to consider at the same time was Web technology (for on-line users) and CD-Roms
    (for visitors attending the exhibition), as well as podcasting as a future
    option.</p>
  <p>The solution was to break the narrative into 8 <strong>topics</strong>: for each topic
    we would have a short version and a longer version, the latter consisting
    of a set of sub-topics (4 for each topic), as shown in Fig.1.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="diBlas.fig1.pdf"><img src="diBlas.fig1.gif" alt="editorial plan" width="400" height="200" border="0" /></a></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 1: The Bramantino's application editorial plan (<a href="diBlas.fig1.pdf">pdf</a>) </p>
  <p>In terms of the 'user experience' we had the following options in mind:
    the user could focus on the main topics only (short version); the user could
    focus on one topic and its details; the user could get everything (long version);
    the user could just pick up the item of his/her interest (either a topic
    or sub-topic).</p>
  <p>The final decision was about the <strong>medium</strong> for each item; i.e. for each 'topic' or 'subtopic'.
    Again we took a pragmatic decision: an 'audio' reading of a short text coupled
    with visual communication; i.e. a set of flash animations highlighting details.
    This choice ensured quality (i.e. impact for the user) at the same time as
    low cost, since the audio was obtained by 'reading' a text rather than directly
    editing (in audio and/or in video) the interview. </p>
  <p>The production experiment was extremely successful. The interview's transcript
    was done, adjustments and additions were made in record time (by asking the
    curator very specific questions, in order to integrate missing pieces of
    information), and in 3 days all the texts were ready (for audio recording)
    in final version. When the exhibition opened, on December 5<sup>th</sup> 2005,
    the CD-Rom was shown in the installation (putting the narrative in a loop)
    and also distributed, with great appreciation from the public.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="diBlas.fig2.jpg" alt="Fig 2: Bramantino&rsquo;s application: the home page" width="400" height="221" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 2: Bramantino's application: the home page</p>
  <p>From the Bramantino exhibition we learned some lessons, the most important
    of which was the following: cutting down costs and time, without significantly
    affecting the quality of the communication, is a strategic direction, rather
    than an accident. </p>
  <p>There are several reasons to consider this a strategy, rather than an accident,
    for the whole field of Cultural Heritage:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assuming that a fixed budget is available (for a given period of time),
      it is better both for users and for cultural institutions to produce several
      low-cost productions, rather than a few expensive ones. More issues can
      be covered, rather than fewer.</li>
    <li>Small, lean, low cost, productions can be targeted to different niches
      of potential users, and/or can deal with several niches of content.</li>
    <li>Small, fast productions allow a cultural institution to react quickly
      to fresh needs or to catch new opportunities presented by exhibitions,
      technology, external events, etc.</li>
    <li>Multimedia productions tend to become obsolete (or at least, not tuned
      to current user expectations) quite quickly; this is a major problem for
      large productions that can't be easily redone, while is a minor problem
      for small low-cost productions that can more easily be discarded or redone.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>On the basis of the above considerations, we have developed a different
    strategy with respect to our past (see for example Di Blas, Paolini, Poggi
    2004), focusing on low-cost, fast production, possible service to multiple
    purposes (e.g. interactive information point, self-running information point,
    portable guide, podcasting...). </p>
  <p>For this class of applications we coined the term <strong>instant multimedia</strong>,
    evoking the concept of 'instant books', i.e. applications of good quality
    that can be put on the market in a short time. Besides the above considerations,
    we had an additional requirement: to spend less time on info-architecture
    and design in order to focus on 'deep content'; i.e. the
    'cultural message', rather than using resources for high-end content (e.g.
    high-quality video, 3D graphics, etc.). In this way, we felt, the impact
    on the user could be deeper.</p>
  <h2>2. The Instant Multimedia Package</h2>
  <p>In order to make instant multimedia 'real', an <strong>instant multimedia package</strong> is
    needed, consisting of a few elements:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> An <strong>instant
      design pattern</strong>: an appropriate pattern or predefined solution (Folmer
      et al., 2006; Paolini et al., 1999; van Duyne et al., 2002; Welie &amp; Traetteberg,
      2000) that can be completed (reliably and quickly) by a simple adaptation
      to the specific needs of the production currently under way.</li>
  <li>An <strong>instant
      workflow pattern</strong>: the plan of activities is predefined; it must simply
      be adapted to the specific needs of the current production.</li>
  <li> An <strong>instant
      content production method</strong>: the method for producing content must be
      already defined and easily applicable in most circumstances.</li>
  <li> An <strong>instant
      multimedia technology</strong>: an easy-to-use and reliable software application
      must be available to support the efficient generation and publication (possibly
      on different channels) of the application.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Different styles of instant multimedia can be obtained by using different
    packages, or at least different design patterns. Instant multimedia can be
    considered also an outpost version
    of the (so called) CMS's, <strong>Content Management Systems</strong>: systems where
    content is inserted (through data entry of some complexity), and publishing
    is almost automatic. Some CMS's prefer flexibility, 'info-architecture power',
    interface personalization, etc. The consequences are more flexible design,
    more time to configure the system and to put it in place, and more complex
    data entry. Instant multimedia emphasizes speed and low cost, therefore less
    flexible design, very simple data entry, little control over the interface,
    etc.</p>
  <p>There are other examples of systems that we consider half-way between traditional
    CMS's and Instant Multimedia. The 'Medina' effort (Garzotto, 2006) and 'Pachyderm' (LaMar
    et al., 2005; Samis, 2005) are examples of this trend: a standardization
    of design concepts and layout that allows fast production of quality applications.</p>
  <p>In the next two sections we will describe a specific
    Instant Multimedia package, directly derived from the Bramantino exhibition,
    that we called <strong>OneThousandandOneStory</strong>.</p>
  <p>In Section 3 we describe the design pattern,
    the workflow and the content production method; in Section 4 we describe
    the technology; i.e. the engine that supports data entry and generates the
    final applications. </p>
  <h2>3. OneThousandandOneStory</h2>
  <p><strong>OneThousandandOneStory</strong> is an instant multimedia package developed by the
    HOC laboratory of Politecnico di Milano. (It will be also demonstrated in
    a special session of Museums and the Web 2007.) In different versions it
    has been used for building 11 applications (as of January 07), for different
    clients and purposes: promotion of HOC activities, in museums (Pinacoteca
    Ambrosiana, Museo Archeologico di Milano), in the ministry of Tourism of
    Syria, in ministries of the Mediterranean area, in the Dean's office of Politecnico
    di Milano. As of January 07, OneThousandandOneStory is being considered by
    other cultural institutions (e.g. the Herman Hesse Museum near Lugano, Switzerland)
    and by other national initiatives (in cooperation with the Italian Ministry
    for Cultural Heritage); it is also the basis for a national competition involving
    nearly 3,000 high school students from 10 different Regions. It has also
    been used by students at USI (University of Italian Switzerland) as a basis
    for content authoring exercises. Figures 3, 4 and 5 display some screenshots
    from the Archeological Museum of Milan application, with some examples of
    the related narratives.</p>

      included. Frescoes can still be seen in its inner walls, dating back to
      the XV century, when the tower was transformed into a chapel inside the
      monastery...&quot; </p>

      museum is considered one of the most rare archaeological findings from
      the late Roman Empire. What makes the cup so unique, apart from its aesthetic
      value, is the manufacturing technique, that remains a secret even for nowadays
      glass manufacturers. The technique refers to glass openwork and was mastered
      by very few experts in the Antiquity&quot; </p>
  <h2>The First 3 Components Of This Instant Multimedia Package</h2>
  <h3>3.1 The Design Pattern</h3>
  <p>The design pattern for OneThosusandandOneStory is a generalization of what
    we have used for the Bramantino exhibition described in section 1. In the
    generalization process we had a few requirements in mind:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The
    information architecture had to support engagement and to raise interest,
    rather than provide information. </li>
  <li>The
    pattern had to be content-independent, i.e. able to transmit various kinds
    of content.</li>
  <li>The
    pattern had to be suitable for different technological channels: i.e. Web,
    CD-Rom, and mobile devices (iPod overall, but also mobile phones).</li>
  <li> The pattern
    had to support different user experiences: e.g. quick overview, 'get everything', 'dig
    deeper', information point, play lists (for iPod, for example), etc.</li>
  <li>The
    information architecture had to be simple for the author (in order
    to speed up customization and adaptation) but at the same time capable
    of supporting different user experiences.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The design pattern we came up with is very simple indeed, but it is apparently
    able to satisfy the above requirements:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> We
    chose a narrative style, based on visualization and audio, rather than on
    text.</li>
  <li> As
    far as content goes, the format is versatile, covering a wide range of possibilities:
    describing sections of museums, exhibitions, cultural tourism destinations,
    tourists' days in cities, technical projects, university curricula, etc.</li>
  <li>By
    carefully separating the data entry process from application generation,
    we can support CD-Rom, Web sites and podcasting. Versions for other mobile
    devices (e.g. iPhones) are underway.</li>
  <li> We can support
    quick interactive tours (4-6 minutes), complete narratives (20-30 minutes),
    exploration of a complete subject (4-6 minutes), play in a loop (for information
    points), play as a play-list, etc.</li>
  <li> The
    information architecture is strikingly simple. An application is broken up
    in
    &quot;topics&quot;, each one being assigned 1 minute at most: the optimal number of
    topics is between 4 and 8. For each topic a 'dig-deeper' option is offered,
    with a number of sub-topics, ranging again between 4 and 8, and with allocation
    of at most 1 minute each. Each topic or subtopic is allocated an audio narrative
    (determining the amount of time required) and a number of still images (with
    range between 3 and 6 suggested). Pictures can be substituted (in the
    'professional version' only) by video and/or animations.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>3.2 The Workflow</h2>
  <p>The workflow is divided into 10 major steps.</p>
  <h3>W1: Gathering Of The &quot;Raw&quot; Material And A General Idea (1-2 Hours)</h3>
  <p>The preliminary actions are quite simple: focusing on the subject, talking
    loosely with the expert, collecting the pictures already available, consulting
    the text already available (if any).</p>
  <p>At the end of this step the generic idea of the narrative is made clear
    and agreed between the project staff and the expert.</p>
  <h3>W2: Editorial Plan (1-2 Hours)</h3>
  <p>The project staff, together with the expert, transforms the general idea
    into a precise plan; i.e. identifies each topic and subtopic. The editorial
    plan may be revised when the content is actually produced (see below), but
    it is better to start the content production with a precise idea of the envisioned
    outcome.</p>
  <h3>W3: Visual Communication (3-8 Hours)</h3>
  <p>In the 'professional' version of the format we can accommodate different
    kinds of visual communication, including flash animations, videos, slideshows
    of images (including power point presentations) etc. In the simplest version
    (like, for example, the one we provide for schools) we only allow still images:
    they are played in a sequence with the audio.</p>
  <p>In our format there is no strict synchronization between the images and
    the audio: images are meant to be <em>evocative</em> (rather than identifying
    or descriptive) of the topic. This lack of strict synchronization allows
    great freedom for the author, and also cuts down time and cost. Strict synchronization
    can be simulated by carefully placing images in the proper order, in order
    to get them along with the audio at the right moment (more or less, of course).</p>
  <h3>W4: Writing The Narratives (8-16 Hours)</h3>
  <p>This is a crucial step. A text must be produced, for each topic or subtopic:
    the time depends on the technique of production (see the corresponding paragraph).
    Each piece (topic or subtopic) needs something between 90 and 120 words;
    we can estimate the time for production of the first version of text at between
    15 minutes and 25 minutes each: a 6-topic narrative (with an average of 5
    subtopics each) has 36 narrative elements (audio pieces), and can therefore
    take something between 540 minutes and 900 minutes, plus some additional
    editorial time.</p>
  <h3>W5: From Text To Audio (4-8 Hours)</h3>
  <p>Our experience shows that it is better to make a revision with registered
    audio, rather than with just the textual narratives. Recording 36 fragments
    of 1 minute each may take varying times, according to whether a professional
    studio (as we suggest) is used, or an in-house production is used.</p>
  <h3>W6: First Version: Putting The Pieces Together (2 Hours)</h3>
  <p>Using the engine, in order to create the first version, the following pieces
    must be inserted:</p>
	<ul>
  <li> all
    the texts of the stories and subtopics (including the titles for the users
    of each element)</li>
  <li> the
    images (including captions)</li>
  <li> the
    audio files</li>
	</ul>
  <p>Partial or global previews allow an easy check of the partial work </p>
  <h3>W7: Quality Check (2-4 Hours)</h3>
  <p>The overall impact of the result must be checked when all the content is
    there. Checking may find trivial mistakes (e.g. wrong picture, fault in the
    text, etc.) or discover flaws in cultural quality and completeness. The thoroughness
    of this test depends, obviously, on the level of perfection being sought,
    and also on the concrete possibility for improvements (depending on available
    resources). </p>
  <h3>W8: Revising Text And Audio (4-8 Hours)</h3>
  <p>According to the observations of W7, the texts can be improved, and consequently
    a new session of audio recording and editing may be necessary.</p>
  <h3>W9: Revising Visual Communication (1-4 Hours)</h3>
  <p>Critical evaluation of the pictures may involve shifting them around and/or,
    most important of all, selecting other pictures to reinforce the visual communication.</p>
  <h3>W10: Final Version (2 Hours)</h3>
  <p>The revised audio files, texts and pictures (with captions) can be inserted
    and, after a quick check, the generation can be accomplished: a Web version,
    a CD-ROM version and a set of files for pod-casting can be generated in one
    step.</p>
  <p>From the above workflow we can see that more or less <strong>28 hours is the
      minimum amount</strong> of time needed, while <strong>56 hours is the maximum</strong>.
      These rough estimates, of course, can't be taken as scientific determination,
      but rather are the results of our experience over several developments.</p>
  <h2>3.3 Content Production</h2>
  <p>One key ingredient for an instant multimedia package, in order to be successful,
    is a fast and reliable way to produce content. 'Fast'
    means little time and little budget; 'reliable' means quality, at the level
    needed for the type of production. As far as content production goes, there
    are three key ingredients of <strong>OneThousandandOneStory</strong>: transcribed interviews
    (with transcription and subsequent reading by professional speakers), evocative
    images, and professional speakers.</p>
  <h4><strong><em>Interviews</em></strong> </h4>
  <p>We use interviews with highly competent people to get the texts that later
    will generate audio. The reasons in favor of transcribed interviews are several:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    a couple of hours all the basic content can be obtained; videotaped interviews
    or audio interviews (when the original recording has to be used) take much
    more time and more preliminary work, often with an inferior result.</li>
  <li> Competent
    people, when properly interviewed, can tell wonderful stories, often much
    more engaging than those obtained by written contributions (that would take
    also too much time).</li>
  <li> Experts,
    when engaged in a discussion, tend to use the terms and the tone most suitable
    for transformation into a narrative that is engaging.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><strong><em>Evocative Images</em></strong></h4>
  <p>The audio narrative is the driving force to keep the user absorbed; images
    add an emotional aspect, rather than providing strictly rational information.
    The advantages are several:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> The
    attention of the user is kept focused on what is being said.</li>
  <li> Even
    abstract subjects or concepts can be conveyed by the narratives, with images
    only emotionally enriching the presentation.</li>
  <li> The
    choice of images can be delayed or modified at will, without need to rework
    the production.</li>
  <li> Strict
    synchronization (between images and audio comment) can be avoided, again
    greatly simplifying production and reducing costs.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><strong><em>Professional Narrators</em></strong></h4>
  <p>We prefer professionals to the use of 'author speakers', such as the curator,
    for example. Although speeches by authors can be very emotional, they are
    more difficult to organize, more expensive (due to editing costs), and often,
    for 25-30 minutes of audio, of inferior quality.</p>
  <h2>4. OneThousandOneStory: Technology</h2>
  <p>Aapplication engine is the cornerstone of the instant multimedia approach.
      Through the engine a number of advantages can be obtained:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> The
      workflow can focus the main effort on content production, rather than on
      technology and implementation. Resources can therefore be easily spent
      for content revision, evaluation, testing, and quality assurance.</li>
  <li> The
      design team does not have to take any technological decisions (software
      architecture, databases, programming language) and does not have to invest
      a penny in implementation.</li>
  <li> The
      competencies required in the production team mainly concern cultural heritage,
      communication, content, semiotics, domain-knowledge, rather than technology.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="caption">Fig 6: The engine <strong>OneThousandandOneStory</strong>: editorial plan
    ( left) and content ( right) </p>
  <p>The engine (<strong>Milleeunastoria</strong> in Italian and <strong>OneThousandandOneStory</strong> in
      English) has been developed in a number of different versions by HOC-lab
      in the year 2006. It has been used, so far, by the staff of the laboratory,
      by high school students and by college students. In January 2007 thousands
      of students started using it for the competition Policultura (http://www.policultura.it);
      the engine has been made available to schools around Italy.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="diBlas.fig7.gif" alt="Fig 7: The architecture for the QST engine" width="360" height="366" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 7: The architecture for the QST engine </p>
  <p>Figure 7 summarizes the main functional architecture for
      the QST engine. The most important components of the engine are Data Entry,
      Preview and Generation.</p>
  <ul>
  <li> <strong>Data
      Entry</strong> <br />
  A simple panel of controls allows the user to edit the editorial plan (i.e. the
structure in topics and subtopics), to enter content for each element (i.e. title,
text, images with captions and audio file), and to perform all needed changes.     </li>
<li> <strong>Preview</strong> <br />
  <p>A simple mechanism allows the user to immediately check the quality of one
    element (topic or sub-topic) or of the whole application, by simulating it
    in an interactive version.</p>
</li>
    <li> <strong>Generation</strong> <br />
    Only at the end the whole application is production generated for the different
channels.     </li>
</ul>
  <p>In order to avoid technicalities for the development team,
      in the current version the engine is provided as a Web service. The production
      team remotely inserts data and looks at previews; when the work is complete,
      the generated application (that can be quite sizable) is available on the
      server. The generation of the applications (for the different channels)
      takes virtually no time.</p>
  <h2>5. Conclusions And Future Work</h2>
  <p>Instant multimedia could become a pervasive phenomenon for Cultural Heritage:
    numerous small, good quality applications made available for different channels
    and supporting different user experiences. Users today are more likely to
    pay attention to small applications, possibly available on their mobile devices,
    rather than to 'consume' large, expensive applications.</p>
  <p>In order to make this vision real, the Cultural Heritage community needs
    reliable Instant Multimedia Packages, possibly evolved from current Content
    Management Systems or from efforts like Pachiderm (LaMar et al., 2005; Samis,
    2005), MEDINA (Garzotto, 2006) and similar applications. We hope that in
    the near future cultural institutions willing to develop a new lean and low-budget
    application will be allowed to choose among a dozen  different options,
    in terms of format, technology, user experience, etc.</p>
  <p>HOC-LAB (and its partner, TEC-LAB) are committed to the following developments:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Further improving (in terms of usability) the engine of <strong>OneThousandandOneStory</strong> and
      making it available as open source Software,</li>
    <li>Developing new versions of this engine in order to support different
      technologies (iPhone, for example),</li>
    <li>Developing a family of new engines in order to support different design
      patterns and different user experiences.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most important of all, we are working together with cultural institutions
    to make instant multimedia more widely used, and to provide more satisfactory
    experiences for users.</p>
