    <h1>Background: What is Vodcasting? </h1>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Video podcast (sometimes shortened to vidcast or vodcast)
      is a term used for the on-line delivery of video on demand video clip content
      via Atom or RSS enclosures. The term is an evolution specialized for video,
      coming from the generally audio-based podcast and referring to the distribution
      of video where the RSS feed is used as a non-linear TV channel to which
      consumers can subscribe using a PC, TV, set-top box, media center or mobile
      multimedia device). <em>Wikipedia</em> </p>
    <p>Strictly speaking, vodcasting is video distributed on-line, via an RSS
      feed. In this workshop we will first focus on the creation of the video,
      and include other on-line forms of distribution, such as streaming, and
      offering the video for download directly from a Web site (i.e. not necessarily
      via an RSS feed). Secondly, we will tackle how to send videos over an RSS
      feed - essentially providing on-demand video - or a &ldquo;true&rdquo; vodcast. </p>
    <p>The benefits of RSS feeds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visitors to your Web site can subscribe once and receive all future
        updates.</li>
      <li>Visitors can manage their video; for example, using iTunes.</li>
      <li>It makes good use of bandwidth because the video can be downloaded
        in &lsquo;downtime&rsquo; (ie while you are away from computer).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The benefits of streamed video:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is harder for people to copy your video content and abuse copyright.</li>
      <li>It is quick to load if the video is streamed      &lsquo;progressively&rsquo;;
        i.e. visitors do not need to wait for the whole movie to download before
        viewing it; rather, the video can be viewed as it is downloaded. </li>
      <li>One disadvantage is that you can only watch the video content when
        on-line. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Benefits of downloadable video direct from your site:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This method brings visitors back to your Web site for new content,
        so offers a good marketing opportunity for you to show them other material
        at the same time.</li>
      <li>Once downloaded, the video can be (re)watched off-line at any time;
        for instance, on a PDA or portable media devices, on a train or in the
        gallery. This can also help get around firewall issues encountered in
        some organizations. </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Workshop Introduction </h1>
    <p>This is a practical workshop which shows how to create a vodcast in a
      day. It is important to note that it is easy and often worthwhile to spend
      more than a day creating a vodcast, but it is not always necessary. A day
      can be enough to create a short, basic clip, as we will show you today &ndash; in
      the hope that this will give you the confidence to start making vodcasts
      yourselves and relatively quickly. </p>
    <h2>Step 1: Conceptualising And Scripting &ndash; The Importance Of Preparation</h2>
    <p>It is advantageous to conduct an interview based around something that
      is already happening in the gallery or exhibitions space, as it will provide
      you with a topical subject to discuss with your artist or interviewee.
      Check your institution&rsquo;s events calendar and exhibition programme
      to see what opportunities there are for filming. The content you create
      will be great additional media-rich content to sit on your microsite or
      exhbition page. </p>
    <h3>i) Consider your audience - are they the general gallery visitor or are
      they more scholarly?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider their level of knowledge and expertise.</li>
      <li>Consider their attention span.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>ii) Consider your subject matter; for example, the artist and their work.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If interviewing an artist, are you going to discuss a particular show?</li>
      <li>Do you want to cover their work retrospectively, or will you focus
        on 1 or 2 works? </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>iii) Prepare your questions and tailor standard questions where possible.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure you research the artist and their work or the show that you
        will be discussing.</li>
      <li>Pick out any specific issues relating to their working method; for
        example, do they work alone or collaborate? Do they usually work in a
        certain way or with a particular medium?</li>
      <li>Always prepare more questions than you anticipate asking in case you
        have to unexpectedly abandon certain questions during the conversation,
        but try to keep your questions relatively simple and allow the artist
        to talk freely.</li>
      <li>If you are interviewing for a group show, use the same questions (as
        far as sensible) for each artist (when relevant), for continuity and
        comparison of views.</li>
      <li>Similarly, if you are going to conduct a series of interviews over
        a period of time, you can tailor some standard questions each time to
        suit your needs. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are a set of possible questions you could consider using:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Can you talk us through/describe these particular works?</li>
      <li>Can you tell us about your creative process and how you develop ideas
        for new work?</li>
      <li>What processes were involved in actually making these pieces?</li>
      <li>Is the &lsquo;process of making&rsquo; important to you?</li>
      <li>Is the specificity of medium important to you?</li>
      <li>Are titles important? What is the significance of them<em>?</em> </li>
      <li>Is the actual materiality of your work central to your practice? Why?</li>
      <li>Why are you sometimes drawn to working with different mediums?</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Is there an overarching theme that underpins your practice?</li>
      <li>Can you tell us about your latest works and more specifically, how
        they relate to your other works?</li>
      <li>Can you explain why &lsquo;xx xx xx&rsquo; is integral to your practice?</li>
      <li>How important is the audience&rsquo;s experience in relation to your
        work?</li>
      <li>What other artists have influenced you?</li>
      <li>What are you currently working on?</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>iv) Consider who should conduct the interview:</h3>
    <p>Who is the best person to conduct the interview? It might be more relevant
      for you to work with a colleague in another department; for example an
      interpretation curator, a conservator, or an exhibition curator.</p>
    <h3>v) Consider where you will conduct the interview:</h3>
    <p>Note: it is worth considering the equipment you will be using before you
      consider possible locations. For example, will you be using the built-in
      microphone on your camera, or a radio transmitter microphone? Are you going
      to rely on natural lighting, or do you have a portable light and/or light
      reflector? </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Try to get as interesting a location as possible - one that will be
        visually interesting but also relevant. Good examples are the artist&rsquo;s
        studio, or the actual exhibition space within the gallery, (it&rsquo;s
        great to see the works <em>in situ</em> in the background as you talk
        about them, as the video viewers will feel a sense of &lsquo;being there&rsquo; even
        if they cannot make it to the physical gallery). Also, when these interviews
        are archived, they will also provide a useful document of the occasion.</li>
      <li>Always conduct a quick rece of the location before you meet the artists
        and shoot the interviews. Think about where you want them to stand and
        where the best light is situated. The more prepared you are when you
        meet them, the more confident you will make them feel.</li>
      <li>Make sure you check for obvious things such as the noise levels. If
        an exhibition is being set up, you might want to conduct the interview
        at a time when you can arrange for there to be less noise; for example,
        during lunch breaks. If the artist works using time-based media, you
        may need to arrange for the artwork to be switched on and working. If
        you intend to use a public space as your backdrop, you might want to
        check that there will not be a large school party decending on the space
        as you are about to shoot your interview.</li>
      <li>If you are unable to use an exhibition space or artist studio, or if
        it is not relevant to do so, again try and find an interesting location
        with an interesting background. You might want to re-arrange a meeting
        room in advance to make it look more interesting.&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 2. Film Interview (Equipment Choices, Lighting And Audio Tips, Style
      And Technique) </h2>
    <p>Now that you have arranged where you want to conduct your interview and
      you have fixed a date and time with your artist or interviewee, you want
      to shoot the interview. One obvious tip is to check well in advance that
      your equipment is working correctly and that all your batteries and any
      back-up batteries are fully charged. If you are using lighting equipment,
      check that the light bulbs have not blown, also that your microphone is
      not faulty. Allow time for someone to fix damaged equipment if need be,
      or for you to go out and buy a replacement.</p>
    <h3>i) Consider whether or not you want the interviewers to be present in
      the video; e.g. do you want to see them or hear them?</h3>
    <p>It can be less complicated when you come to edit, not to have the interviewer
      visible or heard. It means you only need to worry about one audio level
      and you can focus on your subject. It can be quite difficult for your video
      cast viewer to hear clearly a question that is being asked off screen.
      However, you might decide that it is relevant to show both your interviewer
      and interviewee in the same shot. Beware that you may find it harder to
      get the audio levels equal. I would advise that you keep it as simple as
      possible: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Record your interview focusing on just the artist, then later when
        you edit the interview, insert the questions as text captions either
        by using the Insert Text option in iMovie, or by creating your own text
        inserts in Photoshop. This method is a bit like the old silent movies,
        and it does have its benefits. Accessibilty-wise you will reach a greater
        audience. If you have the budegt and the time, you might want to add
        subtitles throughout your entire interview. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other more complicated filming options include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Capturing the interviewee in your camera&rsquo;s viewfinder and having
        the questions heard off screen.</li>
      <li>Capturing the interviewer asking the questions as a cut away shot,
        and then cutting to the interviewee answering the question.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>ii) Remember to consider the shooting style options, which include:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Letterbox, widescreen, 16:9 </li>
      <li>4:3 (standard television size) UK</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stylistically, it will look more &lsquo;filmic&rsquo; if shot in Letterbox,
      widescreen, 16:9. </p>
    <h3>iii) Consider how you want to compose your film in the camera&rsquo;s
      viewfinder:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It is a good idea to position the artist roughly face on and have the
        interviewer (the person asking the questions) sitting or standing, whichever
        is most appropriate, next to the camera, but off camera, so that the
        artist is looking at the interviewer and just off left or right of the
        camera&rsquo;s lens. This will depend on which side of the camera the
        interviewer is sitting. It means that the interviewee is not directly
        addressing the viewer, and this often looks best on camera.</li>
      <li>Ideally, position the camera so that the artist or interviewee is looking
        into the largest space in the camera shot, so if the artists are positioned
        to the left of the camera shot, frame them so they are looking into the
        right of the shot, the largest space.&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>iv) Consider your lighting options:</h3>
    <p>Natural light:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If there is enough natural light (most digital cameras will have an
        automatic aperture control, which means they will adjust themselves to
        how much light is coming through the camera&rsquo;s aperture for you),
        this is the easiest and cheapest option. Have your artist or interviewee
        facing the natural light source.</li>
      <li>You can hold white paper, card or aluminium foil under the face and
        neck of the artist or interviewee (out of shot) to reflect as much natural
        light as possible back on them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additional light:</p>
    <p>Even with a small budget you can achieve better results, so it is worth
      considering buying cheap lighting.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can buy fluorescent shop lights which are cheap, give off a good &lsquo;natural
        white light&rsquo; and look soft on screen. They have the added bonus
        of not getting too hot for your interviewee who has to sit under them.
        Note that halogen lights can get very hot!</li>
      <li>You could buy a cheap photographic light and stand, such as the Tri-lite
        by Bowens. This has a fluorescent lamp with around 220-240 volts and
        a maximun wattage of 3x30. A light like this would serve you well. Two
        lights would serve you very well, but if you cannot afford two, buy one
        and consider buying a reflector, which is cheaper and almost as effective.</li>
      <li>It is better to reflect light on to your subject, either off a wall
        or the ceiling. Play around, positioning the lighting in various places
        to get the best results. Ideally, do this before your interviewees arrive,
        but you will need to adjust the lights to suit their specific skins tones
        when they do arrive. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>v) Consider your recording audio levels.</h3>
    <p>Three possible options:</p>
    <p>The camera&rsquo;s built-in microphone. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>As the name suggests, it is built-in to the camera and is usually quite
        adequate, but you will need to be positioned quite near to your subjects
        to pick up what they are saying. On-line, audio is of a high importance
        to the viewer and probably more so than the video footage. </li>
      <li>Be aware or the fact that not only will this microphone pick up what
        your interviewee is saying, but it will also pick up any sound around
        them. If you are in a busy gallery environment, you may pick up unwanted
        peripheral noises. It is hard to remove these sounds in post production,
        so do not make the mistake of relying on doing this. If you do have to
        use the camera&rsquo;s built-in microphone, keep close to your subjects
        (a head and shoulders shot ideally) and ask them to speak up if you need
        to. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Lavaliere microphone</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Worth investing in, this mike clips onto the lapel of your subject
        and wires directly into the camera; it gives you a much higher quality
        recording than the onboard camera mic.</li>
      <li>With lavalieres, be attentive to hair noise (long-haired subjects),
        and face scratching noise (beards can be surprisingly loud!). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Wireless transmitter microphone</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Again worth investing in, this mike is comprised of a wireless microphone
        transmitter and a wireless reciever. The microphone clips onto the lapel
        of the interviewee and is wired up to a transmitter box that can sit
        in their back pocket. Sound is then transmitted via wireless VHS radio
        to the receiver, which sits on top of the camera and is connected to
        the camera via the &lsquo;in put&rsquo; microphone socket.</li>
      <li>This option allows greater freedom of movement and means you can have
        your subjects heard over any peripheral background noise. They can walk
        around and away from the camera and still be heard. The sound quality
        is also richer and of a higher quality.</li>
      <li>Always record one minute of room tone either before or after your interview
        in case you need blank audio to cover up pauses, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Another piece of essential kit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Invest in a good sturdy tripod for your camera. The heavier the better:
        it is a very worthwhile investment. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you have shot your interview, you need to get the footage on to your
      computer to edit it.</p>
    <h2>Step 3. Edit And Encode Video (Software, Process And Quality) </h2>
    <h3>i) Begin by importing your footage: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Open iMovie and name and save a new project. Give your project a name
        that will help you to retrieve archived footage later. (Also label your
        DVCam tapes well if you are using DVCam. Consider including the project
        title, the artist&rsquo;s name, the interviewee, the location, the date
        it took place and the duration of the finished edit in minutes and seconds.
        Consider including this information in your video credits too). </li>
      <li>Connect your video camera to your Mac with a WireFire lead (it will
        say <strong>Camera Connected</strong>) and copy your footage over from
        the camera into iMovie HD (as you import your video interview footage
        from a standard high definition camera via FireWire into an iMovie project,
        it will automatically divide your video footage into individual clips).</li>
      <li>Click on <strong>Import</strong> to import the footage - you might
        want to just play the footage in the Preview Window first, to select
        the footage you want to import into the Mac. Doing this will save you
        some valuable time later. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig1.jpg" alt="Fig 1: Importing footage in iMovie " width="400" height="301" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 1: Importing footage in iMovie </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on <strong>Import</strong> again to stop importing the footage &ndash; you
        might want to fast forward to another section.</li>
      <li>Once imported, you can arrange the clips in any order by dragging the
        clips from the Clips Pane into the Clip Viewer/Timeline at the bottom
        of the window. Do not worry about being accurate at this stage as you
        can re-arrange the order later if you wish.</li>
      <li>Click on a clip in the Clips Pane to view it in the Viewing Panel (press
        play to view it).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig2.jpg" alt="Fig 2: View clips in the Viewing Panel " width="400" height="298" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2: View clips in the Viewing Panel </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Double click on the clip in the Clips Pane to re-name it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig3.jpg" alt="Fig 1: Importing footage in iMovie " width="400" height="290" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 3: Re-name your clips </p>
    <p>Note that you will spend a fair bit of time viewing your clips and selecting
      the footage that you want to use. It is worth cutting out the footage you
      do not want at this stage. Use the timeline frame counter to help you navigate
      through your footage. You can make a rough selection of edits that you
      think are suitable &ndash; then you might enlist the opinion of a colleague
      to review them and make further selections. They can use the Preview Window
      counter to pinpoint &lsquo;in&rsquo; and &lsquo;out&rsquo; points. One
      advantage of this is they do not need to be able to edit using iMovie;
      they can simply write down the numbers and hand them to you and you can
      then make the edits later.</p>
    <p>If you have any unwanted clips, delete them or drag them into the trash
      (they remain retrievable until you delete the trash).</p>
<h3>    ii) Begin making your edit - 2 easy-to-remember ways to edit your
        footage:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cropping &ndash; Here you can either trim off footage that you do not
        want or you can select embedded footage you want to keep and delete the
        footage either side of it that you do not want to keep</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Splitting &ndash; Here you take a video clip and split it into two
        parts, keeping both if you want them. You might find that one segment
        actually answers two questions and you would like to divide that segment
        into two parts and place them at different times in the video interview.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No doubt, you will probably find one technique that you prefer and use
      most.</p>
<h3>    iii) Cropping:</h3>    <ul>
      <li>Select your clip in the Clip Viewer/Timeline</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig4.jpg" alt="Fig 4: Select your clip in the Timeline " width="497" height="256" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 4: Select your clip in the Timeline </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hover your mouse over the scrubber bar (the blue bar directly under
        your large Preview Window); the crop markers will be visible (you have
        one for your entry point and one for your out point).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig5.jpg" alt="Fig 5: Crop markers for your in and out entry points" width="99" height="103" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 5: Crop markers for your in and out entry points </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Drag the left crop marker along the scrubber bar to find the exact
        location that you want your clip to begin.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig6.jpg" alt="Fig 6: Mark where you want your clip to begin" width="400" height="144" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 6: Mark where you want your clip to begin </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Drag the right crop marker along the scrubber bar until you find the
        point where you want the clip to finish (your out mark). You can do this
        as many times as you need, and view the footage as you do to get the
        exact spot. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note the footage you will be keeping will be in yellow on the scrubber
      bar. The footage you will be deleting will be in blue.&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select <strong>Edit</strong> in the menu bar and <strong>Crop</strong> &ndash;      this
        will delete the frames either side of your crop markers. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig7.jpg" alt="Fig 7: Select Edit in the menu bar and Crop " width="400" height="318" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 7: Select Edit in the menu bar and Crop </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always view your crop straight away to make sure you have cropped correctly.
        If you make a mistake, you can go to <strong>Edit </strong>and <strong>Undo
        Crop</strong>. If the crop was a success, save it!</li>
    </ul>
<h3>    iv) Splitting: </h3>    <ul>
      <li>To split your footage, select your clip in the Clip Viewer/Timeline </li>
      <li>Hover your mouse over the crop markers (the blue bar directly under
        your large preview panel; the crop markers look like half triangles and
        sit just under the Playhead marker) and select the frame where you want
        to split the clip in two.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig8.jpg" alt="Fig 8: Select the frame where you want to split the clip" width="400" height="266" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 8: Select the frame where you want to split the clip </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select <strong>Edit</strong> and <strong>Split Video Clip at Playhead</strong>,
        you will notice that there are now two clips and you can either delete
        the one you do not want or move it somewhere else in your timeline. It
        is advisable at this stage to re-name your two split clips. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig9.jpg" alt="Fig 1: Importing footage in iMovie " width="400" height="399" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 9: Select Edit and Split Video Clip at Playhead</p>
    <p>&nbsp; When you play your video, the clips will appear as you have arranged
      them in the timeline. If you do not like the order, simply re-arrange the
      clips in the clip viewer, by dragging and dropping them where you want
      them. Remember, the order in which you filmed your interview does not have
      to be the order in which you present your video. </p>
    <p> Also, remember to keep saving the changes you have made. If you want
      to view your audio in the timeline, go to the <strong>View menu</strong> and <strong>Show
      Audio Waveforms</strong>. This is useful if you want to see exactly where
      your sound starts and stops.</p>
    <p><strong>v) How to crop and delete frames embedded within a clip:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select a section of a clip in the Clip Viewer/Timeline by dragging
        the crop markers below the scrubber bar to where you want your clip to
        begin and end. Remember that the fames you will keep are in yellow.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig10.jpg" alt="Fig 10: The frames you will keep are in yellow" width="400" height="366" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 10: The frames you will keep are in yellow</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the <strong>Edit</strong> menu and then select <strong>Crop</strong> or <strong>Clear</strong> to
        remove the section. You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move
        frame by frame through your footage, <strong>or</strong> hold down the
        shift key while pressing the arrow key to move 10 frames at a time.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>    vi) How to create your titles and credits:</h3>    <p>You can do this in iMovie, using the various titles options available
      to choose from. However, I suggest that you create them in, for example,
      Photoshop, and then very simply import them into iMovie. The advantages
      are you will have more control over your style of font, and you will be
      able to fill the screen with a lot more text than you can in the text entry
      boxes offered in iMovie. </p>
    <p>Creating credits and titles in iMovie:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select the first clip in your Clip Viewer/Timeline and then click <strong>Editing</strong> and
        the <strong>Titles</strong> button. You can select various titles, though
        most you will find unsuitable. Titles that bounce across the screen might
        be just too much of a distraction from your subject! <strong>Centered
        Title</strong> is a good general option. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig11.jpg" alt="Fig 11: Select the first clip in your Clip Viewer/Timeline" width="400" height="410" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 11: Select the first clip in your Clip Viewer/Timeline</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig12.jpg" alt="Fig 12: Select Editing and the Titles button" width="350" height="649" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 12: Select Editing and the Titles button</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Type your question text, credit text, copyright text, etc. into the
        text field box (again you will be restricted by the number of credits
        you can enter.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig13.jpg" alt="Fig 13: Type your text into the text field box" width="337" height="344" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 13: Type your text into the text field box</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you want the credits to appear over a black background, select your
        title, choose your font size, etc., and then tick the <strong>Over black</strong> tick
        box. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig14.jpg" alt="Fig. 14: If you want the credits to appear over a black background, tick the Over black tick box" width="168" height="182" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig. 14: If you want the credits to appear over a black
      background, tick the Over black tick box</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click <strong>preview</strong> to view the title you have chosen in
        the Preview Window.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig15.jpg" alt="Fig 15: Click preview to view the title in the Preview Window" width="400" height="250" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 15: Click preview to view the title in the Preview
      Window</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can change the duration that your credit shows using the speed
        slider. (You will be able to see your changes directly played in the
        Preview Window.) Remember to make sure you leave your titles and any
        other text, such as questions, on the screen long enough for your on-line
        audience to read them. </li>
      <li>You can change the size of the font using the font size selector. (You
        will be able to see your changes directly played in the Preview Window.)</li>
      <li>Drag your chosen title into the timeline; for example, at the beginning
        or your clips in the Clip Viewer/Timeline bar. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig16.jpg" alt="Fig 16: Drag your chosen title into the front of the timeline" width="400" height="135" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 16: Drag your chosen title into the front of the timeline</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you want to view all your clips together, one after the other, to
        get a feel for how the clips are working together, click around the grey
        area below the Playhead bar. You will see the blue bar change to show
        the clips separated by tiny line breaks. Click on an individual clip
        to view it in the Preview Window.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig17.jpg" alt="Fig 17: Click around the grey area below the Playhead bar to show the clips separated by tiny line breaks" width="400" height="73" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 17: Click around the grey area below the Playhead
      bar to show the clips separated by tiny line breaks</p>
    <p>Creating your own credits and titles in Photoshop and then importing them
      into iMovie is another option.</p>
<h3>    vii) Creating black blank spaces:</h3>    <p>In iMovie:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go back to your <strong>Titles</strong> options.</li>
      <li>Select your <strong>Centered Title</strong>.</li>
      <li>This time, remove the text you entered in the text box. </li>
      <li>Drag this empty <strong>Title</strong> into the Clip Viewer/Timeline
        the same way you did for your captions/credits. This time you will simply
        have a black space. You can use these black spaces between clips to fade
        in and out of each clip.</li>
      <li>Reduce the duration of this inserted black clip by cropping it in your
        Preview Window the same way you would for any other clip.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase the duration of this inserted black clip by copying it and
        pasting it next to itself. You can do this very easily using the copy
        / paste short cuts on your keyboard. Select the clip you want to copy &ndash; copy
        it &ndash; highlight the clip that sits just in front (to the left) of
        where you want the copied clip to fit into, and paste it in. The copied
        clip will now be to the right of the clip you highlighted.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>    viii) Consider adding cut-aways:</h3>    <p>It is a good idea to add cut-away images if you are interviewing artists
      and you want to show good images of the work they are talking about. Cut-aways
      are also useful if you want to keep the audio but not the filmed footage,
      and you need an image to insert into the gap.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>in iMovie HD, you can access pictures in iPhoto and add them to your
        timeline. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also drag and drop images from anywhere on your hard disk into
      the iMovie HD timeline: iMovie HD will format the images to fit with the
      format of your video. You can change the duration they show on the screen
      by cropping the image clip as you would any clip. Similarly, you can extend
      the duration by copying and pasting the clip to make it twice, three times
      or four times as long.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Return to your Clips menu.</li>
      <li>Drag and drop the image into your Clips Panel and then drag it into
        your timeline as and where you want. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consider making a still image from a video clip:</p>
    <p>You may have a clip that contains an image you want to use to illustrate
      your interview. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select the image in the clip using the <strong>Playhead marker.</strong> </li>
      <li>Go to the <strong>Edit</strong> and <strong>Create Still Frame. </strong>The
        still clip appears in the Clips Pane.</li>
      <li>Adjust the duration that the still image will appear - to increase
        or decrease how long a picture appears in the video, use the <strong>Duration
        slider</strong> at the top of the Photos pane and then click <strong>Apply.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>At this stage, you might want to consider importing images from other
      sources such as image folders on your shared folders or images saved to
      your desktop&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simply add images from your shared folders or desk top by dragging
        them into your time line.&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
<h3>    ix) Consider adding transitions between clips:</h3>    <p>This is useful for creating a smooth join between each clip. It enables
      you to fade in and out of shots and prevents sharp cut offs and abrupt
      edits. iMovie HD has a few different transitions, but the best suited here
      is a straight fade in and out between clips. Fortunately you can also add
      transitions between video clips and still images.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select your clip to add your <strong>fade in</strong> or your <strong>fade
          out</strong> (to apply the transition to or from) then click the <strong>Transitions</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig18.jpg" alt="Fig 18: Click around the grey area below the Playhead bar to show the clips separated by tiny line breaks" width="232" height="500" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 18: Click around the grey area below the Playhead
      bar to show the clips separated by tiny line breaks</p>
    <p>Preview the transition in the Preview Window. You will see the transitions
      icon sitting in between the two clips. </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig19.jpg" alt="Fig 19: the transitions icon sitting in between the two clips" width="400" height="95" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 19: the transitions icon sitting in between the two
      clips</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Speed up or slow down the transition using the <strong>speed slider </strong>underneath
        the Preview Window. Note that if you make a change to the speed of the
        dissolve, click <strong>update</strong> to save your change.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>    x) Remember to Save your footage and archive it:</h3>    <p>It is very important to save your footage carefully (the original footage
      too) so that it can be re-used if need be. Save it by burning it to DVD
      (useful if you want to play it in the gallery space on a DVD player). One
      way of saving your video interview to archive is to send it back into the
      video camera and save it to a tape. This gives you a high quality copy
      for your archive. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Insert a new, recordable tape in your camcorder.</li>
      <li>Switch the camcorder to <strong>VTR mode</strong> and connect it to
        your Mac via the FireWire lead (make sure the Playhead in your timeline
        is at the beginning of the video).</li>
      <li>Set it to <strong>Playback mode.</strong> </li>
      <li>In iMovie go to the <strong>Menu</strong> and select <strong>File and
          Share.</strong> </li>
      <li>Choose the <strong>video camera icon</strong> that appears along the
        top of the pop-up box. </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Share </strong>and the video is sent back into the video
        camera where it records it on the new tape.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This copy is recorded in real time, so your 6-minute interview will take
      6 minutes to copy over to the tape.</p>
    <p>You can burn a copy of your interview to DVD using iDVD. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click the <strong>iDVD</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>iDVD will allow you to add chapter markers to your video (this is useful
      if you want to separate the different questions asked during the interview).
      However if the interview or video is relatively short, you may not want
      to bother doing this. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Move the Playhead to where you want the new scene to begin (the next
        chapter) in the timeline and click the <strong>Add chapter</strong> button. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Click the <strong>Create iDVD project</strong> button to burn a copy to
      DVD.<strong></strong></p>
    <h2>Step 4. Sign Off With Artist (Copyright And Approval) </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always leave sufficient time to get the artist's approval before launching
        the vodcast. This includes leaving time to implement any changes that
        you agree on. </li>
      <li>The simplest way to get sign off is by posting the vodcast on a hidden
        or secure section of your Internet site and sending the artist the url.
        Before you do this, you should check that the artist is able to access
        the Internet and has the right software installed (eg Flash or Real Player). </li>
      <li>Another option (which can be time efficient if the artist is local)
        is to sit down with the artist and review the content together. Edits
        can then be made and approved immediately. </li>
      <li>Approval from the artist should ultimately be put in writing. However,
        an e-mail will usually do, especially if no artworks have been included
        in the footage; they&nbsp; could require additional clearances. </li>
      <li>A simple form can be created for this purpose, and ideally perpetual
        rights should be sought to ensure the content is available in the long
        term. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 5. Launch And Link (Promote And Enjoy) </h2>
    <p>Before you launch your new artist video on-line, you will need to encode
      it into a suitable video file. &lsquo;AVS Video Converter&rsquo; is a very
      cheap piece of software ($20 to dowload it on-line). So assuming you have
      downloaded your encoding software onto your Mac here is what you do next
      to export your DV file,&nbsp;or QuickTime Movie file (.mov) in iMovie:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select <strong>File</strong> and <strong>Export</strong> </li>
      <li>Select <strong>Full Quality</strong> in the drop down and also select <strong>QuickTime </strong>and
        save it to a folder. Anywhere you choose is fine. </li>
      <li>Open AVS Video Converter (or equivalent) and upload your saved file. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Encoding settings</strong> (this example is for RealPlayer)</p>
    <h3>Narrowband:</h3>
    <p>In general on a Web site it is advisable to have one version optimized
      for a 56k modem, because stats show that 40 &ndash; 50% of your audience,
      (largely international) still access your site from a modem. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clip speed 24 kbps</li>
      <li>Audio Rate 8.5 kbps</li>
      <li>Frame rate 15 fps</li>
      <li>Frame size 240 x 180</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Broadband:</h3>
    <p>Also provide a higher quality broadband version. Optimize for about 256k.
      That means that the lowest domestic version broadband can still view the
      video smoothly. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clip speed 225 kbs</li>
      <li>Audio Rate 44 kbps</li>
      <li>Frame rate 25 fps</li>
      <li>frame size 640 x 480 or 320 x 240</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If there is a lot of movement and a complex background in the video, then
      a smaller frame size of 320 x 240 would be more suitable. </p>
    <h3>Next, you need to upload your files to your streaming server.</h3>
    <p>This involves two files: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>One, a <strong>.ra</strong> file, which is the audio/video file that
        you&nbsp;upload to your streaming server.</li>
      <li>The other, a <strong>.ram</strong> file, which is created in notepad
        and which links to&nbsp;the location of the&nbsp;<strong>.ra</strong> file
        on the streaming server. The <strong>.ram </strong>file will be uploaded
        to the ordinary server (i.e. where all the html pages are). </li>
      <li>If you want to put a link to the audio/video file&nbsp;from any&nbsp;html
        page, or if you want the audio/video embedded in an html page,&nbsp;you&nbsp;type
        the location of the&nbsp;<strong>.ram</strong> file into the html. Then
        when the page is accessed,&nbsp;this will automatically connect to the
        .ra file on the streaming server.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is a useful link to information on how to create a RAM file using
      notepad:</p>
    <p><a href="../http://www.irational.org/radio/radio_guide/ramfile.html" target="_blank">http://www.irational.org/radio/radio_guide/ramfile.html</a></p>
    <p>To save a notepad file as a .ram instead of a .txt, when it says 'Save
      As Type' in the drop down box, select 'All Files' instead of the default
      'Text Documents'; then, when naming the file, just give it the extension &quot;.ram&quot;. </p>
    <h3>From Streaming to On-Demand: Create a &ldquo;True&rdquo; Vodcast
        for Your Museum</h3>
    <p>The previous sections outlined the steps for creating and establishing
      streaming video on your Web site. Yet you are still a few steps away from
      being able to claim the title of a true vodcaster. Only when you have sent
      videos over an RSS feed - essentially providing on-demand video - have
      you established a <em>true</em> vodcast. </p>
    <p>Streaming or downloading video through the methods we have described thus
      far is a one-time event. You follow the link, you play the video, end of
      story. Vodcasting works on a subscription basis: you sign up for a vodcast,
      and each time a new episode is released, you are notified and can opt to
      have it streamed your way.</p>
    <p>The technology behind vodcasting is identical to that which makes up podcasting.
      The only difference is that you are distributing video, rather than audio
      files. The key to vodcasting is to establish an RSS (Real Simple Syndication)
      feed, a page of instruction that can be read by iTunes (or other subscription
      programs). By preparing your movies properly and creating the right feed,
      you can offer your audience video on demand through an application familiar
      to us all: iTunes (version 4.9 or higher), a program that supports playback
      of local and streamed video. </p>
    <h3>How to go about creating and distributing a vodcast of your own:</h3>
    <h4>The Skeleton Crew: A Bare Bones List of the Tools You Need to Get You
      Started</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Your video(s)</li>
      <li>Space on your institution&rsquo;s Web server, or space on a hosted
        server to host your media</li>
      <li>Space to host the XML file that allows iTunes to access your video</li>
      <li>QuickTime Pro 7 (for compressing your movie to optimally play in iTunes)-
        this costs $29.99 and is available for download from the Apple Store
        Web site. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>i) Create, Optimize and Export
    </h4>
    <p>The steps above outlined how to produce and edit your own media with the
      help of iMovie. Now that you have your media, you must optimize it for
      playback over a subscription feed: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open your iMovie film using the <strong>Export</strong> command and
        save the film in <strong>H.264 video codec</strong> format. H.264 is
        a relatively new video codec format and delivers stunning quality at
        remarkably low data rates.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>ii) Compress your file
    </h4>
    <p>You need to compress the video so that it plays optimally over your vodcast
      feed. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open your film in <strong>QuickTime Player Pro 7</strong>. </li>
      <li>Choose <strong>Export</strong> from the File menu, and in the <strong>Save
          Exported File As</strong> dialogue box, select <strong>Movie to MPEG-4</strong> from
          the pop-up menu. </li>
      <li>Click the <strong>Options</strong> button, and in the <strong>MP4 Export
          Settings</strong> select <strong>MP4</strong> from the <strong>File
          Format</strong> pop-up menu. </li>
      <li>In the Video Format pop-up menu, select <strong>H.264</strong>. To
        keep your file size smaller, select a modest image size; for example,
        240 x 180 frame size with a frame rate of 15 fps. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="dance.fig20.jpg" alt="Fig 20: MP4 Export Settings" width="419" height="396" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 20: MP4 Export Settings </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click the <strong>Audio</strong>tab and make sure that <strong>AAC-LC
          (Music)</strong> is selected in the Audio Format pop-up menu. Select
          a modest data rate from that pop-up menu (48 kbps, for example). You
          will save even more space if you choose Mono from the Channels pop-up
          menu and an output sample rate of 32.000 kHz. </li>
      <li>Click the <strong>Streaming</strong> tab to enable the <strong>Enable
          Streaming</strong> option. </li>
      <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> and then click <strong>Save</strong> in the <strong>Save
          Exported File As </strong>window to compress your video. Compressing
          the video could take quite a while if your video&rsquo;s duration was
          long and the file is large.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>iii) Put it on a server
    </h4>
    <p>Work with your Web team to create a &lsquo;home&rsquo; for your films
      on the Web server. This is the directory in which you will drop your compressed
      movie files, and from which your movie will be delivered to the world. </p>
    <p>If for some reason you are unable to host your own media there are a number
      of services that will host your videos for you. There are many free services,
      but most come with a few hitches such as limited file size capacity and/or
      the inability to keep your files private. However, you can easily find
      low-cost hosting solutions which offer both privacy and unlimited (or astronomically
      high) file capacity.</p>
    <p>i) Some suggested hosting solutions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>OurMedia (<a href="../http://www.ourmedia.org/" target="_blank">http://www.ourmedia.org</a>)
        - Provides &ldquo;free storage and free bandwidth for your videos, audio
        files, photos, text or software forever. No catches.&rdquo;&hellip;Except
        that your video will be shared publicly with others.</li>
      <li>YouTube (<a href="../http://www.youtube.org/" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.org</a>)
        - Free hosting, but everything you upload will be made public.</li>
      <li>Google Video (<a href="../http://video.google.com/" target="_blank">http://video.google.com</a>)
        - According to Google&rsquo;s Web site, this service allows you to &quot;upload
        as many videos to Google Video as you like, without any size or length
        limitations.&quot; However, at the moment, they do not allow private
        video.</li>
      <li>Veoh (<a href="../http://www.veoh.com/" target="_blank">http://www.veoh.com</a>) - There
        is no file size limit with this server. This is a P2P sharing platform
        where a short clip of up to 3 minutes is show-cased. Users then decide
        from that whether to download the rest of video.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      iv) Create and Post your XML file>
    </h4>
    <p>The XML file you create will allow iTunes to access your film. Essentially
      there are two options to choose from:</p>
    <p>i) Employ a feed generator to create the XML file. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Feed Burner (<a href="../http://www.feedburner.com/" target="_blank">www.feedburner.com</a>)</li>
      <li>FeedBurner (<a href="../http://www.feedforall.com/" target="_blank">www.feedforall.com</a>)      &ndash; A
        low cost program that takes the coding completely out of the process.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ii) Manually code your feed. To guide you, we have provided sample XML
      code below. Use the text as a model template and write your own code into
      a plain text (TextEdit or Notepad) document, replacing the example entries
      with entries that match your needs (for example, SFMOMA Video Casts should
      be replaced with the title of your vodcast feed. Save the file with the
      .xml extension - vodcasts.xml, for example - and your feed is ready to
      go!</p>

    <p class="code">&nbsp; &lt;/channel&gt;</p>
    <p class="code">&lt;/rss&gt;</p>
    <p>Note that you will need to fill in details about the length of your film
      in the <strong>itunes:duration</strong> area of the xml file. An easy method
      to determine the length of your film is to open it in QuickTime Player
      and look under &ldquo;<strong>Window&gt;Show Movie Info</strong>&rdquo;.
      Enter the duration as <strong>HH:MM:SS - 00:01:32</strong> for 1 minute
      and 32 seconds, for example. </p>
    <p>Place the XML file on your Web server.</p>
    <h4>v) Check it in iTunes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Launch iTunes (version 4.9 or later) and select <strong>Subscribe to
          Podcast</strong> from the <strong>Advanced </strong>menu. </li>
      <li>Enter the feed URL - in other words, the pathname on the Web server
        where your XML file resides (for the SFMOMA site: <a href="../http://www.sfmoma.org/rss/videocasts.xml" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org/rss/videocasts.xml</a>&rdquo;). </li>
      <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. An entry for your vodcast should appear
        in the Podcast playlist within iTunes&rsquo; main window and the video
        will begin downloading to your computer.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>Play</strong> button and the video will play in the
        small video window in the lower left corner of the iTunes window. Click
        on this window and the video appears in a larger, separate window. Click <strong>Control-click</strong> (Mac)
        or <strong>Right-click</strong> (Windows) on this window and choose <strong>Full
        Screen</strong> to view the video at full screen. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>vi) Add your vodcast to the iTunes Podcast Directory</h4>
    <p>Adding your vodcast to the searchable iTunes podcast directory is a simple
      way to publicize your videos to the public. Although in this workshop we
      focus exclusively on vodcasts, iTunes treats all video and audio streams
      under the rubric of &lsquo;podcasts&rsquo;. Therefore, vodcasts will be
      listed under the iTunes podcast directory. The directory offers tens of
      thousands of vodcasts and podcasts, produced by both big names and independent
      creators. Luckily, both the &lsquo;big&rdquo; and &lsquo;little&rsquo; guys
      get equal footing in the podcast directory. </p>
    <p>To submit your vodcast feed: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to <strong>iTunes&gt;Music Store</strong>. Click on <strong>Podcasts</strong> under
        the <strong>iTunes Store</strong>. Under <strong>Learn More</strong> you
        will see a link to <strong>Submit a Podcast</strong>. The form is relatively
        straightforward. It is useful to keep your vodcast XML page open, and
        copy and paste the data directly into the form. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      vii) Next Steps: Broadcasting Your Videos on YouTube.com
    </h4>
    <p>For some time now corporations, the entertainment industry, and advertisers
      have recognized the power of user-generated video sites, of which the reigning
      king is YouTube (<a href="../http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com</a>). </p>
    <p>Increasingly, non-profits and cultural institutions have realized the
      potential of YouTube as a cost-free way to share content with a wide audience.
      Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (<a href="../http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=ybcavideo" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=ybcavideo</a>)
      has designed a YouTube &lsquo;channel&rsquo; featuring a variety of media
      related to their current exhibitions and public programs. Users can play
      back streaming videos or subscribe to the YBCA video stream and get alerts
      as new content becomes available. </p>
    <p>This is a relatively simple, efficient, and exciting way for museums and
      cultural institutions to reach wider audiences, and perhaps win new converts!</p>
