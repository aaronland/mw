    <p class="abstractText">In
        2002, the New Zealand Government funded the Reference Group within the
        Ministry for Culture and Heritage to create a new Encyclopedia of New
        Zealand. Written and created specifically for the Web, this publication
        is being produced on-line progressively over a nine-year period: access
        to the Web site is free of charge. Te Ara &ndash; The Encyclopedia of
        New Zealand will contain approximately 2.5 million words, 25, 000 media
        objects and around 1,000 entries. &lsquo;Te Ara&rsquo; in Maori means &lsquo;the
        pathway&rsquo;, and this Encyclopedia will offer many pathways to understanding
        New Zealand. It will eventually be a comprehensive guide to the country&rsquo;s
        peoples, natural environment, history, culture, economy, institutions
        and society. Te Ara will be structured around nine themes, appearing
        progressively between 2005 and 2012. They include <em>New Zealanders</em> (published
        2005), <em>Earth Sea and Sky</em> (published
        2006), and seven others still to come. </p>
    <p class="abstractText">Photographs,
        sounds, moving images, documents, graphs and maps are combined with text
        in Te Ara. On average there is one media object for every 100 words.&nbsp; An
        important feature of the site is its Maori content. There are currently
        few reliable and accessible reference sources on Maori; the Maori history,
        culture, science and stories contained in Te Ara will be a significant
        contribution to an understanding of New Zealand.</p>
    <p class="abstractText">Te
        Ara combines short essays with a variety of multimedia additions in an
        exciting, entertaining and instructive way. Links provide pathways to
        the digital collections of libraries, archives and museums around the
        country, and the project has helped to encourage nationwide digitization
        of information. Te Ara also allows for the inclusion of community contributions
        such as photographs, oral histories, or updates of information.</p>

                <h1>New Zealand: A Brief Overview</h1>
                New Zealand stretches 1,500 kilometers across latitudes
      34&deg; to 47&deg; South, 1,600 kilometers from Australia. There are three
      islands, the North (113,729 square kilometers), South (150,437 square kilometers),
      and Stewart (1,680 square kilometers). New Zealand was one of the last
      land masses to be settled - the first people of New Zealand (the Maori)
      arrived during the Pacific migrations of 1250&ndash;1300 AD. The first
      European to discover New Zealand was Dutchman Abel Tasman in 1642, but
      it was not until the voyages of Englishman James Cook in the eighteenth
      century that the country was mapped and documented, preparing the way for
      further European exploration and later colonization. Major migration to
      New Zealand began with English settlers from around 1840, and peoples from
      Europe, the Pacific and Asia followed. Today New Zealand has a culturally
      diverse population of 4,167,746. The two official languages of the country
      are English and Maori. To find out more, go to <a href="../http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealandInBrief/en">http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealandInBrief/en</a>

    <h1>Te Ara &ndash; The Encyclopedia Of New Zealand:&nbsp; An Introduction</h1>
    <p>In 2003
        the New Zealand Government granted funding for the development of a new
        Encyclopedia of New Zealand to be created within the Ministry for Culture
        and Heritage. The only previous comprehensive encyclopedia of the country
        had been produced in print form in 1966, and an update was deemed timely.
        Headed by New Zealand historian Jock Phillips, the project was immediately
        conceived as an on-line creation. The precursors to this project were
        the successful on-line publication of New Zealand's <em>Dictionary of
        New Zealand Biography</em> (<a href="../http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/">http://www.dnzb.govt.nz</a> )
        and another popular Ministry initiative, nzhistory.net (<a href="../http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/">http://www.nzhistory.net.nz</a> ). </p>
    <p>Te Ara &ndash; the
        Encyclopedia of New Zealand is the first national encyclopedia in the
        world to be developed especially for the Web. Te Ara means 'the pathway'
        in the Maori language, and the project is providing pathways to knowledge.
        The entries are being published on-line progressively, in thematic groupings,
        over a nine-year period. The possibilities of on-line publication have
        allowed Te Ara to develop as an exciting multi-media project, incorporating
        not only written text but photos, maps, sounds and video. &nbsp;Te Ara
        will be a gateway into the country&rsquo;s cultural treasures &ndash; the
        images, sounds, objects, documents and films in regional repositories
        and private holdings, the special places of New Zealand and the people
        who forged New Zealand's identity. An important feature of Te Ara is its Maori content. The Maori perspective is presented
        with each theme, and entries with substantial Maori content are available
        in the Maori language. Some of the entries are being published, with
        illustrations, in print. It is envisaged that Te Ara will become the
        first port of call for reliable information about New Zealand: its land,
        environment, peoples, culture, history and identity. It is free to all
        users.</p>
    <h1>Initial
        Development And Implementation</h1>
    <p>After
        funding had been confirmed for the project, a small staff (including
        the General Editor, Production Manager, Managing Editor and Manager,
        Web Resources) spent a year designing the structure and content. Extensive
        use was made of reference based sites already on the Web (models such
        as the BBC and PBS, and numerous national and international library and
        museum sites were carefully examined). Focus groups and experts, both
        national and international, were consulted.&nbsp; By the end of this
        preparatory year, a sequence of themes and a model for an entry had been
        developed. This model was published and trialed on another Ministry site, http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/.</p>
    <p>In addition
        to this work, three advisory committees were established: a general committee,
        a Maori committee, and a repository committee. IT partners were enlisted
        after a thorough process of tender and proof of concept. Today these
        partners include Shift, Optimation, OneSquared,
        and the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre. A
        branding exercise was undertaken &ndash; the resulting choice received
        a national design award. Finally, entries for the first theme were commissioned
        and an in-house staff were appointed and trained. </p>

    <h1>Thematic Structure</h1>
    <p>At the
        start of the project a decision was made to develop the publication thematically
        rather than following the traditional alphabetic encyclopedia model.
        This allows for the grouping of expertise and cross-disciplinary engagement.
        The cross-searchability of the Web adds value to this model, enabling
        users to connect seemingly disparate subjects in one theme to another
        through key search terms or phrases.</p>
    <p>Te Ara's
        themes are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">New
        Zealanders</strong> &ndash; the
        people of New Zealand, and their origins (published 2005). This theme
        includes entries about the major iwi (tribes) of New Zealand and the
        settler communities who came later. It is the first comprehensive guide
        to the iwi of New Zealand to be published. </li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Earth,
        Sea and Sky</strong> &ndash; the
        natural environment of New Zealand including climate, earthquakes and
        sea life (published 2006).</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">The
        Bush</strong> &ndash; landforms,
        flora and fauna, including native birds, native plants and fungi and
        native animals (to be published September 2007).</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">The
        Settled Landscape</strong> &ndash; how
        the New Zealand people live in, use and change their environment, including
        topics to do with agriculture and horticulture. Work has begun on this
        theme &ndash; an entry list has been created and the new theme editor
        appointed. </li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Trade
        and Exchange</strong> &ndash; the
        economy, business and city life.</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Nation</strong> &ndash; systems
        of government and symbols of national identity.</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Daily
        Life</strong> &ndash; the
        customs, leisure activities and beliefs that make New Zealand unique.</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Creative
        Impulses</strong> &ndash; arts,
        culture, invention and innovation.</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Places</strong> &ndash; A
        guide to the regions within New Zealand including 22 regions from North
        Cape to the Bluff. Each of the entries consists of two parts: an overview
        covering each region&rsquo;s geology, natural history, people, culture
        and history; and a complete gazetteer of the area including brief descriptions
        of the major localities and their natural features. This theme is being
        developed over the entire period of the project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also
        included in the Web site is the Encyclopaedia of New Zealand (1966).
        This print encyclopedia was double-keyed in India and digitised with
        the assistance of the Electronic Text Centre at Victoria University of
        Wellington for publication on-line. It includes 600 line drawings, maps
        and graphs, and has been reformatted to fit Te Ara's structure. Although
        it is outdated, it is still a valuable reference work and was seen as
        the solution to providing as much comprehensive information about New
        Zealand as possible while Te Ara developed. Once the new project is complete
        the 1966 <em>Encyclopaedia</em> will
        offer an interesting time capsule, enabling users to click from current
        thought to the ideas and views held in 1966. To ensure that users know
        this should be considered an &lsquo;historic&rsquo; resource, the design
        of the pages to reflects its origins.</p>
    <p>Another
        feature of the site is the <em>Dictionary of New Zealand Biography</em> which
        contains information about the lives of over 3,000 people who were active
        between 1769 and 1960. Although this is currently a separate Web site,
        it will soon be fully integrated into the Te Ara site.</p>

    <h2>Format and Content</h2>
    <p>Each
        theme is divided into between two and ten sub-themes (broader topics)
        and approximately 100-110 entries (specific subjects). Depending on the
        subject these entries usually contain 1000 &ndash; 2000 words. The entries
        in turn are divided into sub-entries of around 500 words (a little larger
        than one computer screen) for ease of accessibility. Each sub-entry is
        accompanied by up to five captioned resources (photos, artworks, ephemera,
        original documents, maps, diagrams, sound files or moving images) intended
        to add value to the text or enable an author to expand on a point that
        could not be covered sufficiently within the word limit. Relevant annotated
        links are also supplied for the on-line <em>Dictionary of New Zealand
        Biography</em>.</p>
    <p>Each
        entry has a home page with a 'hero' image evocative of the content of
        the entry. A short blurb entices users into the entry and a link to a
        'short story' for younger readers is available from this page. If an
        entry has considerable Maori content, an option is provided to read it
        in the Maori language. </p>

        FirstPeoplesInMaoriTradition/en</a></p>
    <h2>Community Contributions: What's My Story?</h2>
    <p>Because
        we are keen to give the broader Te Ara community a voice, an appeal is
        made regularly to the New Zealand public to provide community contributions
        on various subjects related to the theme under development. </p>
    <p>The
        first of these appeals accompanied the theme about the people of New
        Zealand. Members of the public were asked to send in personal accounts
        about the &lsquo;voyage out&rsquo; to New Zealand.&nbsp; A variety of
        contributions were received, from diary accounts of travel to New Zealand
        in the nineteenth century to recent memories of migration to New Zealand. </p>
    <p>The
        second theme included a number of entries about New Zealand&rsquo;s natural
        hazards. An appeal for 'disaster' stories elicited contributions about
        tsunamis, earthquakes and floods &ndash; real experiences often accompanied
        by images of the events. Another appeal was made for contributions about
        beachcombing &ndash; unusual findings on New Zealand&rsquo;s extensive
        coastline. Tales of encountering everything from a severed hand to a
        sea snake (New Zealand does not naturally have any snakes in its environment)
        were received. It is hoped that the latest appeal for stories about people&rsquo;s
        experience in New Zealand&rsquo;s great outdoors (entitled colloquially &lsquo;Bush
        yarns&rsquo;) will generate the same kind of interest and continue to
        add to the human dimension of the site.</p>
    <p>These
        contributions are sent in to Te Ara by the public in both digital and
        hard copy. A selection is made, edited to fit Te Ara house style, and
        published on-line. Te Ara is presently examining other possibilities
        for user interaction with the site.</p>

        TheVoyageOut/9/en</a> </p>
    <h2>A Brief Te Ara Fact File </h2>
    <p>When
        the project is finished, around 2011, Te Ara will contain the following
        elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number
        of entries: 1,150</li>
      <li>Number
        of words: 4-5 million</li>
      <li>Number
        of digital resources: 26,000, including</li>
      <li>20,000
        photos, artworks, cartoons</li>
      <li>2,500
        maps, graphs, diagrams</li>
      <li>1,000
        music and speech recordings</li>
      <li>1,500
        articles, poems, stories</li>
      <li>1,000
        film clips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>As a
        national encyclopedia, Te Ara&rsquo;s task is to provide a variety of
        pathways to accommodate many different people with diverse needs and
        interests. It meets these requirements in a number of ways, as follows.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Younger
        users and speakers of English as a second language:</em> Every
        entry has a &lsquo;short story&rsquo;, a brief (200-300 words), accessible
        summary of the content written in lively, user-friendly language. This
        is targeted specifically at the elementary school-aged audience.</li>
      <li><em>Secondary
        school students and general New Zealand readers:</em> The
        main entries are aimed at a 15-year-old reading level. Plain, everyday
        words are used. If technical terms are needed they are clearly explained
        in context. An exception is the use of names for flora and fauna: the
        scientific, Maori and common names are given.</li>
      <li><em>Maori
        audience:</em> All
        entries with extensive Maori content are translated into te reo Maori
        (the Maori language). There are now a number of total immersion Maori
        language schools in New Zealand and Te Ara needs to ensure that it
        is of value to this sector. A button at the top of each page allows
        the user to switch from one language to the other.</li>
      <li><em>International
        audience:</em> The
        Web allows Te Ara to reach a vast international audience, and as such
        it is an important tool for telling others about New Zealand and attracting
        foreign tourists. With this market in mind, a clickable glossary is
        provided so that users can understand New Zealand vocabulary - like
        Maori words in common New Zealand usage (e.g. 'Pakeha': a term used
        to describe a non-Maori person, usually of British ethnic origin or
        background) or colloquial expressions (e.g. bach &ndash; meaning a
        cottage or holiday home).</li>
      <li><em>Scholars</em>:
        The Te Ara entry is designed to take users to the frontiers of received
        knowledge about a subject. Entries take account of recent research, discoveries
        and different perspectives. Where there has been scholarly debate on
        a topic or diverse interpretations of it, this is indicated, even if
        only briefly. Where direct quotations are used, a click brings up the
        full reference. At the end of each entry there are suggestions for further
        sources, and there is an annotated list of relevant Web sites to allow
        users to discover more. Some resources include primary material such
        as documents (as images or PDFs) or statistical material for users to
        explore if required. </li>
      <li><em>The
        visual non-reader:</em> An
        image and media trail has been created to encourage reluctant readers
        or those who explore their world visually to interact with the site.
        By browsing from one media item to another, a user is able to obtain
        something of the sense of an entry.</li>

          and Consultation </h3>
    <p>A list
        of entry subjects for each theme is prepared by the Theme Editor in consultation
        with the General Editor, Te Ara staff, interested groups and Te Ara advisory
        committees.&nbsp; The General Editor and Theme Editor then commission
        entries from internal and external writers. </p>
    <h3>Writing and Checking</h3>
    <p>The
        General Editor and Theme Editor receive the entries, read them and if
        necessary return them to writers for amendment. </p>
    <p>A small
        team of writers within the Te Ara office of the Ministry for Culture
        and Heritage has created on average 40% of the encyclopedia text, depending
        on the theme being written. The remainder is written by experts out of
        house. The externally-written entries are checked and restructured into
        encyclopedia style by writers in-house. The Writing Team has a small
        core staff which is augmented by experts according to the theme being
        worked on. For the entries about the people of New Zealand, the team
        was predominantly New Zealand historians. When the themes about New Zealand's
        natural environment began, the team was changed and slightly expanded
        to include a geologist, botanist, zoologist and ornithologist. The appointments
        for the fourth theme are about to be made, and an expert on New Zealand
        agriculture has recently been employed to lead the team.</p>
    <h3>Resource Research</h3>
    <p>Once
        an entry has been written and checked, it is allocated to a Resource
        Researcher to locate other media. Researchers need well developed research
        ability, a knowledge of research institutions, both within New Zealand
        and international, and excellent PR skills. The budget for resources
        is not large, but the possibilities for the inclusion of material are
        seemingly endless. It is a constant juggling act to make sure that the
        best material is included within the financial constraints of the project.
        To date approximately 9,000 resources have been gathered and optimized
        for publication. </p>
    <p>The
        final choice of material to be added to an entry is made at a meeting
        involving the Writer/Checker, Theme Editor, General Editor and Manager,
        Web Resources. After this meeting the Resource Researcher then locates
        and orders resources and prepares the caption document which is given
        to the Writer/Checker for the writing of captions. An&nbsp; SQL database
        is used to manage the chosen resources, their ordering, optimization
        and final publication on-line. While a distributed model for the collection
        and display of other media was considered in the early stages of the
        project, it soon became clear that collecting and optimizing digital
        copies of material in house was the most expedient solution. The SQL
        database records the provenance of all resources and manages the reference
        information, including links back to institutions, which appears below
        captions.</p>
    <p>Creating
        and maintaining links with potential suppliers of material is an important
        part of the Resource Team's work. An advisory committee that included
        managers of libraries and museums from around the country assisted with
        initial planning for the team. They recommended that personal contact
        was important in setting up lasting relationships. As a result, members
        of the team traveled around New Zealand &ndash; a Te Ara 'roadshow' &ndash; to
        spread the word about the developing project. The aim was to obtain buy-in
        from as many institutions and individuals as possible, with a view to
        obtaining the best resources available to enhance entries, as well as
        finding new material to add to the published scholarship. At the beginning
        of the project very few institutions within New Zealand were digitally
        aware &ndash; repositories in smaller centers often had no knowledge
        at all of the possibilities of the developing Web. With this in mind
        a portable digital kit was created &ndash; a small scanner and lap top
        computer &ndash; which could be taken by hand to smaller institutions
        in out-of-the-way locations. This not only enabled the project to publish
        new material but alsogave some smaller institutions an early presence
        on the Web. Te Ara, through these resources, now provides pathways to
        the hard copy and digital collections of museums and libraries around
        the country. The work Te Ara has undertaken so far has encouraged the
        process of digitization in New Zealand. </p>

    <p>The
        project has been fortunate to develop close relationships with the major
        heritage institutions of New Zealand, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The
        Alexander Turnbull Library &ndash; a national repository containing a
        significant collection of New Zealand photos, artworks, ephemera and
        manuscripts.</li>
      <li>Television
        New Zealand &ndash; New Zealand&rsquo;s major television provider.</li>
      <li>Archives
        New Zealand &ndash; guardians of the history of New Zealand&rsquo;s official
        institutions and also a significant historical film and photograph collection.</li>
      <li>GNS
        Science, Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences &ndash; New Zealand&rsquo;s
        providers of earth science research and consultancy.</li>

        ENZ-Resources/Standard/2/en</a> </p>
    <p>As with
        any publication project, the principles of permission, copyright and
        moral rights need to be carefully considered. Before any material is
      published on-line, a thorough check is made to ensure that all rights have
      been cleared. Te Ara has now appointed a dedicated Rights Administrator
      to manage other media rights. In addition, one member of the Resource Team
        has expertise in the Maori environment and is charged with ensuring that
        appropriate consultation is undertaken before any material specifically
        associated with an iwi (tribe) is used. </p>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>Once
        the Resource Team has allocated resources to an entry, draft ideas for
        maps, graphs and diagrams are prepared and given to the Design Team.
        The project is fortunate to have talented young designers who are constantly
        working to develop new and creative ways to produce diagrams, maps, viewable
        imagery and primary material on-line.</p>
    <p>Macromedia
        Flash is used to create and deliver interactive maps, diagrams and viewers
        for zooming into larger images. This mechanism is also used to drive
        the audio-visual player designed for the site. Moving images are presented
        with high and low band width delivery options.</p>
    <p>The
        Design Team's duties include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Optimizing
        often poor quality images for best results on the Web.</li>
      <li>Thumbnailing
        each image individually to entice users to view the larger item.</li>
      <li>Visualizing
        the way historic material (e.g. hand written diaries, historic maps and
        the like) can be displayed to best effect in the Web environment.</li>
      <li>Enhancing
        the viewer experience of historic photos, allowing users to zoom in to
        portions of images that would otherwise be difficult to view in the limited
        real estate allowed by the Te Ara design. </li>
      <li>Creating
        new diagrams and maps using up-to-date research, enabling users to understand
        complex scientific concepts using the visual medium.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Editing and Production</h3>
    <p>While
        the resource and design work is underway, the entry (and accompanying
        captions) is passed to the Editing Team, who copyedit the entry and write
        a short story (for the younger audience) in consultation with the Writer/Checker.</p>
    <p>Design
        work for the entry is collated and finalized by the Web Designer. The
        text is then formatted and converted into XML by the Production Editor
        and uploaded to the staging server. </p>
    <p>The
        entry is returned to the external writer if appropriate (via a secure
        staging site) for comment, and an in-house review is also undertaken.
        Necessary amendments are made and the entry is finalized. </p>
    <p>The
        project has adopted open standards wherever possible to allow for future
        extensibility. Content is kept separate from presentation and source
        documents use XML mark-up. The presentation layers are based on HTML
        templates and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). XML is used to manage the
        links between non-textual resources, their captions, reference information
        and text. XML also enables the management of links between entries.</p>
    <p>The
        site includes Dublin Core Metadata elements to describe every entry.
        The decision was made early in the project to conform to appropriate
        standards, enabling future interoperatibility with other projects &ndash; essential
        for a project such as Te Ara. This decision has enabled Te Ara to participate
        in other initiatives within New Zealand and internationally. These presently
        include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Matapihi
        (<a href="../http://www.matapihi.govt.nz/">http://www.matapihi.govt.nz</a> ),
        a National Digital Forum (New Zealand) initiative hosted by the National
        Library of New Zealand. Matapihi (window) is a portal into a number of
        cultural institutions around New Zealand. It presently provides links
        to the digital collections of ten New Zealand cultural organizations.
        Results of searches on the site are displayed as thumbnails which lead
        to a larger version of the item on the Web site of the contributing organization.
        In the case of Te Ara, they lead to a link to the home page of an entry.</li>
      <li>Education
        Sector Federated Search Project, a combined initiative coordinated in
        New Zealand by the Ministry of Education. This is a federated search
        engine which searches across education-related collections in New Zealand
        and Australia. It includes National Library of New Zealand catalogues,
        Encyclopedia New Zealand, EdNA on-line, Australia, ABC on-line Australia,
        Culture and Recreation Portal Australia, Picture Australia, VOCED Australia,
        and MERLOT, U.S.A. (<a href="../http://www.esfs.govt.nz/dsm/esfs/search.html">http://www.esfs.govt.nz/dsm/esfs/search.html</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>How Has Te Ara Been Received?</h1>
    <h2>Web Statistics</h2>
    <p>By the
        end of December 2006, the Te Ara site had received over 1.5 million unique
        visitors. By the time the team returned from their summer break in January
        2007, a total of 2.2 million visitors had viewed the site.&nbsp; Around
        50% of users come from New Zealand, with ever-increasing numbers visiting
        from the United States. Of all international visitors, those accessing
        the site from the USA make up almost 70% of traffic.&nbsp; Australia
        and Great Britain (in that order) are the next most common countries
        of access. </p>
    <p>It appears
        that the site is reaching its target audience &ndash; traffic clearly
        dips during the New Zealand school holidays, and there is much evidence
        to suggest that the site is a favorite with the education community for
        teaching in the classroom and for homework research. </p>
    <h2>Awards</h2>
    <p>Te Ara
        has been the recipient of a number of awards. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em class="listwithbullets"><a href="../http://www.innovationawards.co.nz/index.htm"><em>BearingPoint

    </ul>
    <h1>Where To From Here?</h1>
    <p>Te Ara
        is always looking at ways to improve communication with its audience
        and maintains a keen interest in Web 2 developments.&nbsp; Ideas for
        more community interaction, including possible wikis, blogs, and the
        like, are being discussed. There are also numerous possibilities for
        the use of Te Ara on mobile devices. </p>
    <p>User
        testing has continued throughout the project. The results of this testing
        have been carefully examined, and small changes to the site are presently
        being made. A feedback mailbox has also been maintained. The responses
        received provide potential corrigenda and ideas about the way the site
        might develop. Often users have spent some time considering the way this
        encyclopedia written for the Web works for them. </p>
    <p>In the
        immediate future the home page is being re-developed to accommodate the
        ever-increasing number of themes being developed. Alternative ways of
        displaying resources are being explored, as are small changes to the
        design of each entry home page. There are also plans for better access
        to and design of the short story written for younger readers.</p>
    <p>In the
        fast moving world of Web technology, the possibilities for the ongoing
        development of Te Ara are seemingly infinite. We are limited only by
        the constraints of time and budget.</p>
