      <p class="abstract">The Andy Warhol Museum (TAWM) is one of the largest 
        single artist museums in the world. TAWM's mission is to use the art, 
        life and practice of Andy Warhol as a catalyst for public dialogue and 
        learning. Using a single artist approach can present a challenge that 
        many institutions with seemingly finite scopes, like TAWM, must address: 
        educators do not readily see the broader applications and opportunities 
        for learning available within these museum contexts. To help teachers 
        make connections between Warhol's life, work, commentary on popular culture 
        and diverse academic subjects, TAWM Education Department has developed 
        a new on-line resource for teachers: <em>The Warhol: Resources and Lessons</em>. 
        This new on-line effort emphasizes teaching across the humanities, crossing 
        disciplines, and encourages teachers to collaborate and create learning 
        experiences that help students understand the intertwining relationships 
        between history, pop culture, literature, music, visual arts, and the 
        media.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Andy Warhol Museum (TAWM) is one of the largest single artist museums 
      in the world and has been exploring popular culture through the lens of 
      Warhol's work, life and practice for more than a decade. Andy Warhol embraced 
      infinite creative processes, and his influence has made him one of the most 
      important artists of our time. Throughout the public programs, exhibitions, 
      and educational offerings, the museum's unique philosophy of using a single 
      artist's practice as a framework for learning has been very successful, 
      but it can also present a challenge. Like other institutions of concentrated 
      scope, the single artist focus of the Warhol can be perceived by the public 
      as finite. Educators do not readily see the broader applications and opportunities 
      for learning available within these museum contexts. A common expectation 
      is that the educational content of the Warhol is appropriate for only high 
      school or college visual arts teachers with a specific mandate to teach 
      Pop Art. But in fact, Warhol's rich life and work, as well as his strong 
      commentary on popular culture, make him an excellent topic for use in a 
      wide variety of academic subjects. To help teachers make these connections, 
      TAWM Education Department has developed a content rich Web site, <em>The 
      Warhol: Resources and Lessons, teaching across the humanities</em>, that 
      encourages teachers to explore, experiment, and collaborate across disciplines, 
      creating learning experiences that help students understand the relationships 
      between history, literature, pop culture, music, visual arts and the media.</p>
    <p>The Warhol site content draws from ten years of development work in educationally 
      driven exhibitions; artist residencies; school outreaches; teacher workshops; 
      public programs; interpretive labeling; and such printed teacher resources 
      as <em>Education News</em>. The Web site was born out of demand by audiences 
      for more resources. The museum wrote numerous grants applications to establish 
      funding for an on-line resource, receiving seed money, as well as a larger 
      grant from Alcoa Foundation. </p>
    <p>During the first stages of development, the Warhol had to refocus the site 
      to settle the push and pull between the aesthetic needs of the site to represent 
      a contemporary art museum and the utilitarian and text-based needs of teacher 
      users. They engaged University of Pittsburgh Center for Learning in Out 
      of School Environments (UPCLOSE) to evaluate the site while it was in development. 
      In a three-phase evaluation process, UPCLOSE presented feedback from the 
      target audience and education stakeholders to shape the development of the 
      site.</p>
    <p>This paper will review the three stages of user testing and implementation 
      of the findings into the final <em>Warhol: Resources and Lessons</em> Web 
      site. We draw from the experiences of working with teachers as authors and 
      collaborators to suggest heuristics for inter-disciplinary and visual arts 
      curriculum Web site development that can be used at other museums.</p>
    <h2 style="page-break-after:auto;">Background</h2>
    <p>TAWM worked from 2002 onward to expand the educational offerings, and the 
      museum's growth including on-line educational resources. The initial stages 
      were funded by smaller &quot;seed&quot; grants from W.L. Spencer Foundation 
      and Verizon. In 2005, in conjunction with a traveling exhibition to Russia<em>, 
      Andy Warhol: Artist of Modern Life,</em> TAWM secured funding from the Alcoa 
      Foundation to produce the interdisciplinary on-line curriculum in English 
      and Russian. The Alcoa Corporation had recently acquired aluminum fabricating 
      facilities in Russia, and the cultural and educational benefits of this 
      curriculum corresponded with their desire to bring technology and interdisciplinary 
      education to communities in Russian as well as in English speaking countries. 
      The Web site's educational goals were to expand the educational services 
      and role of TAWM locally, nationally, and internationally by developing 
      unique interdisciplinary on-line curriculum that models teaching and learning 
      in and through the arts using a single artist's work and practice. Ongoing 
      objectives of the Web site include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Motivating students through the use of art in diverse disciplines</li>
      <li>Fostering critical and creative thinking </li>
      <li>Engaging users with curriculum content, the museum and contemporary 
        artists</li>
      <li>Showcasing unique projects with local schools and artists on an international 
        platform</li>
      <li>Disseminating high-quality curriculum materials that strengthen art 
        and interdisciplinary teaching and learning in schools</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Rationale and Research</h2>
    <p>From an art education perspective, it is not enough to teach technique 
      alone. Engaging students in life's essential questions, and finding ways 
      to explore big ideas that interweave a development of content and form, 
      are the responsibility of educators (Gogan, 2006). TAWM created a curriculum 
      model based on artistic practice to help teachers meet these goals. Responsive 
      to the new Pennsylvania curriculum standards, the site helps teachers connect 
      and apply the site content to existing class curricula beyond the art room. 
      The connection between the artistic practice and inter-disciplinary nature 
      of Warhol's work, as well as that of other artists featured on the site, 
      offers context and experience with topics across the Humanities disciplines. 
      Andy Warhol is usually thought of as a painter, but his careers also included 
      photographer, writer, music promoter, filmmaker, collector and even fashion 
      model. This diversity offers rich examples of an artist who embraced interdisciplinary 
      thinking. His extensive art practices provide a template for interdisciplinary 
      education, exploring historical and cultural contexts, cultural awareness, 
      civic engagement, literacy, the creative process, critical thinking, and 
      skills and career development. </p>
    <p>Research supports using artistic practice as an interdisciplinary and
      cross-curricular  learning model. In the series <em>Art Education in Practice</em>,
      Sydney  R. Walker explores methodologies for teaching meaning in art making.
      He  outlines characteristics of artists' practices, citing the following
       as crucial: purposeful play, risk-taking, experimentation, postponement
       of final meaning, searching, and questioning (Walker, 2001). It is this
       sense of engaging students in what art &quot;does,&quot; focusing on &quot;the
        work&quot; rather than &quot;a work&quot; of art that is core to effective
         art education (Dewey, 1934). Also, using artistic practice as a framework
         necessitates interaction between personal, socio-cultural, and physical
         contexts. This reflects the model of effective learning as described
        by  learning researchers John Falk and Lynn Dierking (2000).</p>
    <p>The interdisciplinary offerings of the site also support ongoing efforts 
      to develop new audiences for the museum. In a critical evaluation of art 
      museums, Eisner and Dobbs (1986) asserted, &quot;museum educators seem to 
      lack a well-defined vision of their responsibilities and the methodologies 
      necessary to develop new audiences for the Museum.&quot; A follow up study 
      indicated that the majority of museum professionals viewed the development 
      of new audiences as the responsibility of the education department (Williams, 
      1996). If new audience development is expected, then what training, tools, 
      and resources do education departments need to implement?</p>
    <p>These studies furthermore assert that lack of training in evaluation and 
      research methodologies makes it difficult for museums to assess the needs 
      of their audiences, both new and existing, as well as the effectiveness 
      of their programs. In the Warhol's site development, the use of design research 
      methodologies became a tool for conducting formative research on the needs, 
      abilities and effectiveness of on-line curriculum for the art teachers and 
      humanities teachers.</p>
    <p>Teachers were appreciably interested in other teachers' contributions 
      and feedback about educational resources. This supports research that indicates 
      teachers' visits to museums are strongly influenced by other teachers 
      (Mackety, 2004; Institute of Museum and Library Services, 1998). Throughout 
      the research process, we found teachers' contributions on the site 
      to be a rich source of new content and a method of grassroots promotion.</p>
    <h3>Content</h3>
    <p>The curriculum is designed for middle and high school students and aligned 
      with the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Arts and Humanities. Creative 
      learning assessments are integrated within instructional units and each 
      lesson and activity has been tested both in the museum and by working teachers 
      to ensure its relevancy and effectiveness. The site includes student work 
      examples and teacher adaptations of curriculum. Taking advantage of new 
      technology, the curriculum features student podcasts, audio and video clips, 
      printable versions and downloadable PowerPoint presentations. </p>
    <p>The site features the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The One-Day Art &amp; Activities section provides one-day activities 
        using a specific work of art as a springboard into a subject, series, 
        or method. </li>

    </p>
    <h2>Phase I</h2>
    <p>In an effort to create a beautiful aesthetic, the first iteration of the 
      site was given a clean and sparse design to feature the contemporary art 
      of Andy Warhol. The front page was intended to invite user navigation through 
      artworks that represented themes for exploration. This premise had been 
      used successfully in another on-line project, <a href="../http://www.warhol.org/tc21/" target="_blank">http://www.warhol.org/tc21/</a> 
      that had won several awards. However, in this iteration, users did not understand 
      what the site offered or for whom it was intended.</p>
    <p class="caption" ><img src="diSalvo.fig4.jpg" alt="Fig 4: The first iteration home page was live in the Russian language version before the English version." width="400" height="247" /></p>

    <p class="caption" >Fig 5: The first iteration home page in the English version 
      had some design modifications.</p>
    <p>In October 2005, UPCLOSE reviewed the first iteration of the site. For 
      this preliminary formative evaluation, five practicing teachers were recruited 
      from a non-profit organization promoting art education in the region. These 
      participants had an average of 12 years of teaching in middle and high schools. 
      The survey group consisted of four Visual Art teachers and one English teacher, 
      and all taught in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Data was collected using a 
      semi-structured telephone interview method. Each participant was contacted 
      individually via telephone, and the interviews were audio taped. Researchers 
      took notes on participants' exploration of the Web site and responses to 
      questions posed. </p>
    <p>The surveys began with a set of general questions about the participants&quot; 
      professional and computer experience. Then, using a think-aloud protocol, 
      participants were directed to explore the Web site for a short time with 
      occasional prompts from the researcher if needed. This survey focused on 
      a completed section, &quot;One-Day Art &amp; Activities&quot; .</p>
    <p>The Warhol initially assumed users could be drawn into the content through 
      artworks and visuals with minimal guides. However, the first on-line versions 
      did not provide adequate navigation to reach the rich content. The clean 
      white space and small text in low-contrast color made it very difficult 
      for users to read. The pages were not legible as a projection in a classroom 
      environment, nor for multiple users at one monitor. The visual design proved 
      unpopular because it was not considered representative of Andy Warhol and 
      might not catch the attention of the students. Usability issues were found 
      with the navigation: users feeling lost, unsure of where they were or where 
      they could go. In addition, some teachers could not access the site because 
      it required a plug-in Flash application not available at their school's 
      workstations.</p>
    <p>Despite these difficulties, teachers were impressed and enthusiastic about 
      the rich content resources and curricula available on the site. The content 
      was developed over a decade through prototypes and workshops, where both 
      art and humanities teachers worked closely with museum educators. Teacher 
      input and feedback dramatically shaped these lessons, making them viable 
      for classroom use as well as attractive in their clear explanations of complex 
      ideas. TAWM's practice of curricula development incorporates design research 
      methods and is a critical part of creating value in the site. Each museum 
      has its own useful methods of developing programming, but incorporating 
      the Warhol's example of working extensively with the intended audience, 
      in this case teachers from various disciplines, will serve museums well 
      in developing on-line content that can help museums break out of their traditional 
      audience. </p>
    <p>The initial user evaluations provided a general understanding of the technology 
      resources and abilities of teachers in the region. The evaluations examined 
      what visual and textual indicators were needed for teachers to determine 
      in the first moments of visiting if the site would be of value to them, 
      and can be conducted with sample home pages that fit different concepts 
      for site direction.</p>
    <p>While teachers understood that the site was &quot;Arty,&quot; it was difficult 
      for them to navigate, and they did not think that their students would find 
      it appealing. After reviewing this feedback, the Warhol and the design firm 
      tried to negotiate a best solution, followed by a decision to part ways. 
      This was a challenging result for the museum due to the tight deadline of 
      the Web project expected to concur with traveling exhibition dates. TAWM's 
      previous use of designers for on-line activities served general audiences 
      and not educators specifically. Because of this, the design firm did not 
      anticipate a higher priority on usability over aesthetics. In future development, 
      the museums and designers should explore user research with all of the team 
      members having direct contact with end users. </p>
    <h2>Phase II</h2>
    <p>The Warhol was responsive to the user feedback and redesigned the site 
      with bold bright visuals in grid patterns. This second iteration was successful 
      for setting the context of an educational site featuring Warhol's work and 
      Pop art in general. In usability testing, however, there were still teachers 
      who did not understand all of the intended goals of the site as outlined 
      by TAWM.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="diSalvo.fig6.jpg" alt="Fig 6: The Warhol: Resources and Lessons home page during the second phase of user testing. The cross-disciplinary nature of the content was still not readily clear." width="400" height="297" /></p>
    <p class="caption" >Fig 6: The Warhol: Resources and Lessons home page during 
      the second phase of user testing. The cross-disciplinary nature of the content 
      was still not readily clear. </p>
    <p>Phase II consisted of interviews with fifteen teachers recruited from a 
      non-profit organization promoting art education in the region. These K-12 
      teachers had an average of 16.5 years experience. The survey group consisted 
      of nine Studio Art and Art History teachers; five Music teachers; one Theatre 
      Arts teacher, and one English teacher, twelve participants were from Southwestern 
      Pennsylvania, and two were from other states. Data was collected using a 
      semi-structured individual telephone interview method and audio taped while 
      the researchers took notes on participants' exploration and responses. Participants 
      were randomly placed into three groups. Each group focused on a specific 
      section of the Web site. The surveys began with a set of general questions 
      about the participants&quot; professional and computer experience. Then, 
      using a think-aloud protocol, participants were directed to explore the 
      Web site for a short time with occasional prompts from the researcher if 
      needed. </p>
    <p>All participants enjoyed the look and feel of the Web site and felt the 
      visual style was appropriate for an art education resource. Several commented 
      that the visual style reflected their expectations for a Web site about 
      Warhol or TAWM. Participants understood the context to be a site for educators, 
      primarily applicable for art and design related coursework. Still, the site's 
      stated intent to support <em>teaching across humanities</em> was less clearly 
      understood. Some participants did not initially realize that the content 
      would extend beyond Warhol's work or the museum itself. This confusion limited 
      the anticipated usefulness of the site, especially for those teaching outside 
      the visual arts. It was imperative in the next iteration to be mindful of 
      the initial goal to disseminate high-quality curriculum materials that strengthen 
      art and interdisciplinary teaching during development. While higher-level 
      goals such as this may be refined based on user input, without a guiding 
      framework, positive responses to a site can sidetrack the project team into 
      missing opportunities in future iterations.</p>
    <p>At times the intended audience was unclear; for example, one teacher initially 
      thought the site would be for introductory coursework but realized during 
      her exploration that it was intended for advanced students. Additionally, 
      confusion surrounded the relationship between other artists featured on 
      the site and Andy Warhol. It was not until participants delved deeper into 
      the content that the intent of the site and opportunities for interdisciplinary 
      projects became clear. The content was not the obstacle in attracting the 
      correct audience: the problem again lay in the context or housing of these 
      rich resources.</p>
    <p>Most user-study participants felt the site would be valuable for gathering
       curriculum ideas and incorporating new activities into existing lesson
      plans.  However, the navigation confused some teachers. They were frustrated
      by  not immediately finding overviews of each section and concise descriptions
       of the lesson plans. The findings show that busy teachers with limited
       computer time need to be able to quickly identify the utility of the site
       resources. Seemingly small issues, such the availability of PowerPoint
      presentations,  large enough text for projection, and pages formatted for
      print, were the  items that teachers indicated would bring them back to
      the site repeatedly.  Teachers said they might print from their browser
      or by cutting and pasting  because they did not notice the PDF printable
      content in the menu. And while  teachers had access to projectors, their
      skill in processing images for  projection varied. The lack of PowerPoint-ready
      images or PDFs might deter  their inclusion of the information in a class,
      as would downloading large  size files. The ability to find and use tools
      for the classroom will encourage  teachers to use the site regularly instead
      of as a one-time inspiration. 
    </p>
    <p>User testing highlighted another area for internal review: the use of
      content  dealing with violence and death. Two teachers expressed concern
      regarding  the elementary age-appropriateness of these specific art works
      and activities.  TAWM values art in its ability to be a catalyst for discussion,
      in this  case about media literacy and the second amendment. The museum
      chose to  re-title these lessons instead of censoring them. When considering
      the inclusion  of provocative content, museums must weigh the audiences'
      possible negative perceptions with their institutional goals. A secondary
      home page could be created when educators have concerns over the appropriateness
      of  content in the larger site, thus limiting the opportunity for younger
      students  to encounter some of the more provocative images that the Warhol
      site and  other museums have. In this way, younger audiences will have
      access to some  content without limiting content for others.</p>
    <p>As indicated in research, teachers are influenced by their peers' 
      endorsement of museum resources (Mackaty, 2003; IMLS 1998). Information
      showing other teachers' use of the site and sample student work was considered
      extremely valuable by some teachers in this phase. They felt more teacher
      reviews and examples would validate the site and keep the content fresh,
      thus encouraging teachers to revisit the site regularly. </p>
    <h2 style="page-break-after:auto;">Phase III</h2>
    <p>In the third iteration of the site, simple visual and textual clues were 
      included on the home page to provide better context. The organization of 
      the lesson plans was standardized for navigational ease and a list of links 
      to lesson plans based on discipline areas was added. Even if teachers did 
      not explore these areas immediately, they understood that lessons for disciplines 
      besides visual arts were available, therefore helping set the context for 
      cross-disciplinary teaching.</p>
    <p class="caption"><strong><em><img src="diSalvo.fig7.jpg" alt="Fig 7: User feedback shaped the signpost and language that set the context for the third iteration of the site." width="400" height="301" /> 
      </em></strong></p>
    <p align="center" class="caption" >Fig 7: User feedback shaped the signpost and 
      language that set the context for the third iteration of the site. </p>
    <p>The testing in Phase III shifted to an on-line survey methodology. E-mail 
      recruitment yielded 112 invited respondents over two months during the summer 
      of 2006. Content was continually added, and minor modifications were made 
      to the usability of the site during the run of the on-line survey. Teachers 
      were recruited using existing Warhol Educator databases, professional list 
      serves, message boards, and a request on the main Web site of TAWM. Participants 
      were asked to explore <em>The Warhol: Resources &amp; Lessons</em> Web site 
      for 15 minutes and then answer questions using an on-line survey. The survey 
      consisted of three sections, User Information, Content Usefulness, and Usability 
      Assessment.</p>
    <p>The participants represent a range of experience teaching between 1-15+ 
      years. </p>
    <p class="caption" ><strong><em><img src="diSalvo.fig8.jpg" alt="Fig 8: Most participants (86%) were teachers in schools and 14% were museum educations or other types of educators including administrators." width="400" height="308" /></em></strong></p>
    <p align="center" class="caption" >Fig 8: Most participants (86%) were teachers

    <p class="caption" >Fig 9: Subject areas and disciplines</p>
    <p>Visual Arts teachers were the largest group of participants and most other 
      participants were Humanities teachers. The largest audience was teachers 
      in the Pittsburgh region, represented in the number of respondents from 
      Pennsylvania (41%); however educators from over 27 states and 4 countries 
      (France, Switzerland, England and the Ukraine) also participated. Participants 
      represented urban areas (48%), suburban areas (40%), and rural areas (12%).</p>
    <h3>General Findings </h3>
    <p>The findings show that teachers are using museums' on-line resources 
      for full lesson plans, for lesson ideas, for general research and for image 
      resources far more frequently than we anticipated. We provided a list of 
      museums with good curriculum and respondents indicated that they had used 
      the museums listed with frequency:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>National Gallery of Art (52.1%) </li>
      <li>The Smithsonian Institution (52.1%)</li>
      <li>Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met) (46.6%) </li>
      <li>Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) (43.8%)</li>
      <li>Getty Museum (31.5%)</li>
      <li>The Art Institute of Chicago (28.8%)</li>
      <li>San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) (15.1%) </li>
      <li>Walker Art Center (6.8%)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To further understand teachers' interest in on-line lessons from TAWM, 
      we asked participants, &quot;How often do you visit TAWM with your class?&quot; 
      Of the survey respondents, 17% responded that they visit once a year or 
      more, 58% responded &quot;never&quot;, and 25% responded &quot;N/A.&quot; 
      And when we asked, &quot;How often do you use the on-line resources available 
      at the Warhol's Web site?&quot; 47% of educators responded that they use 
      the Warhol on-line resources once a year or more. This indicates that because 
      of the large number of respondents from Pennsylvania, the museum is a significant 
      resource for teachers in the region.</p>
    <p>To understand more general use of the Internet and on-line resources, we 
      asked, &quot;How often do you use the Internet to research and develop curriculum 
      for your class?&quot;; 61% responded &quot;weekly&quot; and 23% responded 
      &quot;monthly.&quot; When asked, &quot;How often do you present visual media 
      in your classroom?,&quot; 69% responded &quot;weekly&quot; and 14% responded 
      &quot;monthly.&quot; These figures indicate the Warhol has promising opportunities 
      to gain new audiences and provide quality resources on artistic practices 
      on-line. </p>
    <p>When asked, &quot;How would you describe the value of this site to another 
      teacher?&quot;, 95% of the responses were very positive. Positive responses 
      included general appeal and usability such as the following comment:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Outstanding! The Museum has done an amazing job 
      of connecting art to the standards and interdisciplinary subjects. Students 
      from K-12 to higher education can learn so much!</p>
    <p>Many found the depth of the content available to be of value:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I didn't know about the depth of the education 
      portion of the site until now. It's a great site for making connections 
      with contemporary and modern art in the classroom.</p>
    <p>And many saw opportunities for interdisciplinary applications, including 
      some very specific prospects:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I would highly recommend it. I teach Sociology 
      and Psychology. Within the first minute I found 4-6 lessons that I could 
      incorporate into my curriculum. This is very valuable because I want to 
      make those classes more visual. It is very difficult to find lessons that 
      are that practical for my class. One I plan to use as soon as school starts 
      back in Sociology is the lesson on Hammer 
      and Sickle: Interpreting meaning in symbols. For Psychology - History 
      and memory - Collective memory. Each lesson has enough info to work 
      on tailoring it to your needs without being overwhelming.</p>
    <p>When asked about their anticipated use of the Warhol site, the responses 
      were positive with over 80% responding that they strongly agreed or agreed 
      they would be able to use the content and images from the site in their 
      classroom. For planning activities in the classroom, 86% strongly agreed 
      or agreed that the site would be useful, and 78% strongly agreed or agreed 
      the site would help them when developing curriculum to meet required standards. 
      Almost all (95%) indicated that they would recommend the site to a colleague, 
      and 82% of the respondents indicated that they would bookmark the site. 
    </p>
    <h2>Interdisciplinary Opportunities</h2>
    <p>The large number of educators working in collaboration was surprising. 
      To assess current collaboration, the survey asked, &quot;How often do you 
      collaborate with other teachers?&quot;; 65% of the respondents indicated 
      that they collaborate monthly (26%) or weekly (39%). The use of collaborative 
      methods promoted by the site offers visual arts teachers a chance to continue 
      to expose students to the visual arts (while federal funding is being cut 
      to visual arts) and for Humanities teachers to use artistic practice and 
      experiences as a way to create more meaningful lessons. TAWM had concerns 
      that the focus on specific artists would not be applicable to K-12 teachers 
      because they taught art practices and did not readily use the work of current 
      and historic figures in their teaching. But when asked, &quot;How often 
      do you focus on a specific artist and his/her practice in your classroom?&quot;, 
      over half (56%) of the educators responded that they do monthly or weekly. 
    </p>
    <p>With few sites focusing on teaching across the humanities, museums have 
      an opportunity to increase their impact inside on schools by offering curriculum 
      and resources for teachers on-line. Moreover, museums, particularly art 
      museums, have an opportunity to move beyond their practice area by offering 
      teachers in other disciplines new tools and perspectives on teaching across 
      the Humanities. For example, TAWM is seen by many as a resource for art 
      education, but the work of the museum has far broader application and with 
      the right tools can provide dynamic ways of using the arts to advance other 
      core curriculum goals. Museums can use this opportunity to meet the needs 
      of schools striving to present cross-curricular lessons as a strategy to 
      deal with crowded curricula. </p>
    <p>When we asked a series of questions about <em>The Warhol: Resources &amp; 
      Lessons</em> Web site and its success for teaching across the humanities, 
      most teachers agreed that is was a valuable resource for interdisciplinary 
      work.</p>
    <p class="caption" ><img src="diSalvo.fig10.jpg" alt="Fig 10: Teaching Across the Humanities Stats" width="400" height="283" /></p>
    <p class="caption" >Fig 10: Teaching Across the Humanities Stats</p>
    <h2>Answering Usability Issues</h2>
    <p>Teachers found the current iteration of the site to have good usability 
      and navigation. While the site's navigation is much improved from previous 
      evaluations of the site, suggested future improvements include a more systematic 
      approach to navigation and a standardized frame for the lessons. </p>
    <p>The final segment of the survey asked general usability questions. The 
      responses were positive, with 80% or more educators responding that they 
      strongly agree or agree to all of following statements about usability:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It was easy to use the site.</li>
      <li>The information was clearly presented.</li>
      <li>The navigation was easy to use.</li>
      <li>I liked the overall look and feel of the site.</li>
      <li>I could find what I was looking for.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order to learn more specifically about the usability of the site, the 
      survey asked, &quot;How could we improve this site for you?&quot; Of the 
      45 responses, most were extremely positive with no direct suggestions<em>: 
      &quot;I will let you know after I implement a few of the lessons next year! 
      Thanks tons for developing this site!&quot; </em></p>
    <p>The most common suggestions were for additional content to assist with 
      cross-disciplinary curriculum to meet their particular interest area, more 
      video, sound clips and interactive experiences, and more content specific 
      to elementary students. Teachers also asked for space to include their comments 
      and ways to update the site, and suggested continual addition of content 
      so that it remains new and interesting: <em>&quot;Provide opportunities 
      for user-generated content that shows how teachers use the site to generate 
      new lessons and student work.&quot; </em></p>
    <p>To gain specific feedback on what was positive and negative about the site, 
      we asked teachers two open-ended questions. Sixty-three teachers provided 
      specific feedback when asked, &quot;What are the most positive aspects of 
      the site?&quot; Many wrote about the general usefulness or specific content:&nbsp; 
      <em>&quot;The PowerPoint presentations, the unique lesson ideas. The fact 
      that other artists can be explored in addition to Warhol.&quot;</em></p>
    <p>The quality of content elicited the most responses: &quot;<em>There is 
      still a depth of content while still being attractive and nice to use. There's 
      honestly more content than I would ever likely read all through, but that's 
      a good thing. It means I will keep coming back.&quot;</em> 
      </p>
    <p>Finally, a major theme in the comments was the interdisciplinary nature 
      of the resources: </p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">There are images, related stories and links, student 
      examples, information about the work of a museum, collecting, etc. that 
      a lot of people and students don't know about but may be interested in - 
      puts things in a different perspective. The biggest thing - you don't have 
      to teach art to use the site in class or feel like a loser because you don't 
      (teach art).</p>
    <p>When asked, &quot;What are the most negative aspects of the site?&quot;, 
      39 offered specific feedback but little consistency in that feedback. Seven 
      had issues with the usability or navigation, and five had problems with 
      computer compatibility or low bandwidth. Most responses requested additional 
      content, and three comments suggested the amount of content could be overwhelming.</p>
    <p>In future development, a systematic approach to building the site architecture 
      will assist in developing new content and limit the number of errors. Errors 
      on a site not only cause teachers to look for more technologically reliable 
      resources, but also suggest that the intellectual content is not reliable. 
      Links to report technical errors would be helpful in any new development, 
      as would employing a teacher (or intended end user) with limited computer 
      experience to conduct a systematic usability test of the site.</p>
    <h2 style="page-break-after:auto;">Discussion</h2>
    <p>The Warhol's experience in developing <em>Warhol: Resources and Lessons</em> 
      can show us some general themes for future development of such on-line cross-disciplinary 
      curricula. Many of these themes focus on working with teachers as audience, 
      authors and ambassadors. The inclusion of teachers' feedback in the 
      curriculum content, the on-line navigation, and the design and communication 
      of the cross-disciplinary intent created a successful marriage of content 
      and form.</p>
    <p>The value of formative research in developing the content and the on-line 
      delivery is immeasurable. Ongoing rigorous development through school workshops, 
      outreach programs and collaborations with teachers is an important reason 
      the content is regarded as &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;thoughtful&quot;. 
      Museum education departments have many different and effective methods of 
      developing curriculum, and the inclusion of a collaborative process with 
      teachers will not only improve the quality of the content; it will also 
      increase teachers' ownership, and endorsement will bring peer recognition.</p>
    <p>TAWM's first and less successful iteration, an on-line gallery, also points 
      to the need to include the target audience in the contextual stages even 
      after much of the text has been created. Museum educators may not be able 
      to engage outside evaluation in every case of delivering curriculum on-line, 
      but they can conduct some basic user research. There are options that can 
      give insights on users with out extensive training; such as &quot;low-fi&quot; 
      prototyping (Retting, 1994) and observations of teachers (Hackos &amp; Redish, 
      1998). Team members can also adapt personas of &quot;typical users&quot; 
      and act out experiences using the site to meet projected goals. These basic 
      heuristic evaluations provide quick and inexpensive methods to uncover usability 
      issues before final production (Nielson, 1994). During site development, 
      Cognitive Walkthroughs (leading users through an experience) allow for a 
      general assessment of general functionality and can help the museum understand 
      teachers' goals in using on-line resources (Lewis and Wharton, 1997). 
    </p>
    <p>An outside expert is able to provide fresh perspectives, but considering 
      museum budgets and timelines, an informed outsider viewpoint can also be 
      gleaned from a docent group or student teacher intern. The site designers 
      should be invited and encouraged to talk with teachers, observe, and participate 
      in iterative testing to gain teacher buy-in so that the evaluative process 
      is legitimate and provides more objective insights. </p>
    <p>The context of the site, in the first iteration, was a roadblock to teachers
       trying to reach the rich content. In the second iteration of the site,
      the  museum took some basic feedback from the Phase I evaluation and developed
       a site that had most of the components necessary to deliver their valuable
       content. The third iteration of the site was refined to meet their higher
       goals. This iterative process with continual reflection on the initial
      objectives  was imperative to create the proper context or housing for
      the site so that  the rich interdisciplinary content would be valued and
      used, and the higher-level  goals could be met. </p>
    <p>Raising awareness in the target audience about the availability of lessons 
      and resources on the Warhol site will be an ongoing challenge. While the 
      response to the site was overwhelmingly positive, the need to market this 
      valuable resource is strong. Many of the teachers indicated that they will 
      be recommending the site to others, and this sort of grass-roots marketing 
      will be essential in building a user base for the site. Within their interviews 
      there were some specific comments about how to raise awareness of the site 
      and what functionalities they would need in the site to encourage peers 
      to visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </p>
    <p>Some of the recommendations were simple marketing tools, such as providing 
      an icon link for their school's Web site or e-mail links to suggest the 
      site to others. Other recommendations were more viral in nature; as teachers 
      developed the curricula with the Warhol, their personal investment grew, 
      and they contributed their comments and school projects to the site. By 
      utilizing the teachers' enthusiasm to become authors of the site, the 
      museum can raise awareness from the teacher/authors' self-promotion 
      with their peers. By sending links to their own projects and content, teachers 
      imply endorsement of the whole site and the idea of cross-disciplinary links 
      to the museum. This collegial network, this sharing of resources, is a strong 
      influence on teachers' use of museums and content sources. 
      </p>
    <p>In the final evaluation, teachers indicated they enjoyed and respected 
      how the content was organized and communicated. They wanted more topics 
      and tools&nbsp; provided in the same way. Some wanted underrepresented groups 
      to be more heavily featured; others wanted new media and tools, or more 
      content for additional disciplines. Offering opportunities for teachers 
      to provide ongoing feedback will not only raise awareness but also could 
      help the museum prioritize the development of new content. This should be 
      balanced with content, directed at new audiences, developed around curriculum 
      standards that have yet to be addressed.</p>
