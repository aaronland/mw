				  <h1>Introduction</h1>
				  <p>At the Exploratorium &ndash; a museum of science,
				    art, and human perception in San Francisco&nbsp; &ndash; a team of media
				    creators and educators has been experimenting with developing
				    content and public events in <strong>Second Life</strong>,
				    a massively multi-user, three-dimensional virtual world and
				    rapidly growing on-line community. We&rsquo;ve created a virtual museum
				    in Second Life called the <strong>'Splo</strong> (secondlife://Midnight
				    City/176/58/26), and filled it with over 100 exhibits
				    and exhibitions. Some of these are new to the Web, and many
				    would be difficult to make in a real-world museum. But by
				    creating and testing these exhibits with virtual-world visitors,
				    and by experimenting with a series of informal science-education events,
				    we&rsquo;ve learned
				    some important lessons we&rsquo;d like to share with other museum professionals
				    about creating content and community in Second Life. </p>
				  <p>In this paper, we&rsquo;ll give examples of the
				    exhibits we&rsquo;ve built in the 'Splo and describe the in-world
				    experience of presenting live events. We&rsquo;ll also discuss an important
				    underlying theme that affects every museum exhibit and exhibition in
				    Second Life: the inherent social interaction of participants. Sharing
				    experiences with other people makes visits more memorable and more fun.
				    Not only can avatars (representations of virtual world participants)
				    visit museums in Second Life with friends who may come from half-way
				    around the world, but also the physical and social dynamics of telepresence,
				    and the ability to control the world and objects in it, provide unique
				    learning situations for them. </p>
				  <p>What can a museum
				      do in a virtual world that would be difficult to do in the real world?</p>
				  <p>You can do things with a visitor that would be impossible
				    to do in real life. </p>
				  <p>In the real-world Exploratorium, there&rsquo;s an
				    exhibit called <em>Vanna.</em> At that
				    exhibit, visitors walk up to an upside-down photo, mounted on a wall,
				    of television personality Vanna White. At first, there doesn&rsquo;t
				    seem to be anything wrong with the image &ndash; except that it&rsquo;s
				    upside-down. When the visitor rotates the photo so it&rsquo;s right-side-up,
				    though, they&rsquo;re startled by the grotesque sight of a very unfamiliar
				    (and unattractive) Vanna. The image has been manipulated: Vanna&rsquo;s
				    eyes and mouth have been cut out and placed upside-down in the otherwise
				    right-side-up face, something nobody notices when the image is upside-down.
				    The exhibit shows how people analyze images in pieces, looking at the
				    eyes and mouth independently of the face. </p>
				  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><a href="rothfarb.fig1.html"><img src="rothfarb.fig1a.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="160" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 1: When the viewer is rotated, the distorted
				    image of avatar Patio Plasma becomes obvious.</p>
				  <p>In our virtual museum in Second Life, we&rsquo;ve
				    made two copies of this exhibit and done some experimenting. In one copy,
				    the viewer rotates the photograph, as in the real-world museum. In the
				    other copy, we move the visitor instead! The visitor sits in a chair
				    to view an upside-down image of Patio Plasma, the Exploratorium&rsquo;s
				    avatar scientist. The chair then rotates the visitor while the upside-down
				    photo remains stationary on the wall. As visitors turn, they see the
				    image of Patio right-side-up from their own point of view. Just like
				    Vanna, Patio&rsquo;s eyes have been turned upside-down, creating a rather
				    unnerving right-side-up portrait.</p>
				  <p>When we see people interact with these exhibits
				    in the 'Splo, we wait a bit and then introduce ourselves and ask
				    them about their experiences. Every visitor reports having had a more
				    memorable experience when they were rotated rather than when the photograph
				    was rotated. </p>
				  <p>In a virtual museum, we highly recommend making
				    the visiting avatar a part of the exhibit at every opportunity.&nbsp; </p>
				  <h2>You Can Change A Visitor&rsquo;s Visual And Positional Frames Of Reference.</h2>
				  <p>Consider walking into a real-world room that has
				    a chair attached to the ceiling and a chandelier rising straight up from
				    the center of the floor. A visitor to this odd room might have some problems
				    figuring out how to sit in that upside-down, ceiling-mounted chair. But
				    in the 'Splo, it&rsquo;s no problem. Fly up and sit in the chair
				    and your avatar flips upside-down. The view flips upside-down as well.
				    Suddenly, the room is right-side-up with the chandelier hanging from
				    the ceiling. But what are the consequences of having these kinds of &lsquo;abilities&rsquo;?</p>
				  <p><span class="BodyTextChar">In the 'Splo, we
				      have a trampoline mounted on a wall in an exhibit called <em>90 Degrees
				      From Normal.</em></span><span class="BodyTextChar"> At this virtual
				      exhibit, visitors can jump on the trampoline and do tricks. While they&rsquo;re
				      jumping, their view of the rest of the museum is sideways. Interestingly,
				      many visitors have reported a sense of real-world disorientation after
				      making these sideways jumps. Some even report dizziness and stomach
				      discomfort. This effect, known as simulation sickness (</span><span><a href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulator_sickness" target="_blank"><u>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulator_sickness</u></a></span>),
				      has been studied in the motion simulator field and is not well understood.
				      Since you don&rsquo;t know how each participant will react, it&rsquo;s
				      an important design consideration for virtual worlds where a participant
				      will move rapidly or have their orientation rapidly changed. It&rsquo;s
				      amazing that viewing an illusion through the eyes of an avatar in a
				      virtual world can change how we feel in the real world.</p>
				  <p>Changing frames of reference is important to physicists
				    when they analyze the universe. In future Second Life experiments, we
				    plan to use this ability to allow people to &lsquo;experience&rsquo; relativistic
				    effects.</p>
				  <h2>You Can Change The Scales Of Objects.</h2>
				  <p>Unlike experimentation in the real world, it&rsquo;s
				    easy to change the scale of natural phenomena in the virtual world. Consider
				    an exhibit we built in the 'Splo that was designed to help visitors
				    understand eclipses. It was simply a scale model of the earth/moon system.
				    We made a 1-meter-diameter model of the earth and hung it in space. (It&rsquo;s
				    so much easier to hang a model in a virtual world!) At this scale, we
				    hung the moon model &ndash; a sphere &frac14;-meter in diameter &ndash; 30
				    meters (nearly 100 feet!) away from the earth model. </p>
				  <p>This turns out to be a powerful model when an avatar
				    takes the long walk from the earth to the moon. Visitors to the exhibit &ndash; including
				    real-world astronomers &ndash; have noted that they&rsquo;d had no true
				    appreciation for the scale of the earth to the moon before encountering
				    this experience. The resulting level of understanding is better than
				    what can be obtained from any real-world textbook, photograph, or 2D
				    illustration on a Web page. </p>
				  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><a href="rothfarb.fig2.html"><img src="rothfarb.fig2a.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="400" height="283" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 2: An avatar interacts with a scale model of
				    an earth/moon system &ndash; a companion exhibit developed for the Exploratorium&rsquo;s
				    total solar eclipse Webcast.</p>
				  <p>In the virtual world, well-made objects and scenery
				    with good levels of geometric detail and high-resolution texture maps
				    (images wrapped on 3D objects) provide important information to the participant
				    and add to the virtual experience. Collaborator Aimee Weber created a
				    realistic model of the sun by using two different texture layers, both
				    with rendered solar surface patterns. The outer layer, mostly transparent,
				    is animated and rotates over an inner opaque layer. But even a virtual
				    world cannot accommodate the sun at this scale. It would be a sphere
				    100 meters in diameter placed 12,000 meters away. This is an impossible
				    scale to achieve in most 3D simulations, including virtual worlds like
				    Second Life. </p>
				  <p>Besides affording access to the really big, a virtual
				    world can also offer access to the very small: change scale
				    in the other direction and avatars can visit the atomic world. The Science
				    Library in Second Life, for example (Science Center: secondlife://Info
				    Island II/97/206/24), contains a model of both
				    a carbon nanotube and a molecule of buckminsterfullerene
				    that an avatar can fly into. These models give a great sense
				    of the placement of carbon atoms in three-dimensional space.</p>
				  <p>An avatar inspired by his visit to the 'Splo
				    built a model of the <strong>Brownian motion phenomenon,</strong> which
				    describes the random motion of particles. Four cubes that in the real
				    world would be just a few nanometers across tumble and spin inside a
				    transparent cube 10 meters on a side. With a touch of a button, small
				    red atoms appear, striking the cubes and giving them their random motion.
				    This illustrates, in three dimensions, the behavior of small particles
				    undergoing the Brownian motion effect, first mathematically formulated
				    by Einstein in his miraculous year of 1905. When we saw this exhibit,
				    we immediately suggested that avatars be allowed to ride the cubes, taking
				    advantage of what we&rsquo;ve previously learned about the virtual-visitor
				    scale-of-reference experience. The view from a particle undergoing Brownian
				    motion and rotation in three dimensions is an amazing wild ride!</p>

				  <p class="caption">Fig 3: Atoms (shown red) collide with cubes, causing

				  <h2>You Can Create Hyper-Linked Information On Exhibits And Easily Give
				    Copies To Visitors</h2>
				  <p>Museums in the real world often struggle with issues
				    of presenting interpretive text and images that accompany exhibits. If
				    you offer all the information one interested visitor could want, then
				    you might drive another visitor away. We&rsquo;ve found that in a virtual
				    museum, different techniques for presenting exhibit graphics can offer
				    solutions to this problem. For example, you can create rich textures
				    adjacent to or on exhibit objects that contain visual or textual information,
				    or you can attach <strong>notecard</strong> objects.&nbsp; </p>
				  <p>Here&rsquo;s how it works: When a visitor scrolls
				    the mouse pointer over an exhibit, a roll-over event is triggered and
				    the name of the exhibit is displayed. Clicking the object (or a mapped
				    area on the object) triggers an event that offers the visitor a notecard.
				    Text on the notecard might offer basic instructions about what &ldquo;To
				    Do and Notice&rdquo; in the exhibit, or it can contain the name of the
				    exhibit and a link back to it and to the museum location. It can either
				    be read on-screen or saved to the visitor&rsquo;s inventory of personal
				    objects for review later. The visitor might also give a copy of the notecard
				    to another avatar. </p>
				  <p>Notecards can be linked to other notecards or to
				    Web pages, offering deeper levels of detail, further examples, and references
				    (for basic notecards, though, we suggest keeping things brief). Both
				    notecards and objects can also be scripted to offer the visitor an object
				    or script. For example, you could give someone something related to the
				    exhibit, a t-shirt or hat customized with museum or exhibit graphics,
				    a talking book, almost anything. This flexibility in presenting multiple
				    layers of exhibit information along with mementos or artifacts of exhibits
				    is a compelling element of virtual world design in Second Life. </p>
				  <h2>You Can Let Visitors Experience Dangerous Situations, Or Take Them
				    To Remote Locations.</h2>
				  <p>If you&rsquo;d like to explore the inside of a nuclear
				    reactor core in real life, you&rsquo;d better study up on radiation safety.
				    Avatars in Second Life, though, can have no fear flying around inside
				    a three-dimensional model of a working nuclear reactor to see how it
				    works and how it is controlled. We&rsquo;ve met one resident who is a
				    real-life nuclear scientist and is planning to build a reactor model
				    in Second Life.</p>
				  <p>For those of us with childhood dreams of growing
				    up to be an astronaut, the International Spaceflight Museum (<span><a href="../http://slispaceflightmuseum.org/" target="_blank"><u>http://slispaceflightmuseum.org</u></a></span>)
				    has created a planetarium experience in Second Life (Spaceport Alpha)
				    in which visitors actually fly into space to observe scale models of
				    the planets and their moons. For example, a visitor can walk on the surface
				    of Mars to observe the Viking Spacecraft and see a panoramic view constructed
				    of real images of the Martian surface.</p>
				  <p>On March 29, 2006, the Exploratorium created a science
				    education program as part of our live Webcast coverage of a total solar
				    eclipse from Side, Turkey (<em>Total Solar Eclipse: Live from Turkey, </em><span><a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/2006/index.html" target="_blank"><u>http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/2006/index.html</u></a></span>).
				    Created in collaboration with NASA&rsquo;s Sun-Earth Connection Education
				    Forum, telescopic views of the rare sun-moon-earth alignment were broadcast
				    with scientific commentary via satellite, television, and Internet streaming
				    to hundreds of thousands of viewers worldwide. In addition to these presentations,
				    we also offered an all-night live program at our museum location in San
				    Francisco. We wanted to extend this public programming into Second Life
				    by sharing the live remote event with residents there (Rothfarb, R. J.,
				    Doherty, P., Higdon, R., and A. Weber, 2006). This practice of bringing
				    real-world elements such as Webcast video into a virtual world is called
				    augmented reality (<span><a href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality"><u>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality</u></a></span><em>)</em>.
				    It offers a unique way to extend aspects of a museum&rsquo;s physical
				    place and practice into a shared context across geographic boundaries.</p>

				      88:</h3>
				    <p><em>There&rsquo;s a lot of excitement building about
				      the Total Solar Eclipse live Webcast event about to happen&hellip;and
				      anxiety! </em></p>
				    <p><em>Collaborator avatar Aimee Weber has built a
				      replica of the real second-century Roman amphitheater in Side, Turkey,
				      where the Exploratorium&rsquo;s Live@ Exploratorium Webcasting crew
				      will broadcast the solar eclipse and host the event with commentary.
				      Exploratorium Web developer avatar Pepto Majestic is managing details
				      of video streaming into Second Life (SL). Our first event in SL is
				      proving to be challenging to pull off, including the timing of getting
				      access to the sims we&rsquo;ll be using, final details of venue and
				      exhibit builds, and configuration and testing of the streaming video
				      server and network. Wanting to make sure we don&rsquo;t turn anybody
				      away, despite the middle-of-the-night timing, we&rsquo;ve replicated
				      the amphitheater and viewing screen for the Webcast video in three
				      sims. </em></p>
				    <p><em>Volunteers from the Midnight City group are
				      here as well as Exploratorium staff, SL friends, some Lindens, and
				      other visitors. To ensure that VIPs could participate, we originally
				      planned to restrict access to the primary sim to a closed group, but
				      attempts to solicit RSVPs didn&rsquo;t result in a large-enough list
				      of participants to warrant doing that. It&rsquo;s easier to leave it
				      accessible, so we&rsquo;re going with open entry. </em></p>
				    <p><em>Managing three environments is interesting.
				      You have to think about how people will find the right place to locate
				      themselves to experience the event and view the program, and how they
				      can be made to feel welcomed by other avatars. Mental note for next
				      time: Create wayfinding signage &ndash; arrows and intra-sim teleports
				      are good. </em></p>
				    <p><em>We&rsquo;ve placed collaborators on the project
				      as hosts in each of the sims to be able to greet people, answer questions
				      about event timing, help with any streaming-video playback problems
				      people might have, and provide basic crowd control. We stay in touch
				      with each other via IM to report on any problems or live event issues.
				      Even across the different sims, we feel connected and are easily able
				      to communicate with each other about what&rsquo;s going on.</em></p>

				  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">During the event, Pepto and Aimee
				        teleport between the three sims to visit those gathered,
				    answer questions, make sure everything is working correctly, and check
				    for sim lag or instability. Everything goes well, though some people
				    report video problems with embedded streaming video. We aren&rsquo;t sure if it&rsquo;s
				        their Quicktime configuration (which the SL client uses
				    to render video), a firewall problem, or communication between some clients
			          and the streaming server. </p>
				  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">In one of the sims, a quick-thinking
				        Midnight City group member rezzes a cube with an external
				    link to one of the Exploratorium&rsquo;s main Webcast URLs and places it on the ground
				      in front of the screen. This URL, served via a content-delivery network,
				      bypasses the dedicated streaming server, sending the video feed into
				      SL. Those who have problems with in-world video can simply click on
				      the cube to launch an external media player&hellip;et voila! </p>
				  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">This solution allows everybody to view the Webcast
				      program and is a great demonstration of the benefit of allowing build/script
				      rights for a group when configuring a sim. Remember, viewers can be
				      active participants. Other than an incident with a griefer (a resident
				      deliberately causing problems and being disruptive) who is running
				      scripts that impair the movement and functioning of avatars, everyone
				      is well-behaved. The griefer is ejected and banned.</p>

				  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">The drama of the eclipse is captivating,
				        and the excitement of the scientists, educators, crew,
				    and the&nbsp; crowds
				      in Side, Turkey, is contagious to the 65 residents gathered across
				      the three sims to view the Web cast. A wave of oohs and aaahs echoes
				      in group chat with each &ldquo;contact&rdquo; point of the eclipse,
				      and the unique solar flare phenomena that are captured via the different
				      telescopic views creates a buzz of discussion and questions. Several
				      residents say they feel as if they&rsquo;re experiencing the eclipse
				      first-hand.&nbsp; Almost everybody stays for the entire one-hour program.</p>
				  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">In the real Roman amphitheater in
				        Turkey, Exploratorium scientist Paul Doherty thanks SL
				    residents who collaborated on the event in SL and also the audiences
				    watching there, helping to make a further connection between remote and
				    virtual participants. The augmented reality of seeing the live solar
				    event, the transmission of the live program from Side, Turkey (across
				    the world for most of the participants in SL), along with the in-world
			          interaction, makes the event a unique learning experience.&nbsp; </p>
				  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Note to self: This is a cool way to watch a

				  <p>In Second Life, visitors experience a two-dimensional
				    display of three-dimensional information. They may travel with a group
				    of co-explorers who can discuss what they are observing in real time,
				    and they can also make and change the virtual world. There are &lsquo;movies,&rsquo; called
				    machinima, which allow the visitor to see changes in time in the world,
				    but there can also be three-dimensional movies in the form of animated
				    objects, as 3D objects pop in and out of existence under the control
				    of a script.</p>
				  <h2>You Can Allow The User To Move Through A Fully Interactive 3D View</h2>
				  <p>To create effects that approach this capability
				    outside of virtual worlds, pre-rendered 3D views of a space or an object
				    can be shown on Web pages and navigated smoothly via applications developed
				    in client-side applications like Flash or Java. Viewpoint and views are
				    limited, though, to those scenes you create up-front. Transferring multi-positional
				    views over the Internet is limited, and not very practical. Furthermore,
				    these types of systems are closed, in the sense that they are not typically
				    extendable by the user.</p>
				  <p>Real-time rendered views that provide infinite variability
				    in viewpoint and navigation are more powerful and flexible and provide
				    important visual and perceptual cues through movement transitions. A
				    scene that is recreated entirely on the user&rsquo;s computer leaves
				    the client-server communication pipeline for transfer of object and texture
				    data, position information, and other critical network communications.
				    Avatars walk around (and even fly around) in three dimensions&hellip;with
				    each other. This allows avatars to move behind or above an object. The
				    changed point of view is very important in real life to help people understand
				    what they are seeing. For example, in the 3D virtual world of the 'Splo
				    (as in the real-world Exploratorium), we have an object known as an Impossible
				    Triangle. If you sit in a chair and look at this object from one point
				    of view, it looks like a triangle made in three dimensions from wooden
				    beams with square cross-sections. And yet, if you move a bit to the right
				    or left and take a closer look, you can see that it&rsquo;s impossible
				    for the beams to be joined together as they appear to be joined. Only
				    moving around the scene in 3D can show the true nature of this illusion.</p>

				  <p class="caption">Fig 6: An object&rsquo;s connected shape is seen
				    when the avatar sits in a chair at a specific distance and orientation
				    from the Impossible Triangle exhibit at the 'Splo.</p>
				  <h2>You Can Let Users Control Their Own Points Of View</h2>
				  <p>Second Life gives each virtual user a camera to use to zoom in for a
				    close-up view of an object, and to zoom out to get an overview
				    of a scene and see how an object fits into the big picture. </p>
				  <p>The users can look through the camera at eye level
				    or move the camera view away from their avatars' positions.
				    They can also rotate and tilt the view. These are powerful
				    tools that are analogous to moving and seeing in the real
				    world, and while they may be difficult to get used to, they
				    provide an individualized experience in the virtual space.
				    Allowing users to move their viewpoints and change their gaze means
				    they can take in a large volume of visual information and
				    stimuli, and be given detailed spaces to explore. Similar navigation
				    is found in many computer games, so controlling the interface will feel
				    familiar to many people.</p>
				  <h2>You Can Give Users Access To &ldquo;Virtual Reality Rooms&rdquo; And &ldquo;Holodecks&rdquo;</h2>
				  <p>Using Quicktime VR and similar technologies, it
				    is possible to view panoramic virtual-reality displays on the Web. Visitors
				    can see the view all around them, as if they were standing in middle
				    of the Grand Canyon, or in the experiment chamber at a research accelerator
				    at CERN. These experiences work well in Second Life and are easier and
				    more economical to create than on the Web. Users accustomed to point-of-view
				    navigation in Second Life may find navigation easier in a Second Life
				    VR room than in a Web browser-based panoramic VR movie. </p>
				  <p>In a Second Life holodeck, complete three-dimensional
				    spaces can be created inside a room at the touch of a button. User-controlled
				    scripts can generate and move objects. Imagine standing in Volta&rsquo;s
				    eighteenth-century electrochemistry laboratory, walking around and picking
				    up glassware, or in Leonardo Da Vinci&rsquo;s fifteenth-century workshop,
				    playing with a model of his ornithopter! In Second Life, you can simulate
				    otherwise impossible experiences.</p>
				  <h2>You Can Allow Users To Create Persistent, Dynamic Content</h2>
				  <p>There is a joy in creating things, even in virtual
				    worlds. In Second Life, users can easily make customized 3D objects that
				    become part of the world and are immediately usable by other participants.
				    For example, one of the real-world Exploratorium&rsquo;s signature events
				    takes place on March 14 of each year, starting at 1:59 p.m. That date
				    and time (3.14159) is not only Einstein&rsquo;s birthday (March 14),
				    but also the first six digits of the never-ending number pi (which describes
				    the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter). We take
				    advantage of the happy coincidence to celebrate &ldquo;Pi Day&rdquo; with
				    pie &ndash; from apple pie to pizza pie. </p>
				  <p>At the 'Splo, one of the exhibits we&rsquo;ve
				    created for Pi Day invites participants to use the object-creation tools
				    in Second Life to create a drinking glass 10 centimeters in diameter
				    with a height equal to its circumference. We ask them to do this purely
				    by looking at the glass, and as they adjust its height, to guess when
				    the glass&rsquo;s height equals its circumference. Whey they&rsquo;re
				    done, participants carry their glass to a display shelf and place it
				    alongside glasses made by other visitors. Also on the shelf is the glass
				    that shows the correct answer. Almost everyone makes a glass that is
				    far too short! (Note that by pressing a &ldquo;more&rdquo; button, the
				    tools in Second Life allow object-builders to precisely specify the height
				    of a glass in centimeters. In the spirit of the exhibit, however, we&rsquo;ve
				    asked them not to use these advanced tools.)</p>
				  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig7" id="Fig7"></a><a href="rothfarb.fig7.html"><img src="rothfarb.fig7a.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="260" height="241" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 7: User-created water glass for Pi Day at the 'Splo.</p>
				  <p>A creative benefit of this type of exhibit is that
				    visitors can choose how to decorate their glasses. Second Life allows
				    people to import photographs as textures into the world, and then to
				    map these textures on to objects. Museum visitors can thus become museum
				    exhibit creators. (Of course, some oversight is required if the museum
				    is to remain in a &ldquo;PG&rdquo; region of the world, since visitors
				    may create glasses with inappropriate images for the community.)</p>
				  <h2>You Can Offer The User The Opportunity To Collaborate With People From
				    Around The World</h2>
				  <p>Second Life is a social experience. Even though
				    participants are each probably sitting alone at their computers, they
				    experience the virtual world in the company of friends. As we observe
				    visitors to the 'Splo, we see that many come alone, but after checking
				    out the place, they return with friends to share what they&rsquo;ve found.
				    It&rsquo;s great to listen in as they say to each other, &ldquo;Hey,
				    look at this!&rdquo; &ldquo;Try this!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Watch me!&rdquo; The
				    amazing thing about Second Life is that these people can share their
				    experiences even if they are each at their computers on the opposite
				    sides of the earth. Virtual meetings, object/environment building jamming
				    sessions, exhibit design and feedback, games, treasure hunts, music,
				    and filmmaking are common activities that offer great possibilities for
				    collaboration among visitors and between visitors and museum staff. A
				    museum experience is richer when you can share it.</p>

				  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Real life (RL) Patio Plasma and Pepto
				        Majestic attend SLCC&rsquo;06, the second annual Second Life Community Convention.
				      This gathering of human avatars is the SL community&rsquo;s RL confab,
				      offering a chance to socialize with people whose avatars we&rsquo;ve
				      come to know. An education workshop at the event draws around fifty
				      people, many of whom present projects and lead discussions about their
				      work in SL and how it impacts their educational institutions. Patio
				      and Pepto present a poster and paper about how they&rsquo;ve created
				      SL science exhibits and informal learning events, including the eclipse
				      Webcast (Doherty, P., Rothfarb, R., and D. Barker, 2006). We meet new
				      friends and old and begin to establish working relationships with other
				      educators, museum partners, and talented residents who are interested
				      in supporting the Exploratorium&rsquo;s work in SL, and also in collaborating
				      with us on content design and builds.</p>
				  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Every Sunday morning at 11 a.m. SLT (Second
				      Life Time), Patio meets with several dozen other avatars at the International
				      Spaceflight Museum (ISM) to hear a presentation on the latest discoveries
				      in space exploration. The presenter is often Troy McLuhan, a resident
				      active in the ISM who understands well how to present information in
				      SL. He types short notes in chat, shows great slides and movies, and
				      then creates three-dimensional models on and above the stage. Often,
				      a NASA engineer is in the audience and can add firsthand stories to
				      the presentation. Sometimes, since Patio is a planetary physicist,
				      she can also answer questions. Other times, she might help by sending
				      answers so the presenter can offer the information to others there.</p>
				  <h3 class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Day 254: </h3>
				  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">In one memorable lecture on the Apollo
				        project lunar missions, Troy McLuhan lands a full-sized,
				    three-dimensional Lunar Excursion Module on the stage.&nbsp; While he is lecturing, the
				      audience is also asking questions in chat and adding comments. Audience
				      members also talk privately via IM, so as not to interrupt the presentation.
				      For many, these parallel discussions make the experience of attending
				      the presentation more exciting. Someone else answers Patio&rsquo;s
				      question so she doesn&rsquo;t have to interrupt the lecturer. For the
				      lunar mission lecture, the audience is full of people who
				      are passionate about the lunar landing. People from all
				      over the earth create avatars who sit together and share their passion
				      for learning. </p>
				  <h2>Why Should Museums Use Multi-User Virtual Worlds Like Second Life?</h2>
				  <p>Given that the practice of using 3D visualization,
				    animation, and in some cases single-user virtual worlds is accepted and
				    established for exhibit development and research by museums, why should
				    museums consider publishing and maintaining multi-user virtual spaces?
				    It&rsquo;s certainly &lsquo;safer&rsquo; not to. Multi-user means you
				    have to think about real-time interpersonal communication which, for
				    the Web, has mainly been the realm of chat, videoconferencing, and games.
				    Even if you don&rsquo;t create multi-user games or game-like content,
				    you might not have experience thinking about Internet content and exhibit
				    design in the context of how multiple visitors experience the same content <em>together</em>.
				    Many feel a need to create a more social Internet and widen the on-line
				    exhibit aesthetic to include more of this element. </p>
				  <p>For educational and museum communities, a social
				    Internet can allow you to stay in touch with community members and casual
				    audiences and design and present content that&rsquo;s relevant for and
				    interesting to them in a personal way. Multi-user 3D virtual worlds allow &lsquo;face
				    to face&rsquo; interaction between Internet users in spaces that are
				    representational, abstract, or completely imaginary. Visitors are not
				    just bringing usernames; they&rsquo;re residents who can express an identity
				    and demonstrate their interest in your museum&rsquo;s ideas, creations,
				    and challenges. That persistence of identity and level of expressiveness
				    through character design, chat, and gesture allows both museum staff
				    and participants to make important social connections that, for many,
				    are not as easily made or maintained on the 2D Web.</p>
				  <p>What about protecting your organization&rsquo;s
				    identity? In a world where you can be anybody or anything, how can you
				    guarantee the authenticity of the museum organization&rsquo;s representation
				    or the accuracy and editorial integrity of the content and experiences
				    you create there? These are important questions which will ultimately
				    be addressed by a combination of user, role, and rights management functions
				    in the Second Life software platform (many such functions exist today),
				    institutional experience interacting in the community, and practices
				    for representing organizations and content published in Second Life and
				    virtual worlds beyond.</p>

				        312: </h3>
				  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">It&rsquo;s November 8, 2006. The
				        Exploratorium streams a Web cast of a rare planetary
				    transit of Mercury into Second Life (<a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/transit/">http://www.exploratorium.edu/transit/</a>).
				      In a transit, the planet Mercury is seen to move across
				        the face of the sun as viewed from earth. We stream the
				    transit video live from telescopes at the National Optical Astronomy
				    Observatory (NOAO) at Kitt Peak, near Tucson, Arizona, into the presentation
				        center at the International Spaceflight Museum (ISM).
				    There, avatars from around the world gather to watch the transit video
				    shown on the movie screens in SL and on the Exploratorium&rsquo;s Web
				    site. However, the avatars in SL have an advantage over people just viewing
				        the transit on the Web: Exploratorium scientist avatar
				    Patio Plasma is standing on stage answering questions from the audience
				    as the transit progresses. The questions come from avatars of people
				    with a wide range of backgrounds, from high school students to professional
			          astronomers. </p>
				  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig8" id="Fig8"></a><a href="rothfarb.fig8.html"><img src="rothfarb.fig8a.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="400" height="245" border="0" class="caption" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 8: Avatar scientist Patio Plasma shows a planetary
				    orbit model as avatars at the International Spaceflight Museum gather
				    to watch live telescope video of a transit of Mercury across the sun.</p>
				  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"><em>The virtual world allows scientist
				        Patio to interact with people from all over the world, and to create
				        a three-dimensional model of the orbit of the planet Mercury hanging
				        over the stage. Avatars fly up and examine the orbiting planet. Having
				        a three-dimensional exhibit of the orbit of Mercury helps show why
				        transits are rare. Thus, the capabilities of SL make the presentation
				        easy to create in three-dimensional detail.&nbsp; (SL resident Amulius Lioncourt, a physicist and expert
				      builder, created the Planet Orbit Plotter.) In addition, audience members
				      send IMs to each other during the presentation and chat about what
				      they&rsquo;re seeing. The Exploratorium streams the entire five-hour
				      transit into SL with voice commentary by scientist Ron
				      Hipschman. During the final three hours, questions from the audience
				      are answered by Patio.</em></p>
				  <p>Scaling of audiences is also an important issue.
				    How can you provide for a large number of avatars in your space in the
				    world? Can it scale to the level of simultaneous visitors your Web site
				    can accommodate? The Second Life platform has been available since 2003,
				    and while rapid growth and feature enhancements constantly improve stability
				    and content security, Linden Labs has not yet engineered the platform
				    to scale to hundreds or thousands of avatars in a sim, the containing
				    environments for different regions of the world. You can replicate content
				    across multiple sims, however, and use ticketing and group management
				    functions to provide access to specific areas. Since you can use any
				    external servers you control to bring streaming and on-demand audio and
				    video into Second Life, you can provide for scaling of these components
				    using common techniques such as high-connection-count media servers,
				    load balancing, and content delivery or edge networks.</p>
				  <p>Another powerful aspect of multi-user virtual worlds
				    like Second Life is that you can watch residents interact with your content
				    in real time. You can prototype exhibits and spaces and get important
				    feedback about use patterns and design effectiveness.&nbsp; Audiences
				    in virtual worlds are typically interested in being asked questions,
				    and often welcome invitations to participate. Planned public programs
				    can add an important dimension to your virtual museum and increase the
				    level of contact you have with the community. While overall, virtual-world
				    member audiences are not on the same scale as large Web sites, the time
				    individuals spend with in-world content can be significant, and there
				    is a benefit from the immediacy of learning how residents use and interact
				    with content. </p>

				  <h1>What to Build? </h1>
				  <p>There are now many Fortune 500 companies as well
				    as universities with presences in Second Life who are putting their messages
				    out there, establishing their brands and identities, and learning to
				    engage residents with their products and ideas. For museums in Second
				    Life, there is a unique set of challenges to being present in this rapidly
				    evolving virtual world. As in the Web environment, you can choose to
				    have a minimal presence that simply helps advertise your real-life museum,
				    or you can build out larger exhibits and spaces to enable deeper levels
				    of engagement with residents. In this tiered view (from simple to complex),
				    you can see possible ways to build a physical presence in Second Life:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>Design Native constructions (on owned or leased
				      land) </li>
				    <li>Place a sign or object advertising the museum
				      or a real-life exhibit/exhibition, linking to the museum&rsquo;s Web
				      presence (can be animated)</li>
				    <li>Offer a single exhibit</li>
				    <li>Offer a group of exhibits organized as an exhibition
				      or a collection </li>
				    <li>Offer meeting space for discussions and presentations</li>
				    <li>Offer event spaces</li>
				    <li>Seed an island campus with many or all of the
				      above (includes largest set of geometric building blocks,
				      called prims, in a single space; user management controls)</li>
				    <li>Populate a group of islands (may be contiguous)</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>Time-based external media, such as video and radio
				    (and other audio programs), can also be brought into SL, presented on
				    owned or leased land, made available to other locations, and be streamed
				    live or available on-demand.</p>
				  <p>Taking models of interaction as much from the exhibit
				    floor as from 2D Web-based design, virtual worlds like Second Life also
				    offer real-time social models, so it&rsquo;s easy to bring Web casts,
				    lectures, films, and other types of public programming into virtual visitors&rsquo; experience.
				    Physical space designers and architects can help you think through ways
				    to lay out a museum&rsquo;s virtual-world spaces. Platform experts and
				    other experienced SL residents can provide invaluable technical and usability
				    insight into designing structures, places, and scripts. Land owners can
				    give you the lay of the land regarding groups, access and object modification
				    rights, and logistics for events. </p>
				  <p>Once you start to establish a presence in SL, you&rsquo;ll
				    find fairly quickly that ongoing interaction with other residents &ndash; including
				    other museums and educators &ndash; is important to staying in touch
				    with the community and keeping your content and programming relevant.
				    Since the SL environment is inherently a social place, you can take advantage
				    of guilds or associations and communities of interest that have already
				    organized, or you can start your own. Read newspapers and blogs like &ldquo;New
				    World Notes&rdquo; (<a href="../http://nwn.blogs.com/" target="_blank">http://nwn.blogs.com</a>).
				    Participate in community Web sites like Second Life Forums
				    (<a href="../http://forums.secondlife.com/" target="_blank">http://forums.secondlife.com</a><span class="MsoHyperlink">),</span> SLuniverse
				    (<a href="../http://sluniverse.com/" target="_blank">http://sluniverse.com</a>),
				    and SimTeach (<a href="../http://simteach.com/" target="_blank">http://simteach.com</a>).
				    Go to real-life gatherings of enthusiasts, such as Second
				    Life Community Conventions. </p>
				  <p>For a colorful and insightful history of the Internet&rsquo;s
				    first wave of virtual worlds, read Bruce Damer&rsquo;s book, <em>Avatars!
				    Exploring and Building Virtual Worlds on the Internet.</em> While most
				    of the worlds Damer writes about have come and gone, many features of
				    Second Life are based on similar features in predecessor worlds. Damer&rsquo;s
				    stories of the social interactions in early avatar cyberspaces, and the
				    discussion on questions and concepts of world building, can give you
				    a valuable perspective on Second Life and other virtual worlds today.</p>
				  <h2>So After You Build A Virtual Museum, What Then?</h2>
				  <p>Since the point, in part, is to do something more
				    than a 3D simulation of a real life or imagined place, taking your effort
				    to the next level will most probably involve understanding how to give
				    residents a reason to come to your space, or to come back if they&rsquo;ve
				    visited previously. Many of the techniques you might be using on your
				    Web site to do this still apply. Keeping the space fresh with new content
				    and programming is important. In-world and Web-site advertising and cooperative
				    linking are good tools.</p>
				  <p>Keep in mind that the real-life people whose avatars
				    you encounter are likely to have cell phone cameras, active YouTube<sup>TM</sup> and
				    MySpace<sup>TM</sup> accounts,
				    and DVRs, and are often avid gamers. Many of these residents will show
				    up ready to be engaged by opportunities to create and tinker, or to tell
				    stories. Designing exhibits and public programs that allow participants
				    to build, share images and video, or make machinima (movies made entirely
				    in virtual worlds, see <a href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima</a>)
				    can challenge these content makers in many ways. </p>
				  <p>Think about letting people be expressive within
				    the level of appropriateness for your venue. Over time, tools will become
				    more robust and be seamlessly integrated with the user interface, making
				    it easier for residents to be expressive. Personal voice audio and video
				    will likely re-emerge in virtual worlds like Second Life, offering different
				    social dynamic and interaction possibilities. (For examples of this,
				    see information about the virtual world software called Traveler at the
				    DigitalSpace Traveler Web site <a href="../http://www.digitalspace.com/products/traveler.html" target="_blank">http://www.digitalspace.com/products/traveler.html</a>,
				    and NTT&rsquo;s virtual world software called InterSpace, as discussed
				    in Damer, 1998 &ndash; two prior virtual worlds with these capabilities).
				    Finding ways to connect content and community elements that you create
				    and make available to this type of participant is key to leveraging the
				    unique qualities of the environment.&nbsp; </p>
				  <p>In her essay &ldquo;Post Virtual Reality: After
				    the hype is over, what we have learned from VR,&rdquo; (Laurel, 1993),
				    Brenda Laurel writes:</p>
				  <p class="BlockQuote">In shared virtual worlds, structural elegance becomes
				    much less about the progression of events and more about facilitating
				    the emergence of patterns and relationships&hellip;Given a multisensory
				    environment that is good enough, people engage in projective construction
				    that is wildly elaborate and creative. And so this turns the problem
				    on its head; rather than figuring out how to provide structure with pleasing
				    emotional textures, the problem becomes one of creating an environment
				    that evokes robust projective construction.</p>
				  <p>In this context, it&rsquo;s important to consider
				    that the power of virtual worlds like Second Life is in the transformative
				    experiences residents can have for themselves by creating content and
				    by shaping both their spaces and their identities physically and temporally.</p>
				  <p><em><strong>A Year in the (Second) Life &ndash; Day
				        348:</strong></em></p>
				  <p><em>On a random day, Patio visits the 'Splo,
				      an activity she loves to do, and interacts with visitors. The 'Splo
				      has many exhibits built by Patio, Aimee Weber, Demarco Spatula, Treat
				      Luke, and other collaborators. YM, a Finnish neuroscientist working
				      in Japan, visits the illusions exhibited in the 'Splo. YM loves
				      illusions. In talking with her, Patio finds out that she wants to create
				      a transparent human skull in SL that will allow people to see three-dimensional
				      views of neural pathways as they process images over time to perceive
				      illusions. It turns out that visiting the 'Splo has strengthened
				      her desire to do this &ndash; and that&rsquo;s the kind of thing we&rsquo;ve
				      all been hoping for.</em></p>
