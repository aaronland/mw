  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>The main objective of the MultimediaN E-Culture project is
to demonstrate how novel Semantic Web and presentation technologies can be
deployed to provide better indexing and search support within large virtual
collections of cultural-heritage resources. The architecture is fully based on
open Web standards, in particular XML, SVG, RDF/OWL and SPARQL. One basic
hypothesis underlying this work is that the use of explicit background
knowledge in the form of ontologies/vocabularies/thesauri is in particular
useful in information retrieval in knowledge-rich domains such as cultural
heritage.&nbsp; This paper gives some details about the internals of the demonstrator.
The on-line version of the demonstrator can be found at:
<a href="../http://e-culture.multimedian.nl/demo/search" target="_blank">http://e-culture.multimedian.nl/demo/search</a>.</p>

  <p>Readers are encouraged to first take a look at the
demonstrator before reading on. As a teaser we have included a short
description of basic search facilities in the next section. We suggest you
consult the tutorial (linked from the on-line demo page) which provides a
sample walk-through of the search functionality. The current version of the
demonstrator runs under Firefox 2.0. It runs also under other browsers, but
users may experience some problems with the SVG support. We expect these SVG
problems to be solved in all main browsers in the near future. As a project we
are committed to Web standards (such as SVG) and are not willing to digress to
(and spend time on) special-purpose solutions. </p>

<p>Please note that this is a product of an ongoing project.
Visitors should expect the demonstrator to change. The project has a duration
of 4 years and is at the time of writing 18 months underway. We are incorporating
more collections and vocabularies and are also extending the annotation,
search, and presentation functionalities. </p>

<p >This demonstrator won the Semantic Web Challenge
(<a href="../http://challenge.semanticweb.org/" target="_blank">http://challenge.semanticweb.org</a>) at last year&rsquo;s International Semantic Web Conference,
held in November 2006 in Athens, Georgia. This paper is a revised version of
the description of this Challenge contribution. </p>

<h2>2. A Peek at the Demonstrator</h2>
<p >Figure 1 shows a query for &ldquo;Art Nouveau&rdquo;. This query will
retrieve images that are related to Art Nouveau in some way. The results shown
in the figure are &ldquo;created by an artist with a matching style''. So, these
images are paintings by artists who have painted in the Art-Nouveau style, but
the style is not part of the metadata of the image itself. This may retrieve
some paintings which are not really Art Nouveau, but it is a reasonable
strategy if there are no (or only few) images directly annotated with Art
Nouveau. We view the use of such indirect semantic links as a potential for
semantic search (for more details on path search in the demonstrator, see
Section @@todo-path-search). </p>

<p >The lower part of the figure shows a listing of painters who
are known to have worked in the Art-Nouveau style. The time line indicates
years in which they have created art works (you can click on them to get
information). </p>

<p class=caption><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><a href="ossenbruggen-fig1.html"><img src="ossenbruggen.fig1.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 1: Results of query for &ldquo;Art Nouveau&rdquo;" width="400" height="300" border="0" /></a> </p>

<p class=caption>Fig 1: Results of query for &ldquo;Art Nouveau&rdquo;</p>

<p class=caption><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><a href="ossenbruggen-fig2.html"><img src="ossenbruggen.fig2.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 2: Information about the indexing term &ldquo;Gold&rdquo;, showing also images that are related to &ldquo;Gold&rdquo;" width="400" height="216" border="0" /></a> </p>

<p class=caption>Fig 2: Information about the indexing term &ldquo;Gold&rdquo;, showing
also images that are related to &ldquo;Gold&rdquo;</p>

<p >Images have annotations in which terms from various thesauri
are used. Figure 2 shows the information a user gets when selecting such an
indexing term, here &ldquo;Gold&rdquo; material from the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus.
We also show images that have been annotated with this indexing term (or
semantically related terms). </p>

<p >Figure 3 shows a snapshot of the facet browser. Here we have
opted to look for &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; as a &ldquo;depicted place&rdquo;, i.e. art works with Paris as
subject. As we see, the demonstrator also finds artworks about Montparnasse and
Montmartre, as the THN thesaurus indicates that these are part of Paris. We can
use the TGN hierarchy to navigate to higher or lower parts in the hierarchy,
e.g. to France. This browser would then show all art works with (some part of)
France as subject. We can also cross-index it with other facets, e.g. all works
of an expressionist style showing Paris. </p>

<p class=caption><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a><a href="ossenbruggen-fig3.html"><img src="ossenbruggen.fig3.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 3: Facet browser snapshot, showing art works depicting &ldquo;Paris&rdquo;" width="400" height="330" border="0" /></a> </p>

<p class=caption>Fig 3: Facet browser snapshot, showing art works depicting
&ldquo;Paris&rdquo;</p>

<p >These are some basic search and presentation functions. The
reader is referred to the on-line demo for information about more search
options, such as time-based ones. We also have an experimental search function
for finding the semantic relations between two URIs,
e.g. for posing the question &rdquo;How are Van Gogh and Gauguin related?'' In fact,
this leads to a whole avenue of new search possibilities and related issues
with respect to which semantic paths are most relevant, and which we hope to
explore in more detail in the coming years. </p>

<h2>3. Technical Architecture</h2>
<p >The foundation of the demo is formed by SWI-Prolog and its
(Semantic) Web libraries (for detailed information, see Wielemaker 2003, 2005).
SPARQL-based access is a recent feature. The technical architecture of the
demonstrator is depicted in Figure 4. The &ldquo;Application Logic&rdquo; module defines
searching and clustering algorithms using Prolog as query language, returning
the results as Prolog Herbrand terms. The &ldquo;Presentation Generation&rdquo; module
generates Web documents from the raw answers represented as Herbrand terms. </p>

<p class=caption><img src="ossenbruggen.fig4.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 4: Technical architecture of the demonstrator" width="400" height="230" /></p>

<p class=caption>Fig 4: Technical architecture of the demonstrator (<a href="ossenbruggen.fig4.pdf">PDF</a>) </p>

<p >From the user perspective, the architecture provides&nbsp; </p>
<ol>
<li>
annotation facilities for Web resources representing images, and&nbsp; </li>

<li>
search and presentation/visualization facilities for finding images. </li>
</ol>
<h2>4. Vocabularies and Collection Data</h2>
<h3>4.1 Vocabularies</h3>
<p >Currently, the demonstrator hosts four thesauri, namely the
three Getty vocabularies (<a href="../http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/" target="_blank">http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/</a>),
i.e., the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), the Union List of Artists
Names (ULAN) and the Thesaurus of Geographical Names (TGN), as well as the
lexical resource WordNet, version 2.0. The Getty thesauri were converted from
their original XML format into an RDF/OWL representation using the conversion
methods principles as formulated by van Assem <em>et al.</em> (2004). The RDF/OWL
version of the data models is available on-line (see <a href="../http://e-culture.multimedian.nl/resources/" target="_blank">http://e-culture.multimedian.nl/resources/</a>).
The Getty thesauri are licensed. The project has acquired licenses for the
thesauri. People using the demonstrator do not have access to the full thesauri
sources, but can use them to annotate and/or search the collections. </p>

<p >The RDF/OWL conversion of WordNet is documented in a
publication of the W3C Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group
(van Assem, 2006). It is an instructive example of the issues involved in this
conversion process, in particular the recipes for publishing RDF vocabularies
(Miles et al., 2006).</p>

<p >The architecture is independent of the particular thesauri
being used. We are currently in the process of adding the Dutch version of AAT,
amongst others, to support a multi-lingual interface. Integration of other
(multi-lingual) thesauri is planned.</p>

<p >Using multiple vocabularies is a baseline principle of our
approach. It also raises the issue of alignment between the vocabularies.
Basically, semantic interoperability will increase when semantic links between
vocabularies are added. Within the Getty vocabularies, one set of links is
systematically maintained: places in ULAN (e.g., place of birth of an artist)
refer to terms in TGN. Within the project we are adding additional sets of
links. One example is links between art styles in AAT (e.g. &quot;Impressionism'')
and artists in ULAN (e.g., &ldquo;Monet&rdquo;). De Boer (2006) has worked on deriving
these semi-automatically from texts on art history. </p>

<p >Finding semantic links between thesauri is part of the
overall research efforts in ontology alignment: see, for example, the Ontology
Alignment Evaluation Initiative (<a href="../http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/" target="_blank">http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/</a>). This is
still a hard topic on its own, and the project intends to rely mainly on
specialized efforts in this area to provide methods and techniques for semantic
interoperability of vocabularies. On such efforts in the Dutch context is the
STITCH project (<a href="../http://www.cs.vu.nl/stitch" target="_blank">http://www.cs.vu.nl/stitch</a>).</p>

<h3>4.2 Annotation Template</h3>
<p >For annotation and search purposes, the tool provides the
user with a description template derived from the VRA 3.0 Core Categories
(Visual Research Association, 2000). The VRA template is defined as a
specialization of the Dublin Core set of metadata elements, tailored to the
needs of art images. The VRA Core Categories follow the &ldquo;dumb-down&rdquo; principle;
i.e., a tool can interpret the VRA data elements as Dublin Core data elements.
An unofficial OWL specification of the VRA elements, including links to Dublin
Core, can be found at <a href="../http://e-culture.multimedian.nl/resources/" target="_blank">http://e-culture.multimedian.nl/resources/</a> .</p>

<h3>4.3 Collection Data And Metadata</h3>
<p >In principle, every Web resource with a URL can
be included and annotated in the virtual collection of our demonstrator. As a
test set of data we have included three Web collections: </p>
<ul>
<li>
The Artchive collection (<a href="../http://www.artchive.com/" target="_blank">http://www.artchive.com/</a>) contains
around 4,000 images of paintings, mainly from the 19th and 20th century.</li>

<li>
The ARIA collection (<a href="../http://rijksmuseum.nl/aria/" target="_blank">http://rijksmuseum.nl/aria/</a>) of the
Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam contains images of some 750 master pieces.</li>

<li>
The RMV collection (<a href="../http://www.rmv.nl/" target="_blank">http://www.rmv.nl</a>) of the &ldquo;Rijksmuseum voor
Volkenkunde&rdquo; (State Museum for Ethnology) in Leiden describes about 80,000
images of ethnographic objects that belong to various cultures worldwide. </li>
</ul>
<p >For the Artchive items, we have used a parsing technique to
transform the existing textual annotation into a semantic annotation; i.e.
matching strings from the text to concepts from the various thesauri. </p>

<p >The metadata that accompanies the Artchive collection
consists of a short file holding textual values for title, creator, dimensions,
material, year of creation, location and comments. Unfortunately the descriptor
name is not specified with the value, and not all descriptions have the same
values in the same order. We used a grammar to parse and canonize the date of
creation and dimension fields. Author and material are matched to ULAN and AAT
using a syntactic distance measure and selecting the best match. </p>

<p >For example, a famous painting of Matisse depicting his wife
has the following textual annotation in Artchive:</p>

<p class="BlockQuote">MATISSE, Henri<br />
Green Stripe (Madame Matisse)<br />
1905<br />
Oil and tempera on canvas<br />
15 7/8 x 12 7/8 in.<br />
Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Copenhagen</p>

<p >The resulting semantic annotation is shown in Figure 5. The
&ldquo;Style/period&rdquo; property is not included in the original annotation text, but
can be derived from the artist-style links present in the background knowledge.
</p>

<p class=caption><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a><a href="ossenbruggen-fig5.html"><img src="ossenbruggen.fig5.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 5: Metadata about the sample Matisse painting. The VRA properties are shown on the left; their values on the right. The values are prepended with the name space of the vocabulary that&nbsp;provides the term. For example, &ldquo;ulan:Matisse, Henri;&rdquo; refers to the ULAN entry for Henri Matisse." width="400" height="226" border="0" /></a></p>

<p class=caption>Fig 5: Metadata about the sample Matisse painting. The VRA
properties are shown on the left; their values on the right. The values are
prepended with the name space of the vocabulary that&nbsp; provides the term.
For example, &ldquo;ulan:Matisse, Henri;&rdquo; refers to the ULAN entry for Henri Matisse.</p>

<p >For the other collections, we used similar strategies for
enriching the original metadata with semantic categories. Adding a collection
thus involves some information-extraction work on the metadata. In addition,
the demonstrator supplies a manual-annotation interface which can be used to
annotate any image on the Web.</p>

<h2>5. Distributed Vs. Centralized Collection
  Data</h2>
<p >The architecture is constructed to support multiple
distributed image collections. Data (i.e. images) must have an external URI (we
keep local copies, but that's only for caching). Ideally, we would like to get
the original metadata also from external sources using standard protocols such
as OAI (<a href="../http://www.openarchives.org/" target="_blank">http://www.openarchives.org/</a>). In practice however, we encountered
several problems with the quality of metadata retrieved via OAI, so for the
moment we still depend on the local copy of the original metadata.</p>

<p >Metadata extensions are also stored locally. In the future
we hope to feed these back to the collection owners. </p>

<p >Vocabularies form a separate problem. The Getty vocabularies
are licensed, so we cannot publish the full vocabulary as is. However, the
information in the Getty vocabularies is freely accessible through the Getty
online facilities; see, for example, <a
href="../http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/aat/" target="_blank">http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/aat/</a>
for access to the AAT.</p>

<p >We hope that these vocabularies will become publicly
available. In the meantime, our demonstrator allows you to browse the
vocabularies as a semantic structure and search for images semantically related
to a vocabulary item (see Figure 2 for an example of the concept &ldquo;Gold&rdquo; from
AAT). An RDF/OWL version of WordNet has recently been published (see above). We
will move within the next months to this version (the same version as we are
now using but with a different base URI). </p>

<h2>6. Keyword Search With Semantic Clustering</h2>
<p >One of the goals of the demonstrator is to provide users
with a familiar and simple keyword search, but still allow them to benefit from
all background knowledge from the underlying thesauri and taxonomies. The
underlying search algorithm consists of several steps that can be summarized as
follows. </p>
<ol>
<li>
First, it checks all RDF literals in the repository for matches on the
given keyword.</li>

<li>
Second, from each match, it traverses the RDF graph until a resource of
interest is found: we refer to this as a &quot;target resource&quot;. </li>

<li>
Finally, based on the paths from the matching literals to their target
resources, the results are clustered.</li>
</ol>
<p >To improve performance in finding the RDF literals that form
the starting points, the RDF database maintains a btree index of words
appearing in literals to the full literal, as well as a Porter-stem and
metaphone (sounds-like) index to words. Based on these indexes, the set of
literals can be searched efficiently on any logical combination of word,
prefix, by-stem and by-sound matches (see
  <a href="../http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/semweb.html#sec:3.8" target="_blank">http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/semweb.html#sec:3.8</a>).</p>

<p >In the second step, which resources are considered of
interest is currently determined by their type. The default settings return
only resources of type artwork (&ldquo;vra:Work&rdquo;), but this can be overridden by the
user. To avoid a combinatorial explosion of the search space, a number of
measures had to be taken. Graph traversal is done in one direction only: always
from the object in the triple to the corresponding subject. Only for properties
with an explicit owl:inverseOf
relation is the graph also traversed in the other direction. While this
theoretically allows the algorithm to miss out many relevant results, in practice
we found that this is hardly an issue. In addition to the direction, the search
space is kept under control by setting a threshold. Starting with the score of
the literal match, this score is multiplied by the weight assigned to the
property being traversed (all properties have been assigned a (default) weight
between 0 and 1), and the search stops when the score falls under the given
threshold. This approach not only improves the efficiency of the search, but
also allows filtering out results with paths that are too long (which tend to
be semantically so far apart that users do not consider them relevant anymore).
By setting the weights to non-default values, the search can also be fine tuned
to a particular application domain.</p>

<p >In the final step, all results are clustered based on the
path between the matching literal and the target result. When the paths are
considered on the instance level, this leads to many different clusters with
similar content. We found that clustering the paths on the schema level
provides more meaningful results. For example, searching on keyword &quot;fauve''
matches works from Fauve painters Matisse and Derain. On the instance level,
this results in different paths: </p>

<p class="code">dc:creator -&gt; ulan:Derain -&gt; glink:hasStyle -&gt; aat:fauve
-&gt; rdfs:label -&gt; &quot;Fauve&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p class="code">dc:creator -&gt; ulan:Matisse -&gt; glink:hasStyle -&gt;
aat:fauve -&gt; rdfs:label -&gt; &quot;Fauve&quot;</p>

<p >while on the schema level, this becomes a single path:</p>

<p class="code">dc:creator -&gt; ulan:Person -&gt; glink:hasStyle -&gt;
aat:Concept -&gt; rdfs:label -&gt; &quot;Fauve&quot;</p>

<p >The paths are translated to English headers that mark the
start of each cluster, and this already gives users an indication of why the
results match their keyword. The path given above results in the cluster title,
&ldquo;Works created by an artist with matching AAT style''. To explain the exact
semantic relation between the result and the keyword searched on, the instance
level path is displayed when hovering over a resulting image.</p>

<h2>7. Vocabulary And Metadata Statistics</h2>
<p >Table 1 shows the number of triples that are part of the vocabularies
and metadata currently being used by the demonstrator. The table has three
parts: </p>
<ol>
<li>
the schemas (e.g. the RDF/OWL schema for WordNet defining notions
such as &ldquo;SynSet&rdquo;), </li>

<li>
the vocabulary entries and their relationships, and </li>

<li>
the collection metadata. </li>
</ol>
<p >In total, these constitute a triple set of roughly 9,000,000
triples. We plan to extend this continuously as more collections (and
corresponding vocabularies) are being added. </p>
