				  <h1>Introduction</h1>
			  <p>Museums have long been on the forefront of creating
				    interactive narratives for the Web. Arguably all museums have a mandate
				    bring their collections and history to life and to educate the public.
				    In its brief history the Web has evolved into a much broader and more
				    complex medium. Advances in technology in both design and delivery are
				    allowing museums to tell more complex and sophisticated stories. These
				    advances bring more talent in to the fold and more tools to use. It is
				    now possible to tell stories that are incredibly rich, immersive and
				    increasingly interactive. Advertising agencies and multinational corporations
				    have raced into the narrative space and dumped huge sums of money into
				    creating high-end sites that showcase the richness and possibility of
				    the medium. On the other side of the spectrum, there have been movements
				    towards syndication and the separation of content from design, allowing
				    faster distribution of content. This evolution and these advances can
				    be both inspiring and intimidating. So how does a museum, with its staff,
				    navigate this new territory? What are the best tools to use, and what
				    is their learning curve? Should museums continue to invest in creating
				    interactive narratives; and if so how, when and why? </p>
				  <h1>The Interactive Narrative:
				      What the Heck is it?</h1>
				  <p>Before we can go into a full exploration of the
				    interactive narrative, it may be best to first define what is meant when
				    we use the term. The case could be made that everything is interactive
				    to some degree and can be told in the form of a narrative. And to go
				    further, we could even say that the mother of interactive narrative as
				    a genre is the humble hyperlink. A hyperlink is the function that initially
				    differentiated the Web from its brother the printed word; with a piece
				    of underlined text, a user could jump from one section of a story to
				    another. This was a revolution in the early 90s. Although Web sites employ
				    much more elaborate navigation techniques now, the basic concept of an
				    interactive narrative is the same. Interactive narratives by definition
				    provide the opportunity for a circuitous path through content.</p>
				  <p>For purposes of this paper, we will look at a subsection
				    from the great spectrum of sites on the Web that employ narrative techniques
				    to convey their message. In doing so, we acknowledge that the borders
				    may be hazy. To borrow Justice Potter Stewart&rsquo;s famously vague
				    litmus test for obscenity: &ldquo;I shall not today attempt further to
				    define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced . . . [b]ut
				    I know it when I see it . . . &quot;  (Justice Potter Stewart on
				    obscenity, 1964).</p>
				  <p>So acknowledging this, we will define the interactive
				    narrative as an on-line narrative site in which mood, multiple media,
				    and interaction work to create an immersive experience. </p>
				  <h1>The Current State of
				      Museums on the Web and How Interactive Narratives Fit In</h1>
				  <p>It is an exciting time to be making on-line narratives,
				    sometimes referred to as &lsquo;on-line Exhibitions&rsquo;. From our
				    vantage point as both Web and museum professionals, we can see two trends
				    developing for delivering informational or educational content. The first
				    trend is towards greater syndication and the separation of content from
				    design ;and the other, towards deeper, more engaging cinematic experiences. </p>
				  <p>Currently the prevailing trend in Web development
				    is towards the syndication of content. The prevalence of blogs, podcasts,
				    vodcasts, YouTube, Flickr, Drupal, SlideShowPro, SoundSlides, RSS and
				    other database-driven sites marks the age of the separation of content
				    from design. This has been an incredible development in that it has given
				    the power to the people. <em>Time Magazine</em>&rsquo;s
				    person of the year 2006 was &ldquo;You.&rdquo; This refers largely to
				    independent producers of Web content who have capitalized on the preponderance
				    of easy-to-use tools to deliver their message. On the Web development
				    front, standards compliant browsers and CSS have allowed for a greater
				    degree of design freedom while keeping the content free from unnecessary
				    markup and code. The result has been that more people can create content
				    for the Web, and a huge amount of content has been produced. For Museums
				    this is both good and bad. Web users have become accustomed to the regularity
				    of content change. They have often come to expect that after an increasingly
				    short amount of time, when they return to a site (whether it be their
				    favorite blogger or their favorite Museum site) the content will have
				    changed. The positive is that there are tools to make these changes easier.
				    The negative is that museums, which often contend with limited resources,
				    both budgetary and staff, scramble to keep up. The result is often database-driven,
				    template-driven sites. These can be beautiful and very effective, but
				    offer a very specific type of user experience &ndash; a more direct,
				    less &lsquo;immersive experience&rsquo;. This model is perfectly fine
				    for delivering much of the content a museum has to deliver and ensures
				    many happy &lsquo;customers&rsquo;. </p>
				  <p>On the other end of the spectrum, we have seen the
				    boundaries of the interactive narrative pushed forward by big corporations
				    and their equally enormous budgetary resources. These companies are utilizing
				    some of the brightest minds in the industry today to create powerful,
				    robust, experiential sites, and all this to sell shoes. </p>
				  <p>In the museum, where budgetary and staff constraints
				    reign, the aforementioned content delivery tools allow us easily to push
				    out the content that our visitors and our mandates depend on.When it
				    comes to more immersive sites, where we might lack experience with Web
				    tools and resources, the Museum does have some advantages: we are accustomed
				    to telling rich stories with multiple media, and have been doing so since
				    well before the advent of the Web . The Web, however, offers us an open
				    platform with which to share these stories. Edwin Schlossberg had it
				    right: &ldquo;True interactivity is not about clicking on icons or downloading
				    files, it's about encouraging communication&rdquo;  (Edwin Schlossberg).</p>
				  <p>So while the Museum may not have the enormous budgets
				    of some corporate entities, it is our stories that offer the deepest
				    advantage to user experience. Our collections, whether they be physical
				    artifacts, audio, or video content, give us a wealth of assets for telling
				    our stories. The Web, and the interactive narrative in particular, offer
				    up visceral opportunities to share our stories with visitors from all
				    over the world. This is the place for immersive educational content,  and
				    in some ways the Museum has always been on the forefront of shaping the
				    content on the Web. It is our contention that we, as Museum Educators,
				    SHOULD continue to make interactive narratives because the Web is an
				    effective medium for telling our stories with great impact. It has the
				    ability to reach many more visitors than any brick and mortar museum
				    exhibit ever could.</p>
				  <h1>Know Your Tools</h1>
				  <p>There has been considerable debate over which technology
				    is the best vehicle to deliver content. Within the museum and Web industries,
				    some people favor Flash, some favor HTML, some speak about usability,
				    others focus on interface and design. That said, it is the content and
				    the intent of the narrative that guides us towards deciding which tools
				    are best for a given project. </p>
				  <p>This debate on how to deliver content often puts
				    HTML and Flash at odds. These two delivery mediums have their advantages
				    and disadvantages, and with both evolving so rapidly, they each have
				    reputations they probably don&rsquo;t deserve. Flash in particular has
				    a bad reputation in certain circles and has had a hard time shaking its
				    image as a platform for overzealous designers to create unnecessary text
				    effects and obtuse interfaces. These interfaces seemed to ignore the
				    user experience and often sent users scrambling for the <strong>Skip
				    Intro</strong> button. In hindsight
				    we can all agree that certain early experiments in Flash were regrettable.
				    We might also remember that at the same time, HTML didn&rsquo;t offer
				    the designer many options, and the code was incredibly difficult to maintain.
				    Both HTML and Flash have improved significantly. Still, while HTML has
				    managed to more successfully dodge her sordid past, Flash too has grown
				    into a more sophisticated lady - but people are still afraid of her. </p>
				  <h2>Reasons
				        to Use HTML </h2>
				  <p>When HTML first arrived on the scene it was completely
				    text based, and over many years gradually integrated more sophisticated
				    content and design. HTML grew up in the browser and speaks directly to
				    the browser. Functions of the browser such as bookmarking, URL strings
				    and History were all created with HTML in mind. Today, many of the advantages
				    that HTML boasts over Flash have to do with its ability to handle text
				    and speak to the browser. Some of these advantages include integration
				    with screen readers and other types of accessibility tools compliant
				    with 501c3, more control over printing, user integration of site analysis,
				    innate use of browser history and bookmarks, ease of search engine optimization
				    and dynamic text sizing. All of this illuminates why HTML is often the
				    right choice for content delivery. AJAX has offered designers some more
				    control over interface and animation, but is still limited. </p>
				  <h2>Reasons
				        to Use Flash</h2>
				  <p>While HTML grew out of a text delivery medium in
				    the browser, Flash got its start as &lsquo;FutureSplash,&rsquo; a timeline-based
				    animation tool. It has since evolved into what can essentially be seen
				    as two powerful applications: the first, a timeline-based animation tool;
				    the second, a rich Internet application development platform with a robust
				    and sometimes daunting programming language, ActionScript. The principal
				    advantage of Flash has been its ability to integrate other media such
				    as video, audio and images, and to give the Web designer much greater
				    freedom with creating customized interfaces. However, many of the advantages
				    outlined above for HTML are nearly impossible to accomplish within the
				    Flash environment without a good amount of ActionScript. Bearing in mind
				    these limitations, Flash allows designers to create experiential and
				    sensory-driven Web sites that are not possible with HTML. In this way,
				    Flash lends itself perfectly to the creation of interactive narratives.</p>
				  <p>Flash can inspire great fear or great arrogance
				    in those sitting in the foothills of Flash development. There are people
				    who will look at a project created by 10 designers, 5 developers and
				    2 Motion Graphics artists, and say to themselves, &ldquo;Hell, I can
				    do that.&rdquo; There are others who,  upon hearing rumor that Flash
				    involves programming, will sit paralyzed with apprehension with an unopened
				    copy of Flash on their desk. So who can create Flash sites? Many museums
				    will base the answer to this question on its given resources. Some projects
				    lend themselves easily to in-house development and creation, while some
				    would be better served by an outside contract. Each project will usually
				    differ in scope and funding and timeline, and there is a vast range of
				    possibilities within the medium of the interactive narrative. For each
				    of the projects outlined below, Flash made the most sense due to the
				    proposed interface design and media interaction. </p>
				  <p>We suggest the contradiction is a false one: really,
				    you need some measure of both to create a good interactive narrative
				    Web site. </p>
				  <h1>How About the How</h1>
				  <p>In our experience with creating interactive narratives,
				    we have found it helpful to organize our goals for each project. While
				    the basic outline of these goals has been something we have followed
				    intuitively, MIT media labs worked to better define these into easy-to-follow
				    states. These guidelines are invaluable and help to shape the story and
				    presentation of the content into something truly useful and engaging. </p>
				  <h1>The Five Fundamental
				      Principles of Interactive Narrative </h1>
				  <ol>
				    <li>Narrative
				      Intention: The point of the narrative, or in the case of
				      an interactive narrative, the viewer experience. The narrative
				      intention should answer the viewer's question, &quot;Why am I viewing
				      this story?&quot; and
				      the author's question, &quot;Why am I telling it?&quot;</li>
				    <li>Narrative
				      Immersion: The quality of the viewer's reception of the
				      narrative. How do we manage interaction with the viewer
				      without distracting them from or otherwise disrupting the narrative.</li>
				    <li>Narrative
				      Structure: The form, shape and rhythm of the narrative.
				      As such, narrative structure is inherently a function of
				      the temporal nature of the narrating; it relates to the time of the
				      telling.</li>
				    <li>Narrative
				      Response: Encompasses the fundamental question for any
				      interactive narrative, &quot;How does the narrative respond to the
				      viewer?&quot; or
				      conversely, &quot;How does the viewer influence the narrative?&quot;</li>
				    <li>Narrative
				      Guidance: the culmination of each of the preceding properties;
				      it concerns the fundamental challenge of providing narrative
				      structure and responsiveness while preserving narrative intention and
				      immersion.</li>
				  </ol>

				  <h1>Case Studies</h1>
				  <p>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is a
				    federal institution created to advance and disseminate knowledge about
				    the tragedy of the Holocaust, to educate the public and encourage discourse
				    and reflection on a citizen&rsquo;s responsibilities in a democracy,
				    and to preserve and honor the memory of those who suffered and who died. </p>
				  <p>Our Museum is a very emotional space. The history
				    that the Museum represents is one of tragedy, loss and despair, but also
				    hope. Coming into the physical exhibits is an extremely visceral experience.
				    And while the Web cannot bring the physical building to visitors accessing
				    our site from their homes, we can try to create an intimate and experiential
				    environment for sharing the stories of the Holocaust. We want visitors
				    to <em>feel</em> the stories they watch,
				    or read, or hear. We want to try to engage them, to offer a sensory experience
				    that is more than just an informational resource. One of our ways to
				    accomplish this is to use &ldquo;voices&rdquo; as our guides into the
				    story. We have found that by focusing on the first person experience,
				    we are able to better present these stories. There are definitely times
				    that call for an omniscient narrator, but success in translating these
				    highly emotional and raw experiences comes from the first person voice,
				    giving commonality into the lives of our users. </p>
				  <h2>Life After the Holocaust<br />
				   (<a href="../http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/life_after_holocaust/" target="_blank">http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/life_after_holocaust/</a>) </h2>
				  <p>Even before construction began on the Museum, the
				    USHMM was collecting personal interviews with survivors of the Holocaust.
				    These testimonies are an essential part of the Museum&rsquo;s collection
				    and an incomparable resource for illuminating the tragedy of the war.
				    About 10 years ago, the Museum reached beyond the war years and began
				    recording oral history interviews with Holocaust Survivors, focusing
				    on their experiences and lives after the war. This collection has grown
				    and now includes hundreds of interviews. In 1995, the interviews which
				    would form with basis of <em>Life After Holocaust</em> were
				    collected. Six of these interviews were produced into 30-minute radio
				    segments. When our department became aware of these long-form interviews,
				    we jumped at the chance to share these stories with a larger audience.
				    In 2004, a producer and photographer were sent out to meet with the survivors,
				    collect historical photographs and take portraits. </p>
				  <p>Since we were determined to use a unique interface
				    with streaming audio, we decided that Flash would best serve the content
				    and presentation of these stories. In the early phase of this project,
				    bluecadet interactive was brought in to help develop the interface and
				    structure of the piece. From the beginning it was determined that the
				    audio files would serve as the centerpiece for the site. As we reviewed
				    the audio, it became evident that these stories not only were fascinating
				    and extremely raw in their telling, but also shared many common themes. </p>
				  <p>Each of the Survivors profiled in this piece came
				    to the United States shortly after the end of the war. They had all endured
				    great loss in their homelands and were now thrust into a new culture
				    and essentially new lives. We decided to use these common themes as the
				    structure for our story. Eventually we are arrived at five major themes:
				    Arriving in New York, Starting Over, Living with the Past, Telling their
				    Children, and Faith, Guilt &amp; Responsibility. </p>
				  <p>We organized the content into three levels; each
				    level was intended to appeal to a vast variety of user types and help
				    guide users deeper into the content. The first level allows users to
				    see the content organized by theme. We introduce the leaves and branches
				    to symbolize the paths that our subjects&rsquo; lives have taken. We
				    also use the leaves on this level as buttons which on roll-over play
				    short segments of audio drawn from the long audio pieces. The cacophony
				    of voices that  users can create by rolling over multiple leaves
				    exemplifies the vast collection of personal experiences that the Holocaust
				    shaped. </p>
				  <p>The second level allows the users to delve deeper
				    into the themes. Each theme level includes 30-60 second audio segments
				    related to the themes. As the audio plays, captions animate on tiny pieces
				    of paper, adding visual appeal to what could have been traditional caption
				    text. Each audio clip is synchronized with a photo-based animation which
				    includes historical photographs provided by the survivor. We felt that
				    by exploring these themes, we could illustrate the survivors&rsquo; shared
				    trauma and show how each survivor was affected differently by the past.
				    In some cases the survivors had similar perspectives on a theme; in other
				    cases their perceptions were radically different. Once users were pulled
				    into the excerpted content, we hoped it would further draw them into
				    the third level where we presented the full 30-minute audio interviews. </p>
				  <p>The third level, which included the 30-minute interview,
				    was also outfitted with an album containing photographs given to us by
				    each of the survivors profiled. We wanted to allow the users to engage
				    further with these stories and give them something visceral to explore
				    in order to bring them closer to the subject. These images also give
				    users something to do and click on while they listen to the audio. These
				    interviews were also made available in a downloadable mp3 format. The
				    mp3s serve as take-aways from the site and make it easier for users to
				    experience the content on portable audio devices. </p>
				  <p>Since the entire <em>After the Holocaust</em> site
				      is based on these large audio segments and a collection of historical
				      images and portraits, it was important to us to expand the boundaries
				      of interaction and provide an interface that would make these assets
				      more accessible for our users. To create this experiential narrative
				      the audio assets were edited and repurposed into smaller audio segments
				      for use on other levels. The photography was similarly cut up, manipulated
				      and repurposed to give the piece a unique look and feel.</p>
				  <h2><strong>Ripples
				        of Genocide: Journey Through Eastern Congo</strong> (<a href="../http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/congojournal/" target="_blank">http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/congojournal/</a>)</h2>
				  <p>This project came about due to unique circumstances.
				    Although it hasn't been well known, the USHMM has, as part of its mandate,
				    an interest in educating people about contemporary Genocide. So after
				    UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador and well-known actress Angelina Jolie traveled
				    to Eastern Congo to meet refugees from the Rwandan Genocide, along with
				    expert on the African crisis and former Clinton Administration Policy
				    Analyst John Prendergast, she decided to donate some personal journal
				    excerpts about the trip to the Museum so that we could use them to illustrate
				    the frightening situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
				    Subsequently, photographer Edward Parsons, also along on the journey,
				    donated some 25 photographs of Ms. Jolie, Mr. Prendergast and the people
				    they met along the way. When the Museum decided to create a Web site
				    about the journey and the people who were suffering in the DRC, we felt
				    we had a few great materials to work with but would need more &quot;stuff&quot; to
				    connect the dots and bring the story of the victims to life. And that
				    was our specific narrative intention, to bring attention to and illuminate
				    the current dire situation of people living in DRC for people living
				    in USA. It was important to sort out our exact intention from the beginning
				    of the project in order to direct our actions from there on.</p>
				  <p>Although normally (as previously mentioned) we feel
				    the best point of view from which to tell this kind of story is the point
				    of view of the victim, in this case we understood that we could use an
				    often less available vantage point - that of witnesses. Early on we realized
				    that the excerpts Ms. Jolie provided were wonderfully descriptive, but
				    it would be necessary to augment her perceptions with an expert analysis
				    as well. And further, we decided to tell one story from the parallel
				    points of view, kind of like on a movie DVD, when you can turn on and
				    off the commentary audio track. So we asked Ms. Jolie, and she was kind
				    enough to record her journal excerpts as audio. Mr. Prendergast recorded
				    audio for us to relate facts and context as companion pieces to Ms. Jolie's
				    observations. At this point we had also decided we should deliver the
				    audio along with visuals using flash so the story could &lsquo;flow&rsquo;,
				    and visitors to the site could sit back and listen to the voices.</p>
				  <p>More than this, we also felt we needed a story-telling
				    device in addition to more materials, to cultivate the possibility for
				    narrative immersion by visitors to the site. At this point, we had only
				    excerpts and now audio and a few photos which did not really illustrate
				    the topics Ms. Jolie was addressing. The photos we had did document,
				    to some degree, the people she had met, but not much more than that -
				    not the countryside she was describing nor the mood of her writings.
				    So we found another photographer, Laura Englebrecht, who had also been
				    to the Congo recently, albeit on a separate trip, but who was also willing
				    to donate the use of her photos. With the two photo contributions, we
				    could now give a much more complete visual component to what was being
				    described.</p>
				  <p>Still unsure of how to convey the seriousness and
				    emotion of the situation, we felt it would be appropriate to deliver
				    the content in the form it came to us, as a journal. We found inspiration
				    in the journals of Dan Eldon (http://www.daneldon.org/journals/), which
				    are some of the most elaborate, moving and personal expressions in publication
				    today. By incorporating collaged visual elements into the design of a
				    mock travel journal, we had now finally arrived at a structure for the
				    narrative that added even more context to either point of view - Ms.
				    Jolie's or Mr. Prendergast's. </p>
				  <p>The structure of this story has a traditional beginning,
				    middle, and end, even though the presentation is quite unconventional
				    for on-line exhibitions. And even though the story of their journey is
				    not the important information we want to convey, we use the structure
				    of a travel journal as a vehicle to convey our real message: if you,
				    average American, were able to go to the DRC, this is the terrible truth
				    you would see. These people are the victims of Genocide. </p>
				  <p>We wanted the effect of the collaged animated elements
				    - both visual and auditory (we also included some fantastic music generously
				    donated by the group Califone) - to stimulate visitors' multiple senses
				    at once, much the way multiple senses function on a real journey. But
				    in addition, we built in a few opportunities (not many) for visitors
				    to dig a bit deeper into some elements of the story. Visitors can get
				    more information about images by clicking. This is both standard and
				    expected. We also provide a few thoughtful &lsquo;questions&rsquo; that
				    visitors can choose to read or not. But the seminal narrative interaction
				    that is possible is for visitors to toggle back and forth to compare
				    Ms. Jolie's viewpoint with Mr. Prendergast's. We decided that would be
				    enough: the Web site did not need more ways to interact. Interacting
				    with the info in this site did not require clicking, given the animated
				    presentation.</p>
				  <p>Since the content and interface of the site needed
				    to be organic and cinematic, Flash was the only viable development tool
				    for this project. One major technical hurdle was that the audio tracks
				    would change frequently during the development of the project. Moreover,
				    the audio files also need to be synched with a transcript which also
				    would change as editorial and narrative choices were made. Responding
				    to these technical and production needs, bluecadet developed a customized
				    caption tool. Developed in Flash, it would import an external XML that
				    contained the caption information. It would then allow users with no
				    prior Flash knowledge to select breakpoints in the audio. The process
				    is as follows: </p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>The
				      caption appears on screen as the audio plays </li>
				    <li>After
				      reading the caption, the user presses &ldquo;spacebar&rdquo; to advance
				      the caption </li>
				    <li>When
				      the audio is complete, the caption tool exports a new XML
				      with the proper captions and timecodes. </li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>This made updating audios and transcripts much faster
				    and less prone to error. It also allowed timeline animations to be synched
				    to specific portions of the transcript and to be moved with ease. This
				    tool was built with modularity in mind and would actually be repurposed
				    in the &lsquo;<em>Life After Holocaust&rsquo; </em>project.</p>
				  <p>We tried again to have the voices of this project
				    come to life, to have the omniscient voice sink into the background and
				    bring the witness&rsquo; voices forward. The pages load in a random sequence,
				    creating a collage of memory as the witness&rsquo;s voice details a story.</p>
				  <h2>Yearbook 2006 <br />
				  (<a href="../http://www.y06.org/" target="_blank"><em>http://www.y06.org</em></a>)			      </h2>
				   <p>Often the process of developing an interactive narrative
				    will begin when a Museum department, wishing to highlight some portion
				    of its collection or assets,  initiates a project. This was not
				    the case with the Yearbook 2006 project. Instead, it started as an idea,
				    and the collection of assets to elucidate this idea came later. In this
				    way the Yearbook project can serve as a good example of how a site can
				    be developed from scratch, from idea to deliverable. </p>
				  <p>The mission of the Yearbook project was to document
				    and preserve the legacy of the graduating class of the Benjamin Franklin
				    High School in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. Using the interactive
				    narrative as the medium, the Yearbook project sought to give a cohesive
				    and layered forum to the fractured voices of those seniors who were displaced
				    and those who remained in New Orleans, aiming to, above all, educate
				    the public and to nurture and heal the vibrant social fabric that Katrina
				    threatened to destroy. </p>
				  <p>As stated above, the idea for this site predated
				    the collection of any assets. Senior staff at bluecadet, in conversation
				    with documentary photographers Joshua Cogan and David Lee, decided to
				    create an interactive narrative to explore the issue of displacement
				    and return in post-Katrina New Orleans. Cogan and Lee had remarked that
				    while there were many photo essays surrounding the devastation in New
				    Orleans, there were few projects that acknowledged the diversity of New
				    Orleans or followed a diverse community. The idea then evolved to follow
				    a high school, and later to follow high school seniors. Senior year at
				    any high school across this country is a major transitional period: a
				    period in which students reaffirm their community ties while, at the
				    same time, they prepare to separate from that community. Hurricane Katrina
				    prematurely forced this transition on thousands of seniors throughout
				    New Orleans. The metaphor of the yearbook seemed a natural extension
				    of the concept. This site would serve as yearbook for these students
				    to document their experiences surrounding the Hurricane. While Ben Franklin,
				    through tenacity and force of will, would develop its own traditional
				    yearbook, this on-line yearbook would tell a different story. We planned
				    to launch the site on August 30, on the one-year anniversary of the Hurricane.
				    We felt that this was a strong concept and we moved forward. </p>
				  <p>Many of the decisions on how we would deliver the
				    narrative came as we began developing content. We knew from the start
				    that we would have many high quality photographs to work with. After
				    all, we had partnered with two professional photographers. However, we
				    felt we would need to deliver these photographs in some novel way to
				    differentiate our story from the preponderance of audio slideshows developed
				    by such news organizations as NYTimes.com and WashingtonPost.com. It
				    also became clear that in order to tell the story, we would need to have
				    a range of photographs, from shots from within the school to pictures
				    of home and major events. Also, as New Orleans was in rapid change, we
				    needed to embed ourselves in the city and follow the students with some
				    regularity from Ben Franklin&rsquo;s opening day on January 17 until
				    graduation in May. This seemed to be the only way to get the assets we
				    needed to tell the story. Fortunately, we were able to develop a schedule
				    where Cogan and Lee would alternate times in New Orleans, and therefore
				    we were able to get a broad range of materials. Since we were partnered
				    with the photographers, and they retained rights to their photographs,
				    we were able to negotiate a discounted rate to keep this aspect of asset
				    collection from overwhelming our budget.</p>
				  <p>We also knew that we wanted to have the students
				    speak for themselves; we wanted to hear their voices. Initially we felt
				    that audio would be sufficient. We favored audio because we felt that
				    the photographs could serve as the visual component and the students
				    could speak to the photographs. However, we soon discovered two things.
				    One, in order to have the students speak to the photographs, we needed
				    to have the photographs in hand for the interview. Since we were constantly
				    taking pictures and the timeline was restricted, this would require numerous
				    interviews for each student. Two, many students chose to speak about
				    things that occurred during their dislocation or events in their pasts.
				    While we tried to secure as many assets as we could to illustrate these,
				    it became clear that audio would not be enough. This was reinforced when
				    after several amazingly compelling audio interviews where students revealed
				    so much character and emotion in their faces, we felt that we needed
				    to switch to video. In order to ensure that the video was clean and professional,
				    we employed a professional videographer to come to the school on two
				    occasions and set up lighting and audio. We interviewed all of the students
				    during this time, one after the other in rapid succession. It was exhausting
				    but cost effective. We also went out on our own and shot B-Roll footage
				    over five months to use in the video production.</p>
				  <p>After several months gathering assets, we started
				    into production in May. We knew that given the assets we would use Flash
				    as the development tool. We wanted to have a unique and fluid interface.
				    We wanted the site to be immersive and to incorporate video, photography,
				    dynamic maps, timelines and animation. We also knew that given the compressed
				    production timeline,  much of the content would be developed very
				    close to the launch of the site. For this reason we needed the site to
				    be very modular and to use graphic templates. We also knew that these
				    templates should be more or less invisible to the users and that we needed
				    to allow the layouts to be flexible and seem unique. Moreover, as part
				    of our funding agreement with one of our fiscal sponsors, we were to
				    deliver an early version of this site as a kiosk at the Spirit of Recovery
				    Conference in New Orleans. The solution was to create a very ActionScript
				    intense site that would be fed by XML. Keeping the data in XML would  make
				    it easy to add new content to the site as that content became available.
				    If we received new video, we just needed to add a new video node in the
				    XML and it would appear on the site. We could add in graphics dynamically
				    and position them based on parameters established in the XML. By having
				    a parameter for X position and Y position, we could place graphics wherever
				    we wanted on the screen, making each page seem as if it had a unique
				    design. XML can also reside locally on a machine, giving database-like
				    functionality without having to be connected to the Web; this is a great
				    asset for kiosks where Internet connection cannot always be assumed. </p>
				  <p>However successful we were at driving content to
				    the site, choosing not to align our project with a museum or trusted
				    cultural institution had some unexpected results. Even though the credits
				    listed bluecadet as the creator of the project, since the project had
				    not been directly attributed to a trusted media source and we had not
				    applied the omniscient voice, we received several laudatory e-mails assuring
				    us that we were indeed incredibly talented high school students. Even
				    though our team consisted of several award-winning designers and developers,
				    many with advanced degrees, the lack of organizational accreditation
				    and voice made this a common misconception. In subsequent usability studies
				    it became very clear that this was a common issue. Without the authoritative
				    or institutional voice clearly defined, users often chose to believe
				    that the subjects themselves were the authors of the work.</p>
				  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
				  <p>With the increasingly rapid development of Web technologies
				    it is daunting to predict the future of the Web. It does seem that the
				    trend towards syndication, the separation of content from design, will
				    continue, and that interfaces will become increasingly more sophisticated
				    and useable. Put simply, content producers and designers will always
				    want to deliver the most useable and elegant interfaces that also allow
				    for simple distribution of content, and the technologies that afford
				    them this power will thrive. Recently, Microsoft has begun to roll out
				    its next generation social networking platform, &lsquo;Wallop.&rsquo; This
				    platform offers an amazing integration of a fluid Flash interface with
				    the content control of a blog. Whether this venture will be successful
				    or not could very well be the subject of another paper; regardless, it
				    supports the claim that control of both interface and content will be
				    of paramount importance in the future. Also, it is our hope and contention
				    that Museums will continue to create rich and engaging experiences on
				    the Web . It is our mandate to educate, and we hope that we can embrace
				    the tools and techniques afforded to us to tell the best stories possible. </p>
