    <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
    <p class="abstractText">This paper addresses efforts to share traditional
      Tribal knowledge and history through an interactive on-line experience.
      It speaks to the need to reach a wide and far-reaching audience while not
      compromising the integrity of the information shared. Ntsayka Ikanum: A
      Virtual Experience weaves together stories and artifacts of the Confederated
      Tribes of Grand Ronde&rsquo;s history from the beginning of time to today.
      Told with moving multimedia, video, audio and photography, the virtual
      museum provides a place to go for Tribal members and the general public
      to hear and read the words and teachings of our ancestors. This collaborative
      effort teamed the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde with ISITE Design
      to develop a Web site that is a means of exhibiting Tribal collections
      and sharing cultural information until a Museum and Cultural Center can
      be built.</p>

      research, interactive, accessibility</p>
    <h1>Introduction: The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde</h1>
    <p>The need for a place to learn about the history and
      peoples that make up the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde has been growing
      exponentially over the years. This need was realized by the formalization
      of the Cultural Resources Department in 1996. The incredible richness of
      the material culture combined with the desire to have a means of sharing
      it prompted the idea of creating a &ldquo;virtual gallery&rdquo; to serve
      that purpose. <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story </em>was
      not intended as a substitute for a museum or a cultural center. Rather,
      it serves to encourage the perpetuation and celebration of our culture
      in a highly accessible way, with the aspiration of one day having a Grand
      Ronde Museum and Cultural Center.</p>
    <h1>ISITE Design</h1>
    <p>Leveraging interactive technology to help preserve
      a people&rsquo;s culture proved to be an exciting challenge for our interactive
      agency. Over a 12 month period we worked to immerse ourselves in the history,
      traditions and personalities that make the Confederated Tribes of Grand
      Ronde: not just a Native American tribe that has survived centuries of
      challenges, but one that has emerged as a genuine societal leader, championing
      charitable causes, caring for their elders, and improving their nation&rsquo;s
      educational system, all the while empowering their tribal members to succeed
      in the global community. </p>
    <p>From our perspective, it is best to start at the launch
      celebration where tribal members and elders experienced the project for
      the first time in a computer lab. Tears, smiles and numerous conversations
      were sparked as tribal elders retraced the history of Grand Ronde with
      first person audio, video and textual accounts. This paper seeks to paint
      the process and lessons learned from the <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story </em>adventure
      ISITE Design and Grand Ronde partnered to produce. </p>

    <h1>Tribal Profile &ndash; The Indian Peoples of the Grand Ronde Community</h1>
    <p>We believe our people have been here from time immemorial.
      With the coming of the settlers, the way we lived for tens of thousands
      of years was forever altered. The last 200 years of history saw more change
      than the previous 2,000 years. After a series of negotiations with the
      United States Federal Government in 1851 that resulted in broken promises
      and unratified treaties, the relatives and ancestors of the people who
      make up what is today the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde signed treaties
      that were ratified in the early to mid 1850&rsquo;s. These treaties include
      the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855 (otherwise known as the Treaty with
      the Kalapuya,) the Treaty with the Chasta of 1854, Treaty with the Umpqua
      and Kalapuya of 1854, Treaty with the Molalla of 1855, and the Treaty with
      the Rogue River of 1853 and 1854. The Grand Ronde Reservation was established
      by treaty on June 30, 1857. The Reservation was established for more than
      twenty-five different tribes and bands of peoples whose ancestral homeland
      was primarily western Oregon, as well as for some communities from extreme
      southwestern Washington and northern California. Some of these tribes included
      the Cascades, Clackamas and Tumwater from the Mid-Columbia and Lower Willamette
      Rivers; the Santiam, Tualatin, Yamhill, Kalapuya, Luckiamute, Hanchuyuk,
      Chepanefo, Chelamela, Winnefilly, and southern Yoncalla from the Willamette
      Valley; the Molalla bands from the Cascade Range; the Takelma, Umpqua and
      Rogue peoples from the Umpqua and Rogue River valleys; and the Tillamook
      from the Coast. </p>
    <p>The different peoples located on the Reservation were
      linguistically and culturally distinct. Seven Native American languages
      were spoken by early residents of the Grand Ronde community, including
      Athapaskan, Chinookan, Kalapuyan, Takelman, Salishan, Shastan and Sahaptian:
      there were at least 25 dialects. Most of the languages were unintelligible
      one to one another, and no population group was dominant. </p>
    <p>The original Grand Ronde Reservation consisted of
      69,000 acres of open valley, farmland and timber. By 1901 the reservation
      was reduced by 25,800 acres. Then through the Dawes Act and other detrimental
      government-sanctioned policies of the time, the Reservation was reduced
      even further. In 1954, the U.S. Congress terminated its government-to-government
      relationship with the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde altogether. Termination
      dispersed a large segment of the tribal community to urban and non-reservation
      areas and left the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde nearly landless.
      The only remaining tribal land, for the next 30 years, was a 5-acre cemetery. </p>
    <p>In 1974, a group of tribal members began an exhaustive
      effort to restore Grand Ronde&rsquo;s federal recognition, which was finally
      granted on November 22, 1983. The Grand Ronde Tribe was reborn, and the
      long journey to rebuild our community began. In 1988, the Tribes were granted
      9,811 acres of original reservation lands. Tribal membership currently
      consists of nearly 5,000 individuals. During the era of Termination, the
      federal government instituted not only a practice of, but also a policy
      of relocation which moved Indian people to urban centers in order for them
      to better assimilate into &ldquo;American&rdquo; culture. Since Restoration,
      the Grand Ronde Tribe has made efforts to bring families back home through
      housing and job training programs, but still a significant percentage of
      the Tribal population is dispersed throughout the Willamette Valley, Oregon,
      the rest of the United States, and beyond. Because of this circumstance,
      it was crucial that the mechanism developed to provide an educational resource
      for Tribal members as well as the general public transcend the geographical
      limitations of a rural Reservation. </p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 2. Ceded Lands of the Confederated Tribes of Grand
      Ronde. </p>
    <p>An experience common to Native communities across
      the United States, Tribal people have endured various nations&rsquo; and
      groups&rsquo; systematic suppression of local knowledge and culture, both
      conscious and unconscious. From the loss of traditional beliefs to shifts
      in material culture and, finally, language, Natives across the country
      have felt the impact of assimilation. Now we are faced with piecing together
      what was lost or disbursed (Haakanson, 2004). The Cultural Resources Department
      is committed to the protection, preservation, and promotion of the cultural
      heritage of the original people of the Grand Ronde community. The Tribe
      recognizes cultural resources are invaluable, irreplaceable, and should
      be treated as endangered resources. With the intent of preserving, protecting
      and revitalizing tribal culture, spirituality, and history, the Tribe established
      the Cultural Resources Department. Program staff is tasked with four primary
      objectives: cultural education, site protection, repatriation, and creating
      a comprehensive repository for all materials which have historic importance
      to the Grand Ronde Tribes.</p>
    <p>Since the establishment of the department, it has
      been our goal to become the primary repository for Grand Ronde related
      materials, be they archival historic documents, photographs, oral histories,
      ethnographies, maps, journals, or artifacts. Now that Tribal communities
      have access and the resources to repatriate our cultural heritage through
      the auspices of sovereignty and the application of federal laws such as
      NAGPRA, the avenue to be the arbiters of our own history is once again
      ours. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">We are obligated to protect sacred cultural knowledge,
      to respect our Elders, and to be conscious of the fact that some sacred
      knowledge is meant to be kept sacred and out of the public arena. If this
      means not sharing it with scholars and other visitors, then we must respect
      this. If we do not, we are no better than the non-Natives and the actions
      they took over the last two centuries. (Haakanson, 2004.) </p>
    <p>Providing a brief historical framework for understanding
      the history of collecting in American museums and its impact on Native
      people and culture is essential. Why is it that museums and archival institutions
      are the principal repositories of Tribal cultural heritage instead of Tribal
      people themselves? One reason is that the government mandated many laws
      and policies that were seriously detrimental to living communities. Beginning
      in the 1860&rsquo;s, the Army Medical Museum began collecting Indian bodies
      for the study of diseases. Trying to prove a correlation between race and
      intelligence in order to rank races according to brain size was a major
      undertaking. Field doctors were to send back Indian specimens, particularly
      crania, for study. In 1868, an agreement between the Army and Smithsonian
      was established. The Army would take the human remains and the Smithsonian
      would get the burial and cultural items. This started the long-term practice
      of taking crania and cultural items from massacre sites, battlefields,
      boarding school burial grounds, and sacred sites. </p>
    <p>Not only was the Federal Government at work &ldquo;collecting&rdquo; from
      Tribal people, but scholars and academics also took advantage. In 1867,
      George Peabody founded the first museum devoted to anthropology at Harvard.
      His goal was to educate the public through arts and museums, and he believed
      artifacts collected from Tribes could help do this. During the Collections
      Era (1875-1930), individuals went around collecting for museums from living
      people and cultures, as well as from burial sites. Museums wanted historic
      and religious objects: those items that were the most meaningful to communities.
      Attempts were made to purchase some, but even with disease, poverty, and
      punishment for practicing traditional religion, most native people would
      not sell. When individuals were found who were willing to sell, they were
      often under the influence of a new religion that did not value their own
      religion or their associated sacred objects: Christianity. Collectors resorted
      to burial sites as a major source for collections, as many native communities
      would bury an individual&rsquo;s most treasured things with the body. This &ldquo;work&rdquo; contributed
      significantly to the dehumanization of Tribal cultures and the disbursement
      of the most important cultural property of a community to institutions
      across not only the United States, but also the world. With the military
      enforcing such rules and private collectors at work, there was a mass removal
      of cultural material from living Indian communities. It took close to 100
      years for the first major wave of federal legislation to begin to protect
      Native American cultural materials. </p>
    <p>In the last 10 years, the Cultural Collections Program
      was formed in order to rectify the 150 years of cultural destruction and
      assimilation. The Program&rsquo;s goal was to work to preserve and perpetuate
      the cultural heritage of the original tribes of the Grand Ronde community
      by acquiring, managing, and protecting tribally affiliated collections
      through exhibition, loan, and repatriation. While traditional belief says
      it takes as long to fix a problem as it took to make it, a committed group
      of Tribal employees and contractors have put their minds and efforts towards
      that long-term goal. </p>

    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>To that end, <em>Ntsayka Ikanum </em><em>or</em><em> Our
        Story: A Virtual Experience</em> (<a href="../http://www.grandronde.org/culture/ikanum" target="_blank">http://www.grandronde.org/culture/ikanum</a>)
        was born of a dream that became reality when the Confederated Tribes
        of Grand Ronde submitted an application for the Administration for Native
        Americans Social and Economic Development Strategies grant in 2003. The
        primary motivation for the development of the virtual gallery was to
        improve the communications and education of Tribal members and the general
        public and to advance self-governance and cultural preservation. As part
        of the process developed for and highlighted in the grant application,
        various objectives were established. Assembling a project team was critical
        in order to address the various issues that were bound to surface. Some
        of those issues included access rights, security, sacrality, public versus
        tribal knowledge, and addressing the needs of a varied audience, from
        Tribal elders to elementary students.</p>
    <p>Working with ISITE Design, we adopted their five step
      planning and development methodology. These steps included <strong>Discover,</strong> <strong>Define</strong>, <strong>Design</strong>, <strong>Develop</strong> and <strong>Deploy</strong>. </p>
    <p>The project was initiated by a series of discovery
      meetings on a broad range of topics.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Content meetings to collaborate on production
        of the content inventory and content requirements document</li>
      <li>Community member meetings to gain an appreciation
        for how tribal members felt their history should be presented on-line</li>
      <li>Technical meetings to review our existing databases
        and the process to migrate their contents to the research library and
        Flash piece</li>
      <li>Creative meetings to define the balance between
        needs of the Tribe and requests and questions from the Public, and providing
        quality, detailed information while respecting inherent sacred knowledge
        that may not be intended for public consumption. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>With the initial meetings behind us, it became apparent
      that we had a huge content challenge ahead of us. Sifting through records
      of hundreds of years of history involved reviewing countless binders of
      records and photographs. Many of these of course would need to be digitally
      scanned and migrated into our new database. Just organizing and finding
      the right records was a large undertaking involving several people. </p>
    <p>At the point when we felt we had the majority of available
      content identified, we re-engaged with our vendor to begin the process
      of creating a storyboard for the exhibit, from which we could build out
      the chapters and focus on the content and artifacts we wanted to include.</p>
    <p>We learned that the type of rich interactive site
      we were building required different ways of planning than you would use
      with even a standard Web site. Our vendor helped us develop a detailed
      information architecture which showed not only the hierarchy and structure
      of the Web site, but also the interactive design required to make this
      an engaging on-line experience and to take advantage of the latest technology.</p>
    <h1>Defining the On-line Blueprint</h1>
    <p>Once the information architecture was complete, we
      worked with our vendor to develop multiple creative directions on how the
      end user experience could come to life. The use of audio, video, static
      images and a language other than English were to be incorporated to tell
      the story, and lent themselves to the creative process. A non-lineal framework
      was also an important consideration. Different creative mark-ups and storyboards
      were designed and in due course selected according to what fit the need
      most thoroughly. While the creative direction was being reviewed, we worked
      on the more tactical details of the functional and technical requirements
      to support the visual representation of the end deliverables.</p>
    <p>It was important to our success to include our Information
      Technology (IT) team early in the discussions as a partner helping to review
      the functionality and blueprint and ensure we had a development plan that
      could deliver our collective vision. IT played a central role in configuring
      the servers, purchasing software and helping to ensure the server&rsquo;s
      bandwidth allocation and technical specifications were appropriate. Once
      the IT group confirmed our technical requirements could be supported within
      their environment, our vendor began producing the technical systems necessary
      to power the visual experience.</p>
    <h1>Developing the Rich Media Engine</h1>
    <p>The first of two core technical components for the
      project was a rich media content management engine allowing non-technical
      tribal members to add, edit and delete images, videos, audios, documents
      and descriptions to the flash piece. These assets would be displayed in
      the <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story </em>section
      of the site in a rich narrative.</p>
    <p>The second deliverable was the on-line Research Library
      which was required to communicate with the <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story</em> piece
      from an import/export perspective. </p>
    <p>The Flash application was developed in less than two
      months; however, as indicated in the challenges section below, it took
      a significant amount of time to gather and organize the content to populate
      it. Due to problems from inconsistent image numbers to corrupt or missing
      files, it took more than four months for staff to track down, organize,
      create, scan, optimize and load the assets from our content requirements
      document into the system. </p>
    <p>Once the <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story </em>experience
        was into testing, we focused on the Research Library. This application
        was completed from a technical perspective and integrated with our Past
        Perfect and Laserfiche database systems to populate with content while
        we focused on the content for <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story.</em></p>
    <p>Logging into the Research Library for the first time
      after the integration with Past Perfect was a shock. All of a sudden we
      had thousands of documents and artifacts in the pending status awaiting
      our review and approval for public display. To approve a document, image,
      or artifact for publication we needed to follow several time-consuming
      steps which included copyright review, donor file review and verification,
      text examination for sensitive subjects, data editing for public consumption,
      and a minimum of 2 layers of internal review, each requiring a different
      staff member. Given the time commitment required to fulfill our internal
      needs of security, sensitivity, and quality control in the form of a unified
      Tribal voice, the task proved too daunting for immediate action. Hence
      the decision was made to limit the first release of public content in the
      Research Library to already approved content in <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our
      Story.</em></p>
    <p>Once content was completed in <em>Ntsayka Ikanum:
        Our Story, </em>we populated the multi-lingual
        note for navigational elements with language translations allowing visitors
        to browse in Chinuk Wawa, our officially recognized Tribal language of
        the reservation. Once XML feed for translation was imported, the project
        went through two rounds of ISITE Design testing and two rounds of CTGR
        testing where many small issues around content, functionality and user
        experience items were resolved. This bi-lingual component was essential
        in that serving the Tribal community was a top priority, so the perpetuation
        of our language via the Internet will serve as a component that can be
        integrated into the Chinuk Wawa classes, and vise versa. </p>
    <p>A pre-release of <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story </em>to
        a limited number of Internal staff and Tribal members and the Tribal
        Council, our governing body, was essential in order to educate Tribal
        government about the details. The official launch was delivered at our
        annual Contest Pow Wow in August, 2006. This allowed for layers of editing,
        analysis and internal review by a significant number of people prior
        to the announced launch date. </p>
    <p>The beauty of the system is that all content entered
      into the Research Library can be done completely internally by departmental
      staff who have limited training with technical applications. The Research
      Library will be an ever-growing asset.</p>
    <p>This 21<sup>st</sup> century means of exhibition and
      transmittal of critical information via the Internet serves well the needs
      of our Tribal community. The opportunity to interpret, design, and create
      an interactive learning tool that protects the objects themselves while
      making them publicly accessible, highlighting critical points in Grand
      Ronde history and incorporating the teachings of our Elders in their own
      words, is priceless. Once again the Tribes can be the ones to determine
      the destiny of our words, history, and even artifacts. As written by James
      Pepper Henry of the National Museum of the American Indian (2004), the &ldquo;stewardship&rdquo; approach
      to collections management translates into the notion that the physical
      preservation of an object is not synonymous with the preservation of its
      cultural integrity. On-line exhibition not only allows Tribal identity
      to shine through using modern means, but also allows us to determine the
      appropriateness of collections care in the physical sense while incorporating
      traditional sensitivities. </p>

    <h1>Challenges</h1>
    <p>This was the first major Internet initiative for the
      Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. The Tribes realized their planned physical
      museum would primarily serve Tribal Members and visitors living in the
      Pacific Northwest. Over the last 50 years Tribal Members have spread out
      to the point that almost 50% of tribal members are located outside the
      State of Oregon. The immediate need of providing a resource that was available
      to all Tribal members regardless of physical location and was also a way
      to connect with interested outside communities spurred the idea of an on-line
      project.</p>
    <p>Our project started broad with a large number of target
      audiences and feature ideas brainstormed from visiting many inspirational
      reference sites. Potential target audiences included members, educators,
      tourists, neighbors, government officials and other tribes. In an age where
      accessibility and innovation are key elements of the Web, on-line projects
      such as <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story </em>are
      helping to lead the way in this realm. A leading example is the National
      Museum of the American Indian, that has been working with Native communities
      in the Americas, highlighting traditional concepts such as story-telling
      and seasonal rounds by engaging local communities and facilitating a means
      of sharing their stories via the Internet. Interactive media is incorporated
      and allows the visitor to experience Elders speaking their original languages,
      telling their own stories. Providing a glimpse into not only this history
      of Tribes, but also current activities and endeavors that we are undertaking
      is useful for the casual visitor along with government agencies with whom
      Tribes actively work on a regular basis. The federal agencies which are
      charged with government to government consultation are provided with an
      additional window of opportunity to learn about those with whom they are
      consulting. This perspective is an added bonus when the primary accomplishment
      is to provide the Grand Ronde community with an outlet for information
      exchange. </p>
    <p>As we began to engage with our development partner,
      the enormity of the task at hand became clear. The project posed a challenge
      opposite to what one would traditionally find in the corporate world&hellip;..the
      sheer volume of content in a multitude of formats, databases and locations.
      The two primary project objectives were to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a visually engaging interactive piece,
        stepping a visitor through <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story.</em> </li>
      <li>Engineer an on-line research library integrated
        with <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Stor,y </em>where
        visitors have the opportunity to search in-depth or browse artifacts, photos
        and audio/video from the CTGR archives. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Taxonomies, content requirement documents, functional
      specifications, and metadata tagging are all considerations that require
      an enormous and unexpected absorption of time. </p>
    <h1><em>Ntsayka Ikanum</em>: Our Story</h1>
    <h3>Quality over Quantity</h3>
    <p>Grand Ronde like many institutions has in place multiple
      collection management systems capable of directing a browser to tens of
      thousands of resources. On the surface the volume of content seemed to
      be a blessing. We could story board out nearly any point in Grand Ronde&rsquo;s
      history and have a wide range of objects and assets to access. However,
      with the grant requirements, budget restraints, and daily workload outside
      of this project, limiting the concepts for <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story </em>was
      an important challenge. This was our first significant opportunity to share
      the wealth of knowledge possessed by CTGR for Tribal and public benefit,
      and to put restraints on it proved difficult. However, the dual components
      of the site design allows for us to make up the difference. What was not
      included in <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story </em>will
      potentially be incorporated into the Research Library. </p>
    <p>One key lesson learned from the content review process
      is to track copyright permission up front in the database, as a significant
      amount of time was spent going back and tracking down permission from the
      original copyright holders to place the object for view on the site. Copyright
      holders were typically agreeable to sharing their resources for the project,
      however wanted assurances as to the measures we would take to protect their
      imagery from download and on-line reposting in a way they could not control.
      The decision was made to use Adobe Flash as the display mechanism as it
      reduces the ease with which a visitor to the database can download the
      artifact and post on another page. We decided not to invest in a digital
      rights management solution or watermarking system because permission was
      requested from the various institutions holding copyright, particularly
      on images. Adobe Flash reduces the risk of a visitor downloading text and
      images, while the Research Library will provide the detailed information,
      including institutional details and copyrights. </p>
    <p>In addition to copyright permissions, we needed to
      be sensitive to individual privacy concerns. From historical medical records
      to legal affidavits, each item needed to be reviewed with consideration
      of how global publishing might affect those connected with the information.
      The pervasive sentiment of the time when many of these historic documents
      were created is one consideration not to be forgotten. For example, in
      1884, the Secretary of the Interior published &ldquo;Regulations of the
      Indian Office&rdquo; which banned all traditional religious activities,
      ceremonies, dancing, and mandated Christian only/English education of Indian
      children. Violators were imprisoned, starved, beaten, and items of personal,
      spiritual and cultural importance stolen as punishment. Given this federal
      mandate, it is not surprising that many Indian Agents of the time were
      influenced in their report writings by these kinds of laws. In sum, many
      of the historical resources available today reflect ideas that were dominant
      in White society of the time, yet Tribal communities know better and are
      able to enlighten the public about these kinds of prejudices that may not
      be obvious to the average citizen. </p>
    <h3>How Can We Afford To Feed This In-Depth Flash Experience?</h3>
    <p>The <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story </em>project
        is an always evolving site that CTGR plans to continually update with
        new photos, videos, audio files and maps. The budget for the project
        allowed for the construction of the site but was not sufficient to outsource
        the site updates to our vendor. To solve this problem, ISITE Design developed
        an Adobe Flash engine that allows us to simply edit an XML file for the
        descriptive text, place the asset in the correct chapter folder, and
        voila! The Flash transitions and display elements (play, rewind, zoom
        etc.) are applied, depending on the type of asset. By clearly articulating
        this requirement upfront, we were able to identify a solution that allowed
        our non-technical team to begin editing and adding documents to the Flash
        piece after a two-hour training session.</p>
    <h3>How do we transition visitors from the structured <em>Ntsayka Ikanum:
        Our Story </em>to the free form research
        library to browse the majority of our collection? </h3>
    <p>You may have heard of Web services and content feeds.
      This is a perfect example of the tremendous value on-line museums can gain
      by establishing these feeds. As a browser navigates the Flash piece, related
      content artifacts will be highlighted in the <strong>Learn More</strong> section
      of <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story. </em>The hope is to arouse visitors&rsquo; curiosity
      on topics in the Flash piece and induce them to jump over to the research
      library for in-depth access to the other 99% of artifacts that did not
      make the cut for the Flash component. Flexibility of movement between the
      two components was an important consideration. </p>
    <h3>Which stories should the Flash piece tell, and how do we achieve balance
      between <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story </em>and
      the Research Library?</h3>
    <p>Attempting to tell the story of the Confederated Tribes
      of Grand Ronde in an accurate, concise, interesting and intelligible way
      was a great challenge. The sheer volume of content provided great opportunity,
      but also required limitations. Incorporating the various media was also
      an important consideration. Oral histories and traditions are and have
      always been the means of sharing information within the Tribal community.
      Song, dance, and family recollections as well needed to be shared, as these
      are the true expressions of the people. Therefore audio, video, and interactive
      panels would provide the format for the Flash piece as they involve the
      viewer as well as express the tribal voice. </p>
    <p>Another consideration was the
      format for getting across the information. Linear methods do not reflect
      native thought processes, so we worked to tell the story in a fluid fashion
      while allowing each chapter to be independent and stand alone, as part
      of the circular story. Each chapter represents different time periods so
      that users can investigate what interests them most. Taken as a whole,
      the Flash piece speaks to Tribal history from the Myth Age all the way
      to today&rsquo;s community in a way that includes first person voice, images,
      and text. The Research Library is intended to provide primary source material
      in its original format as well as the entire content of the Flash component
      to &ndash; everything that could not fit <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story.</em></p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="trolan.fig6-a.jpg" alt="Fig 6: Home page of Research Library " width="400" height="270" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 6: Home page of Research Library </p>
    <h1>Research Library Specific Challenges</h1>
    <p>A consistent taxonomy across our multiple collection
      management systems was lacking going into the project, so all of that had
      to be communally brainstormed and applied across the board to every piece
      of material intended for the Research Library. The cross-referencing of
      these taxonomies to link related subjects, photos, records, and oral histories
      is a monumental task that will continue for years to come, particularly
      as the Research Library continues to grow. </p>
    <p>Over the last decade the Grand Ronde collection management
      systems logged many artifacts with inconsistent descriptive records. As
      CTGR opens the database up to on-line access, there is a significant data
      improvement process underway to ensure the search experience works well
      for end users. Search results will only be as accurate as the quality of
      the records in the database. To that end, the decision was made to launch
      the two components at different times in order to provide a resource for
      reference as soon as possible, while still achieving the goal of top-notch
      quality. </p>
    <h1>Promising Directions</h1>
    <p>One significant goal is to amplify the role that our
      interactive technology plays in the classroom, providing additional tools
      and lesson plans for teachers to increase the prevalence of Native American
      history and culture in their lesson plans. Resources available both on
      the Flash component as well as in the Research Library will be forthcoming,
      particularly in terms of the promulgation of our Chinuk Wawa language.
      Curriculum developed for both the adult language classes now taught in
      Grand Ronde, Portland, and Eugene, as well as our pre-school and kindergarten
      immersion school may be available in the near future. </p>
    <p>The research library contains a rich Web 2.0 component
      allowing tribal members to share, collaborate and interact with the artifacts
      previously housed in our archives. Whether in the form of corrections,
      identification, or general conversation, most items in our collection could
      benefit from additional input by the site visitor. We established a user
      commentary feature at the artifact level in the Research Library, allowing
      a site visitor to comment on an item and send that comment to our staff
      or request to have it posted as part of a moderated discussion around the
      specific object. This facet will be an indispensable asset, as the knowledge
      in the community now has a way to be facilitated and incorporated into
      the official record. Again, there is a multi-layered internal review process
      so that information can be checked, verified, and approved prior to public
      posting. This kind of access and multi-directional interaction will hopefully
      lead to reducing the geographical distances separating many of our tribal
      communities while improving the quality of our record specific descriptions
      and overall site content.</p>
    <p>As a part of the aforementioned ANA SEDS grant, a
      separate project proposal with related outcomes concerned the initial planning
      phase of the physical Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Museum and Cultural
      Center. Work commenced on this vital project at the same time. The result
      of the grant gave us a Museum Master plan that incorporated site analysis
      and selection, community meetings with Tribal members&rsquo; input, and
      an initial design concept for the physical structure. The beauty of doing
      these projects simultaneously is that the support generated from within
      the community was reflected in both project results. The on-line museum
      development not only provides Grand Ronde with a basis for story line development
      in the physical museum, but also gives us a vital tool to encourage support
      and funding for this long-desired cultural center. </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="trolan.fig7-a.jpg" alt="Fig 7: Museum planning site analysis diagram. " width="400" height="300" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 7: Museum planning site analysis diagram. </p>
    <p>The on-line components of our project will hopefully
      attract visitors from throughout the world to visit our physical museum.
      Our Web applications currently support the generation of RSS feeds from
      our data and image repositories which could be consumed by portals such
      as France&rsquo;s NetVibes, helping to spread awareness and generate more
      interest in the Grand Ronde history and traditions to a broader audience.
      The concern at this time is copyright protection as most portals do not
      have built-in digital rights management for image streams. Video and text
      documents can be consumed with a much lower degree of copyright concern</p>
    <h1>Outcomes</h1>
    <p>From an empirical perspective, since the launch visitors
      spend an average of more than 20 minutes browsing our on-line experience.
      This is compared to an average of 2 minutes per Web site. Additionally,
      since the launch of <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story,</em> the
      volume of visitors to our site has doubled. This statistic in itself tends
      to the belief that the site is accomplishing the goals originally set out:
      providing access with security, providing a single source for Grand Ronde
      information, and most importantly, speaking with a Tribal voice, telling
      our own story in an innovative and interesting way. The potential audience
      for the Virtual Gallery is far from realized. </p>
    <p>Even more rewarding for us, though, is watching visitors
      interact with <em>Ntsayka Ikanum: Our Story,</em> for
      the first time. We chose to launch the on-line experience at our 2006 Contest
      Pow-Wow. This is an annual Tribal celebration that brings together Tribal
      members and Elders from near and far, community members, and interested
      visitors either to participate in the dancing and drumming competitions,
      or to observe and enjoy the skills and talents displayed by the participants.
      While Pow Wow&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t customary in our area, it has become
      a 20<sup>th</sup> century tradition that brings the Grand Ronde community
      together, often for family reunions organized around the same time. Because
      many folks come home for this event, we hoped to reach a wide audience
      for the launch, and so sent out invitations to all Tribal households inviting
      them to attend the launch party. As part of this, we opened our computer
      lab with all browsers defaulted to the on-line experience. The feedback
      was incredible.</p>

    <p>Tears came to the eyes of a tribal member from the
      Midwest experiencing video of tribal elders who have passed on. Meanwhile
      young tribal members were watching a video of their great grandmother whom
      they never knew. One Tribal member called to say that she had never seen
      the photo of her father on the baseball team, and that receiving the postcard
      invitation with the screen shot of the landing page was the highlight of
      her week. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Grand Ronde Tribes&rsquo; virtual museum,
      titled &ldquo;Ntsayka Ikanum-Our Story.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a huge amount
      of material there, so sit down with a cup of coffee and browse. A lot of
      you have wanted to find more Jargon learning materials and now you&rsquo;ve
      got them. Here are some other comments in people&rsquo;s own words. A linguist,
      student of Chinuk Wawa and PhD candidate at the University of Victoria
      wrote, </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">At this Web site there&rsquo;s video and audio of a
      pronunciation key, elders speaking Chinook, an audio essay on the origin
      of Jargon (in Chinuk, the immersion preschool kids talking), and more.
      And that&rsquo;s just when you click the &ldquo;Wawa&rdquo; button. You
      just click a button to read it in the language you want. The other buttons
      lead you to extensive material about traditional culture, origins of the
      reservation, the elders, reservation history, and the contemporary community.
      The tribes have done a fantastic job with the virtual museum. You could
      easily spend a couple of hours browsing through it. You&rsquo;ll find nice
      features throughout. </p>
    <p>One of the Tribal teachers commented, &ldquo;Wow,
      the site is amazing! I am able to show Wilson Bobb, one of my students,
      his namesake [and great-grandfather] speaking Chinuk!&rdquo; Another visitor
      wrote, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Grand Ronde Tribal member, but as a Native
      person I think it is so important to have Native history available. It&rsquo;s
      so awesome that Tribal members worldwide will be able to feel a connection
      to the history of their people. Awesome job!&rdquo; And a final thought
      by a Tribal member, &ldquo;It is very nice seeing my family and relatives,
      a lot of whom I never met or knew due to termination policies enforced
      on our family. I hope we get our Museum soon.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>These are the sorts of invaluable cultural interactions
      that we hoped would come to fruition. We have begun to harness the power
      of the Web in preserving and disseminating our culture in a sensitive and
      accurate way. We see many exciting opportunities to increase the impact
      of our interactive work both within our community and the world.</p>
