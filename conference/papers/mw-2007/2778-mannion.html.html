				  <p class="abstractText">Cultural
				      heritage multimedia is a young domain which lacks certain elements
				      of mature fields, including degree-granting educational programs. Despite
				      the absence of established paradigms, a number of academic institutions
				      are developing programs in this area. At this critical juncture, when
				      skills and processes are being codified for the first time in academic
				      curricula, the input of professional practitioners is desperately needed.
				      This paper and accompanying forum are an open invitation to the museum
				      multimedia community to contribute their insights. Key issues will
				      be discussed in the context of a conceptual model and concrete examples.
				      The model is based on three years of student feedback at the University
				      of Lugano. It addresses three questions:</p>
				  <ul class="abstractText">
				    <li>What should students
				      know?</li>
				    <li>How should they learn
				      it?</li>
				    <li>Who should teach it?			          </li>
			    </ul>
				  <p class="abstractText">Meaningful dialogue between the academic and professional
				    communities is the only way to bridge the gap between theoretical and
				    applied knowledge. This is especially true in a multidisciplinary field
				    like cultural heritage multimedia where there is no consensus about the
				    ideal path to professional qualification. Museum professionals, your
				    future colleagues need your help. How can educators ensure that graduates
				    will be able to operate creatively and effectively in the professional

				  <h1>Introduction</h1>
				  <p>This paper introduces a new model for teaching cultural
				    heritage multimedia and invites feedback from museum professionals
				    about its merits. First, a framework (Figure 1) for course
				    content is discussed. It consists of three categories: Interpretation
				    and Communication Skills, Design and Production Skills, and
				    Creative Project-making Skills.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="mannion-figure1.gif" alt="Fig 1: Model for teaching cultural heritage multimedia based on student feedback from Master in Technology-Enhanced Communication for Cultural Heritage" width="400" height="300" /></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 1:
				      Model for teaching cultural heritage multimedia based on student feedback
				      from Master in Technology-Enhanced Communication for Cultural Heritage
				      (<a href="../http://www.tec-ch.unisi.ch/" target="_blank">http://www.tec-ch.unisi.ch</a>)</p>
				  <p>These categories correspond to the three types of
				    competencies that most educators view as essential elements
				    in a successful learning environment: knowledge, skills, and attitudes.
				    The second part of this paper describes effective instruction and course
				    formats. Third, we examine a student-developed on-line course that includes
				    some of these elements. These suggestions are based on three years of
				    student work in the Masters program for cultural heritage communication
				    (<a href="../http://www.tec-ch.unisi.ch/" target="_blank">http://www.tec-ch.unisi.ch</a>)
				    at the University of Lugano. The intent in presenting this
				    model is to encourage the current generation of museum professionals
				    to take an active role in shaping newly emerging educational programs
				    in this field. </p>
				  <h1>Interpretation and Communication
				      Skills</h1>
				  <p>Interpretation is the single-most important competency
				    that educational programs in cultural heritage multimedia should provide.
				    Interpretation includes a number of aspects. First, the ability to &ldquo;get
				    to the bottom of things&rdquo; or uncover underlying themes and ideas
				    which are central to the subject or artwork. Second, the ability to discern
				    which themes or ideas are interesting for the target audience. Students
				    must also be able to weave these concepts into a compelling and dramatic
				    narrative. In fact, award-winning museum Web site developers say that
				    their &ldquo;approach to the content, their understanding of the need
				    for narrative, set them apart from those who design non-educational sites&rdquo; (Haley
				    Goldman, Haley Goldman, 2005). Third, students need the ability to decode
				    the language of curators and domain experts and engage them in intelligent
				    dialogue about the material and its communicative potential. This final
				    point requires that students be exposed to the theoretical approaches
				    used in different disciplines. This gives them flexibility to operate
				    in a variety of cultural domains. While the level of their domain expertise
				    may never equal that of curators, they need to delve deeply into content
				    in order to understand and appreciate its characteristics. Only then
				    can they make good judgments about how to adapt it appropriately and
				    creatively.</p>
				  <p>Strong interpretive skills are indispensable whether
				    students pursue careers as independent consultants or as museum professionals.
				    Consultants who work for many different types of institutions need to
				    understand a variety of approaches to culture. This generalist knowledge
				    allows them to speak the language of their clients. Those students who
				    become museum professionals will be able to bring fresh perspectives
				    from outside the discipline to invigorate the communicative approaches
				    being used within their institution. Since Web-based multimedia applications
				    are not bound by the physical walls of a museum, a variety of approaches
				    ensures that they will reach diverse audiences. Experience in student
				    projects confirms that designers who immerse themselves in the subject
				    matter are able to discover creative solutions. The opening screen of
				    a multimedia kiosk (Figure 2) for the Museum of Extra European Culture
				    in Lugano depicts tribal members gathered around a fire. Ancestral figures
				    from the collection look on from behind. The project is exemplary in
				    part because of its elegant graphic design, but even more because students
				    captured a fundamental theme in Oceanic life &ndash; the ever-present connection
				    with deceased ancestors &ndash; and embedded it in a compelling narrative.</p>

				  <p class="caption">Fig 2:
				      Design of an interactive kiosk for the Museum of Extra European Cultures
				      in Lugano by students Jessica Powers, Paola Lazzeri and Mehdi Abdollah.
				      The application also included evocative sound effects of blazing fire
				      and traditional drumming.</p>
				  <p>Internship experiences also reveal the importance
				    of interpretive skills. As one student reports: &ldquo;What I really
				    need are tools to interpret the content. I was supposed to write exhibit
				    labels, but how can write them if I don&rsquo;t know anything about the
				    objects or how to analyze them?&rdquo; Clearly, students need more than
				    communication theory alone: more than simplistic guidelines on the appropriate
				    length and style of texts, more than Flash animation labs. They need
				    to understand &ndash; at least to some degree &ndash; how to carry out an interpretative
				    analysis of the subject they are communicating. Interpretive skill is <em>the</em> quality
				    which distinguishes practitioners of cultural heritage communication
				    from those in other fields. As one museum Web site developer told Michael
				    and Kathryn Haley Goldman (2005): &ldquo;When we hire someone new, we
				    have to make it clear that this [is] very different from marketing or
				    [working at] an advertising firm. The skill of interpretation needed
				    [in an employee] is hard to find.&rdquo;</p>
				  <h1>Design and Production
				      Skills</h1>
				  <p>Technology training is an essential part of any
				    program in cultural heritage multimedia. Students should be exposed to
				    cutting-edge software applications used in the professional world. Ideally,
				    this training should be done in the context of project-oriented assignments
				    where students work with actual content from museums or other cultural
				    institutions. This ensures that interpretation becomes an integral part
				    of the development process. If students work in groups, a rotation system
				    should be employed so individuals are required to perform different roles.
				    Evaluation should include both an assessment of the collective product
				    and the contributions of individuals. At the University of Lugano, instructor
				    Peter Samis (who teaches the introductory course Interactive Communication
				    for Museums) requires students to submit a short individual report describing
				    the process and group dynamic from a personal point of view. This tends
				    to expose personality conflicts or differences in working styles and
				    makes the process of evaluation much easier.</p>
				  <p>In addition to hands-on production skills, students
				    must be aware of emerging technologies and the social trends which influence
				    them. Instructor Susan Chun (who teaches a seminar on Cataloguing by
				    Crowd) observed that, even after a full semester of coursework, students
				    in the Swiss program knew very little about Web 2.0, or social tagging,
				    or similar technologies widely discussed in the professional community.
				    Although they had been introduced to Web sites like Flickr (<a href="../http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com</a>)
				    and YouTube (<a href="../http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com</a>),
				    they could not articulate what distinguished them from more traditional-style
				    Web applications. To encourage students to develop a habit of keeping
				    up with current trends, Chun suggests an ongoing &ldquo;show-and-tell&rdquo; of
				    innovative Web sites. Students are to research at least one application
				    a week and present it to their colleagues. An equal number of examples
				    must be taken from inside and outside the cultural realm. Students should
				    also be encouraged to incorporate technology into their every day lives
				    and experiment with new kinds of electronic devices. Educational institutions
				    must make these devices available on loan for those who cannot afford
				    them.</p>
				  <p>The type of training described above is clearly
				    important, but it is nothing new. Many institutions offer generic multimedia
				    production programs, and there are well-established methods of teaching
				    the subject. There is another aspect to production skills, however, which
				    is critical for cultural heritage applications. Students must learn to
				    make the connection between the audience for cultural products &ndash; users
				    and visitors &ndash; and their designs. Visitor perception is identified by
				    professional practitioners as a crucial but little understood element
				    in successful museum Web sites. It emerges as a central theme in Michael
				    and Kathryn Haley Goldmans&rsquo; (2005) survey:</p>
				  <p class="BlockQuote">By
				      acknowledging two types of judges for success &ndash; experts and visitors,
				      we face one of the most critical issues in museum Web site design today &ndash; the
				      lack of rigorous evidence from the visitors about their opinions (10). &hellip; [T]he
				      practitioners clearly agreed that the user is a central figure in successful
				      museum Web sites (10). &hellip; Many of those interviewed
				      saw this aspect of the user or visitor as one of the larger challenges
				      for museum Web sites at this time (11).</p>
				  <p>The authors conclude that &ldquo;the lack of true
				    connection with the virtual user has handicapped the evolution
				    of both the domain and the field&rdquo;. Clearly, this is an area
				    where educational programs can lead the way.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="mannion-figure3.jpg" alt="Fig 3: Students at the University of Lugano act as test administrators and subjects in a course on Web site usability testing. " width="400" height="308" /></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 3:
				      Students at the University of Lugano act as test administrators and
				      subjects in a course on Web site usability testing. </p>
				  <p>Usability testing alone is not enough, however.
				    Students need a toolkit of techniques for collecting and interpreting
				    user data</p>
				  <p>In his introductory course, Peter Samis introduces
				    the Visitor Bill of Rights (Rand, 1995), and students work with personae
				    and scenarios (Smith, 2003). Later in the semester, students also participate
				    in a usability lab. But these activities alone are less than sufficient.
				    They should be followed up with an entire course dedicated to understanding
				    user/visitor requirements on-line and off-line. Such a course could provide
				    a toolkit of techniques and methodologies for collecting, analyzing and
				    interpreting user feedback. Assignments would stress the link between
				    data analysis and appropriate design. Ideally, an iterative method would
				    be used where early stage designs are evaluated and modified based on
				    user feedback. This user-centered approach should be a continuous thread
				    throughout the entire curriculum: the user should be the central figure
				    in every design discussion. Graduates should emerge as pro-active user
				    advocates who know how to translate both structured (quantitative) and
				    unstructured (qualitative) feedback into concrete design solutions.</p>
				  <h1>Creative Project-making
				      Skills</h1>
				  <p>Students should be encouraged to formulate personal
				    visions of what they want to accomplish in their careers. This vision
				    must be grounded in an understanding of the type of organizational, political
				    and economic obstacles they are likely to encounter in the workplace.
				    Without this knowledge, students experience serious conflicts when they
				    attempt to apply their expertise in professional situations and can easily
				    become discouraged. One student who spent three months at a large museum
				    in Berlin relates her experience: </p>
				  <p class="BlockQuote">I was
				      shocked. They had barely heard of multimedia, much less think of it
				      as relevant to their exhibition work. All these things we learn in
				      this program are wonderful and exciting, but what am I supposed to
				      do if they have never even heard of these things?</p>
				  <p>Students need to be taught how to cope with such
				    situations, because success in their careers depends on their ability
				    to act as effective change-agents. They must help their colleagues understand
				    how multimedia can support the institution&rsquo;s mission and educational
				    goals, and enable it to reach out to new types of visitors. Many cultural
				    institutions, especially those outside North America, have little or
				    no experience with new technologies, and students frequently encounter
				    resistance or even outright hostility to their proposals and suggestions.
				    These are organizations and people in transition and students must develop
				    the sensitivity to guide uncertain, even recalcitrant, colleagues through
				    this delicate process. As Peter Samis (2006) points out:</p>
				  <p class="BlockQuote">As
				      museums come to consciousness that the old models, the old paradigms,
				      are not going to serve them well enough in the coming decades, the
				      coming years, the coming century, [cultural heritage multimedia] graduates
				      can become the pioneers in helping museums communicate with their publics
				      using the tools like the Web, podcasting and DVDs. [Tools] that museums
				      themselves are only beginning to understand.</p>
				  <p>Coping effectively involves a variety of competencies
				    that could be summarized as Creative Project-making: out-of-the-box thinking,
				    an understanding of technology adoption, change management, conflict
				    resolution, effective proposal and presentation skills, fundraising,
				    and project management. The discussion of how to negotiate these situations
				    must be an ongoing part of the curriculum so that by the time students
				    start their internships they are prepared for the challenges they may
				    face. In his three-day seminar, visiting professor Larry Friedlander
				    tirelessly encouraged students to consider the impact of organizational
				    realities on their designs. Each afternoon he assigned design problems
				    in different types of cultural institutions. These included museums,
				    libraries, schools and government ministries. Students had less than
				    three hours to brainstorm, research, and flesh out their solutions. Then,
				    in presentations to the class, they were required to justify their rationale
				    &ndash; why their proposed design was appropriate for the given institution.
				    These exercises stimulated creativity, but at the same time compelled
				    students to be realistic about the feasibility of their &ldquo;big ideas&rdquo;. </p>
				  <h1>Instructors and Course
				      Format</h1>
				  <p>Instructors with professional experience are essential,
				    because they are able to ground discussions in real-world examples. Professional
				    experience alone is not enough, however. These individuals must also
				    be lateral thinkers, able to connect multiple disciplines seamlessly.
				    Museum multimedia is a domain that merges concepts and skills &ndash; art and
				    technology &ndash; that many people perceive as contradictory. Students are
				    excited by the potential collision of these &ldquo;opposite worlds&rdquo; and
				    are attracted to educational programs that claim to reconcile them. As
				    one student remarked: &ldquo;To me that [multidisciplinary quality] is
				    interesting. It&rsquo;s like redefining new fields.&rdquo; Students need
				    instructors who embody the kind of synthesis that they too hope to master.
				    Those who stick narrowly to a single domain or who are incapable of making
				    imaginative links and connections are perceived as irrelevant by students,
				    regardless of how competent they may be within their area of expertise.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="mannion-figure4.jpg" alt="Fig 4: Students in Interactive Communication for Museums during a field trip to the Hermann Hesse Museum in Montagnola." width="400" height="292" /></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 4:
				      Students in Interactive Communication for Museums during a field trip
				      to the Hermann Hesse Museum in Montagnola. Seated (right) are instructor
				      Peter Samis and museum director Regina B&uuml;cher</p>
				  <p>Courses themselves should include two elements:
				    a connection or collaboration with a real-world cultural institution
				    or artist, and ample time to explore cultural subjects through open discussion.
				    Entering the world of a museum or atelier &ndash; even for half a day &ndash; confronts
				    students with many of the sticky problems professional practitioners
				    encounter. If these collaborations include a tour or formal interview,
				    students have the chance to see or even participate in the life cycle
				    of multimedia production as camera persons, sound engineers or interviewers.
				    Students in Interactive Communication for Museums have interviewed architect
				    Mario Botta at his office; met with Regina B&uuml;cher, director of the
				    Hermann Hesse Museum in Montagnola; and toured the Museum of Extra European
				    Culture. Ideally, these activities are followed by a lengthy debriefing
				    session during which instructors help students make sense of their experience
				    and uncover important interpretive themes that become raw material for
				    interactive designs. After a field trip to an ethnographic museum, visiting
				    professor Harald Kraemer posed the following thought experiment: If your
				    visit was a meal, what kind of food would it be? This evoked a wide range
				    of responses: Spanish Tapas, Nouveau cuisine, Chinese buffet, Indonesian
				    rice table. These strange, but stimulating, descriptions became the inspiration
				    for students&rsquo; multimedia projects.</p>
				  <h1>Communication Strategies
				      for Cultural Heritage</h1>
				  <p>Communication Strategies for Cultural Heritage (CSfCH)
				    is an on-line course that incorporates some of the elements discussed
				    above. Created as a student project for the Moodle (<a href="../http://moodle.org/" target="_blank">http://moodle.org</a>)
				    platform, it synthesizes several months of course material into a simple
				    framework for teaching cultural heritage multimedia to beginners. Four
				    cultural domains are studied as separate modules: Museums, Archaeology,
				    Performing Arts, and Cultural Tourism. The table below (Table 1) shows
				    the content of the Museums module within the four-part framework: Key
				    challenges, Strategies, Techniques and Technologies.</p>

				      Content of the Museums module in Communication Strategies
			      for Cultural Heritage</p>
				  <p>Each of the four modules focuses on three important
				    interpretive issues in the given domain. These are formulated as &ldquo;Key
				    Challenges.&rdquo; The Museums module, for example, examines the challenges
				    of fostering aesthetic appreciation, the public perception of museums
				    as elite institutions, and the tension between preservation and public
				    access to artworks. Obviously, this is not a comprehensive list. The
				    aim is not be to exhaustive, but to get students thinking about how the
				    unique characteristics of a domain influence the design of interactive
				    applications. </p>

				  <p>The design template is a default used by the University
				    of Lugano for its Moodle on-line course platform. The course has four
				    modules: Museums, Archaeology, Performing Arts and Cultural Tourism</p>
				  <p>The second part of the CSfCH framework is a list
				    of effective strategies for cultural heritage communication (Table 2).
				    A strategy from the list is matched with each of the key challenges to
				    form a problem/solution pair. On one hand, the list serves as a set of
				    fundamental quality principles for cultural heritage multimedia. Sources
				    of inspiration include Tate Modern&rsquo;s Principles of Interpretation
				    (Wilson, 2004), Ten Quality Principles for Cultural Heritage Websites
				    from the Minerva Project (<a href="../http://www.minervaeurope.org/" target="_blank">http://www.minervaeurope.org</a>),
				    and the American Association of Museums MUSE Award Criteria (<a href="../http://www.mediaandtechnology.org/" target="_blank">http://www.mediaandtechnology.org</a>).
				    In addition, it is an objective criterion against which applications
				    being considered as case studies could be evaluated. Together, Key Challenges
				    and Strategies correspond to Interpretation and Communication in the
				    model introduced at the beginning of this paper.</p>

				  <p>Design and Productions Skills, the second element
				    of the overarching model, are taught through case studies of successful
				    Web-based multimedia applications. Case studies show the Strategies (or
				    solutions to Key Challenges) in action. More than a hundred applications
				    were considered during the selection process, including many Best of
				    the Web winners. The case studies illustrate the third and fourth parts
				    of the CSfCH framework: Techniques and Technologies. Techniques were
				    reverse engineered from the applications seen during the selection of
				    the case studies. They are the basic building blocks of applications
				    divorced from the technologies used to implement them. Making a separation
				    between Techniques and Technologies forces students to think first about <em>what</em> their
				    design needs to accomplish, rather than <em>how</em> it
				    will be built. This emphasizes the needs of users over the lure of &ldquo;cool&rdquo; technologies.
				    It also helps students understand that while design techniques are relatively
				    constant, technologies are constantly evolving and changing. The technology
				    used to implement a virtual map today may not be the same as the one
				    used tomorrow. Technologies are simply the actual software or coding
				    methods used to create the specific element being discussed.</p>

				  <p>These rich-media vignettes walk students step-by-step
				    through the application. The audio commentary points out which techniques
				    and technologies are being used to solve an interpretive challenge</p>
				  <p>The final assignment for CSfCH is intended to develop
				    students&rsquo; Creative Project-making skills, the third element of
				    the model. After working through the four domain modules, students are
				    presented with a design challenge &ndash; the brief for a multimedia application
				    drawn from a real-life scenario. Although the primary goal is to describe
				    a prototype application based on the techniques they have learned, students
				    are also expected to take organizational and economic realities and limitations
				    into account. This encourages them to reflect on the appropriateness
				    of their ideas in the context of a specific institution.</p>
				  <p>Clearly, this project is a work in progress. An
				    on-line course cannot incorporate all the elements of an ideal curriculum
				    discussed in this paper. Upon completion of the course, however, students
				    should be acquainted with some of the most important interpretive problems
				    and the kinds of strategies and design elements they can use to solve
				    them. As they progress, students will go beyond the mechanical process
				    of matching Strategies with Key Challenges and Techniques with Technologies.
				    Ideally, they will reach a point where the framework has been internalized
				    and they are able to combine and recombine the basic elements on an intuitive
				    level &ndash; the same way that highly-skilled professional practitioners operate. </p>
				  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
				  <p>The domain of cultural heritage multimedia is entering
				    a delicate phase during which the skills and processes of professional
				    practitioners are being codified in academic curricula. At this critical
				    moment, the input of the professional community is essential to ensure
				    that educators are on the right track. This paper suggests that there
				    are three main competencies students need: Interpretation and Communication
				    Skills, Design and Production Skills, and Creative Project-making Skills.
				    It argues that instructors must have both professional experience and
				    the ability to make connections across multiple disciplines. Courses
				    should include collaborations with real-world cultural institutions that
				    promote dialogue between students and professionals about the challenges
				    of carrying out innovative multimedia projects. </p>
				  <p>The ideas presented here are simply starting points
				    for discussion. What makes sense about this model? What could be improved?
				    What other important questions should be raised? Dialogue with ideas
				    exchange between the academic and professional communities is the only
				    way to ensure that the next generation of museum professionals will be
				    able to make meaningful contributions to the evolution of this field. </p>
