    <h1>Introduction: Why a Digital Revolution?</h1>
    <p>Interactive multimedia and digital devices are pervasive in many American
      households. Multitasking cell phones and the ever-improving iPod are rapidly
      altering the way individuals receive and relay information. Digital media
      and the technologies associated with this emerging field are not only changing
      our personal behaviors but also&nbsp; transforming society itself. Nearly
      72% of the total population now owns a cellular phone (CTIA, 2006); every
      month YouTube.com has 20 million unique users (YouTube, Inc., 2007); and
      last year 12% of&nbsp; users downloaded podcasts (Madden, 2006). More rapidly
      than ever, digital technology and interactive multimedia are changing the
      way we learn, work, interact and entertain. </p>
    <p>Videos, audio broadcasts and interactive technologies are tools that museums
      can now use to engage and communicate with their audiences. From collections
      to marketing, education to administration, nearly all departments within
      a museum should view digital media as a means to better serve diverse audiences.
      Museums can cultivate new audiences (existing in both the cyber and physical
      environments) as well as encourage return visits. Technology also enhances
      museum gallery visits as the use of digital devices heightens the sensory
      connections a visitor makes with exhibitions and collections. </p>
    <p>One of the most exciting benefits of broadcasting new media content via
      the Web is the immersive experience available to audiences who may never
      step through a museum&rsquo;s&nbsp; front door. Digital media can widen
      the margins of communication by presenting richer content. Although it
      may be true that nothing can replace the first-hand experience of a museum
      visit, technology can help to make the Web experience analogous to reality.
      And, best of all, digital media can give even the smallest, most remote
      museum a global presence.</p>
    <p>While there is little doubt that digital media has the power to transform
      institutions, for many museum professionals, the practical use of these
      emerging technologies remains elusive. The new field of digital media is
      complex, fast-paced and often poorly defined. There are many barriers keeping
      museums (both large and small) from venturing to this exciting new frontier.
      For some, it&rsquo;s getting a handle on the basics: &ldquo;How do you
      create a podcast?&rdquo; For others, it&rsquo;s getting a handle on the
      budget: &ldquo;What happens if we sink all this money into a project and
      it&rsquo;s a dud?&rdquo; And maybe, for most of us, it&rsquo;s getting
      a handle on the boss: &ldquo;No, seriously, a viral video is actually a
      good thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; By the time you overcome these obstacles and have
      the budget and support to use new technology, you may be way behind the
      curve. So how can museum professionals overcome these barriers and help
      their museums stay up to speed? How can an advocate of technology affect
      institutional change?</p>
    <p>Before this paper addresses the &ldquo;digital revolution,&rdquo; there
      is a caveat. Technology is only a tool for communication; in the scenarios
      that we present: it is not a product unto itself. What and how we communicate
      should work in tandem to further the museum&rsquo;s mission and priorities.
      When using interactive multimedia and digital devices, museums should not
      diminish the significance of the content in favor of the novelty of the
      technology. </p>
    <h1>Part 1 - Your Very Own Digital Revolution</h1>
    <h2>Seeds of rebellion:&nbsp; create successful first projects that will kill
      the enemy Doubt. </h2>
    <p>Every project will fail or succeed.&nbsp; If your institution
      is new to technology, then it&rsquo;s important to begin with a project
      that has the highest likelihood of success. A first attempt that ends in
      catastrophe is likely to put an immediate end to your digital revolution,
      for much of your battle is in building the goodwill, trust, and support
      of others in your institution.&nbsp; Early victories are the keys to building
      and sustaining technological momentum. Regardless of its complexity or
      cost, any technology project you begin will need to be evaluated from a
      variety of perspectives.&nbsp; There are simple questions that first must
      be asked.&nbsp; For instance, do you have a particular collection area
      with a compelling story to tell?&nbsp; Has a collection area recently been
      digitized? Do you work with collection experts that are willing to experiment
      with a digital project? Is there an existing network of new media professionals
      you can access (such as a colleague, a local university or a production
      house)? Your answers to these questions may reveal smart options for content,
      organization and delivery. Content should drive the digital project. Identifying
      a rich collection area and its story is step one. </p>
    <p>Determining what digital devices and interactive media your visitors will
      support and appreciate is critical. The good news is that these answers
      are easy to find. Surveys are simple, cost-effective methods that will
      help you organize your project and select the right delivery mechanism.
      Conducted on-site or via your institutions&rsquo; Web site, surveys provide
      important information about which digital devices or applications visitors
      are most comfortable using. For example, prior to creating or deploying
      an audio tour, you should assess the percentage of your audience that owns
      or feels comfortable with the various distribution methods (cell phone,
      podcast, or on-site distributed mp3 player). Keep in mind that segmenting
      your audience can lead to different results; a contemporary art collection
      may have an audience more comfortable with podcasting than would a historic
      house museum. Great content and well-designed delivery tools alone won&rsquo;t
      guarantee success. Your audience must buy into the plan.</p>
    <p>After you&rsquo;ve chosen your content and assessed your audience, there
      are basic steps for ensuring success. First, determine a set of modest
      goals that align with your institution&rsquo;s priorities. As part of this
      process, evaluate and decide whether you will rely on quantitative or qualitative
      evidence of success. For example, do the number of people that use your
      device matter as much as the favorable impressions they report?&nbsp; Identify
      the methods you will use to collect and measure your data. Are surveys
      necessary? Is there a way to track use? Your ability to evaluate and communicate
      success will, in turn, enable you to apply for and receive funds, create
      cross-departmental consensus, and importantly, promote your digital revolution. </p>
    <h2>Circle Of Trust: Gathering Your Allies&nbsp; </h2>
    <p>Once you have identified your project and defined your metrics of success,
      it is time to build your team.&nbsp; As you begin, have conversations with
      people throughout the museum about your ideas and ambitions. Engage fellow
      staff members in discussions about technology and its potential. These
      conversations are effective in assessing the enthusiasm of your peers.
      To build the strongest basis for your project, your team should consist
      of colleagues with varied managerial levels, expertise, and experience.
      In assembling your internal digital team, you may discover you have an
      individual or a group of talented staff members experienced in using audio,
      video, image or animation software. In larger museums, other departments
      may even have software, cameras or lighting that could be utilized: IT,
      Exhibits, Education and Photography are always good sources for this. </p>
    <p>Create a strong foundation for your project by working with people who
      can effectively deliver creative content. Do not overlook the stewards
      of your collections. Establishing productive and meaningful working relationships
      with those closest to the stories will produce an environment ripe for
      your revolution and lead to a successful project. Any innovative project,
      no matter how great the foundation, can collapse without support. While
      expertise and creativity are important, time and again the ability to positively
      influence members of the highest level of the organization is the most
      crucial element of a project&rsquo;s success. A supporter of your project
      may not necessarily understand the technology or be an expert in the content
      covered, but he or she must understand the significance of the project
      and unreservedly support the endeavor. Whether it&rsquo;s the director
      of a department, the CEO, or the museum&rsquo;s board, at some point&nbsp; someone
      in&nbsp; authority may be leery of technology and question the validity
      of your project. When that time arrives, be sure to have a champion of
      your digital revolution who can serve as an advocate for innovation.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>No matter the size of the museum, it is often rare to have enough staff
      or time to commit to a new and potentially risky project. Innovation is
      rarely budgeted for in not-for-profit organizations.&nbsp; Historically,
      museums react to social or technological trends rather than anticipate
      them: the museum field may find itself significantly behind the corporate
      and academic world. To overcome the gap, find an outside partner that has
      a proven track record of success in the technology you plan to employ,
      and also has the resources to assist you with the project. </p>
    <p>For organizations with limited budgets, universities with tested and applicable
      research projects may be perfect partners. Collaborations with universities
      are mutually beneficial:&nbsp; the students and researchers provide the
      expertise, time, tools and data to assist in a project, and the museum
      provides content and the environment to prove the tangible benefits of
      academic research. An added benefit to these academic collaborations is
      that the social good produced by such a partnership creates a better case
      for budget allotments, corporate giving and foundation support for both
      parties.</p>
    <p>If a university collaboration is not attainable, there are options available
      in the corporate world. Digital media production has become a new and lucrative
      field for many businesses. As in Web design, museums can now hire companies
      (either local or national) to create interactive multimedia for countless
      uses and for digital devices. These partnerships can be expensive, but
      because you are paying for the work, the process is generally more straightforward
      and less time-consuming for you. While you may be doing less work, keep
      in mind that the content and direction of the project must reflect your
      museum&rsquo;s mission and institutional priorities. In the end, the product
      has to fit the identity of the museum, not that of the company that created
      it.&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>The Uprising: Self-Promotion Can Lead To Institutional Adoption. </h2>
    <p>Promote. Promote. Promote. It is important that once your project is successful,
      your colleagues know not only about your product, but also about your process.
      The publicity you create will demystify the use of technology in the museum
      context. Your peers will gain insight into the benefits of digital media
      and will begin to explore its limitless applications. Help those who are
      interested go deeper by directing them to on-line resources and materials
      through which they can become better informed.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>With your organization listening, take it public. Nothing is more effective
      than media attention to serve as validation for your revolution. After
      your initial success, spend some time with your museum&rsquo;s public relations
      team to explain what you have done and why it&rsquo;s significant. Write
      a fact sheet and present it to your communications staff. No project is
      too insignificant for public attention. Even if it is just a paragraph
      in your membership&rsquo;s newsletter, do all that you can to make your
      success known beyond the walls of your museum. Keep in mind that projects
      strategically deployed to the Web may do the talking for themselves.</p>
    <p>The buzz created will have people talking.&nbsp; The successes achieved
      in previous work will influence museum-wide perceptions of digital content.
      As the knowledge of your museum staff grows, so, too, will individuals&rsquo; ability
      to identify ways that digital media can serve the needs of their department.
      As demand grows for technological projects and as you broaden the diversity
      of your project teams, transformation will occur. This shift will dramatically
      affect the direction and outcome of the revolution you began. Eventually,
      project ideas will originate from outside the established &lsquo;tech&rsquo; teams.
      A curator, marketing executive or educator will one day stop you and comment, &ldquo;Would
      it be possible to create an orientation video for this upcoming exhibition?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I
      think we need an audio guide for the grounds,&rdquo; or even better, &ldquo;I
      have some money left over in my budget. What can we do?&rdquo; The seeds
      of revolution that you sowed have taken root. </p>
    <p>As people approach you with opportunities and ideas, foster their interest.
      To cultivate enthusiasm on an institutional level, it is important to keep
      the buzz alive. While it sometimes may be difficult, avoid saying no to
      ideas, and instead, if the proposal isn&rsquo;t strong, take some time
      to think creatively in order to give it a chance. Consider expanding your
      product line. By increasing the scope of your services, you may be able
      to find a digital platform to match almost any idea. Be flexible and open
      to new ideas, and in this early stage of adoption, do all that you can
      to make it work.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;As institutional adoption occurs, the biggest hurdle may become
      the scarcity of time to work on projects. This could be the perfect opportunity
      to request a larger budget to allow for more new media resources, including
      that highly desirable but usually elusive creature - the additional staff
      member. As for staff members interested in their own digital projects,
      let them act as advocates for you.&nbsp; Take advantage of the fact that
      they will be more willing to support your welfare because of their own
      enterprises. Keep in mind that they may have direct access to those in
      major decision-making positions.</p>
    <h2>Revolution To Status Quo: Make Technology Pervasive </h2>
    <p>At this point in the revolution, things are looking pretty good. By now
      you&rsquo;ve touted your successes throughout the institution, continued
      a steady flow of production, and over time, converted non-technical co-workers
      into supportive colleagues.&nbsp; At what moment does the creation of digital
      content become an institutional priority?&nbsp; If you have assembled a
      new group of supporters for the digital revolution, a group capable of
      influencing museum-wide decision-making, then you have succeeded.&nbsp; If
      this commitment to digital creation is strong enough to make it into closed-door
      budget meetings, congratulations! You have really arrived.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Producing digital content is hard work. It requires great attention to
      detail and is creatively draining.&nbsp; A revolution has occurred and
      the continued demands are high. In the past, technology was considered
      an in-gallery novelty or a once-every-two-years investment in an educational
      microsite.&nbsp; The institutional organism now thinks in terms of technology.
      Now, current exhibition teams include a technology representative well
      versed in new media production.&nbsp; Additionally, the museum&rsquo;s
      grant writers consistently feature digital projects you have produced.&nbsp; An
      early technology project might have revealed a fascinating story about
      artwork, social history or science, but new projects might be&nbsp; for
      marketing, or fundraising, or as the focal point of a complete Web redesign.
      Your revolution that began with extreme caution is now woven into the fabric
      of the museum. </p>
    <h1>Part 2 -The Basic Arsenal: A How-To Guide for Creating your Own Digital
      Audio and Video Projects</h1>
    <p>The most critical part of the production process is defining the product
      and its format. What is the story the museum is telling? In order to create
      a polished piece, be meticulous when outlining the content. What is the
      best way to tell the story? To best answer this question, you must determine
      the audience: whether it is an in-gallery or an on-line feature; why it
      is being distributed (marketing or education). Finally, identify the lead
      resource for the content of the story. This could be an educator, marketing
      executive, or member of the community. Work closely with your resources
      to better appreciate the story to be told&nbsp; through audio or video.&nbsp; </p>
    <h3>Audio</h3>
    <p>There are two clear-cut choices for distribution of your self-produced
      audio: </p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>the cell phone tour &ndash; audio information visitors can access by
        calling a provided number or </li>
      <li>the mp3 broadcast (podcast) &ndash; audio downloaded on to a personal
        mp3 player or one provided by the museum. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are strengths and shortcomings to both. To determine your means
      of delivery, several decisive factors should be considered, including physical
      feasibility (cell phone reception), availability of technology, market
      research (as mentioned in Part 1), and the project goals defined by you
      and your team .</p>
    <h4>Cell Phone Tour </h4>
    <p>The cell phone tour is a low-cost, low-maintenance, easy-to-create method
      of reaching visitors. There are a selection of companies that host cell
      phone-based audio guides independently produced by museums. Through these
      companies, you are assigned a phone number for which you can create an
      individual greeting: &ldquo;Welcome to the Museum&rsquo;s Garden and Grounds
      Cell Phone Tour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Instructions for navigating after the initial
      greeting are supplied by the host company. Once you have an account and
      assigned phone number, you can upload audio content directly to the provider&rsquo;s
      Web site.&nbsp; The information prompts (typically numbers followed by
      the pound key) are organized so that each file can be assigned to the respective
      number. You can also control whether a prompt is live or dormant, allowing
      you to easily modify seasonal or periodic information.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The flexibility of cell phone tours can be invaluable; adding, deleting,
      switching and updating audio files are easy tasks that can be accomplished
      in minutes.&nbsp; Uploading content for distribution is intuitive and straightforward.&nbsp; Projects
      associated with cell phone tours are self-sustaining, and little management
      is required. Measuring the success of cell phone tours is easy, as the
      data associated with usage is tracked and compiled by the provider. Personnel
      costs are saved by cell-phone tours because visitors own the device, eliminating
      any need for staff involvement in the distribution of audio devices.&nbsp; For
      visitors the program is intuitive, with instructions similar to automated
      customer service lines.&nbsp; Thus users have a pre-established understanding
      of and comfort level with the process.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>While the strengths of cell phone tours are numerous, the drawbacks may
      be insurmountable.&nbsp; Cell phone content is broadcast in mono audio,
      so quality can be compromised. The largest hurdle is the availability of
      cell phone coverage: dead spots will prevent access to audio content. Be
      aware that for hosted services, the phone number may not be local, and
      therefore is open to any fees associated with an individual&rsquo;s calling
      plan. This information should be communicated to your visitors.&nbsp; It
      is advisable to always keep cell phone content engaging and short so as
      not to waste people&rsquo;s minutes. While an individual&rsquo;s choice
      of service plan is out of your control, it is very important to understand
      the potential accessibility issues and criticisms of this technology.&nbsp; </p>
    <h4>Podcasts</h4>
    <p>There are two basic methods of offering a podcast.&nbsp; You can post
      audio files on your Web site and allow users to download each file. Visitors
      can then listen to these audio files from their own computers or transfer
      them to a digital audio player. The other option&nbsp; opens up your content
      to a global podcast-subscribing audience.&nbsp; To access podcast listeners
      through iTunes and other programs that gather podcast feeds, you will need
      to establish your own podcast or RSS feed for content.&nbsp; There are
      a large number of blogging programs, applications and free podcast generators
      you can utilize. Furthermore, there are a large number of on-line resources
      devoted to educating the novice podcaster. These sites can improve your
      audio broadcasting ability and help you to create a larger audience for
      your content. </p>
    <p>Because podcasts are not bound by the walls of your institution, the possibilities
      for content are limitless. In addition to tours that are relatively short
      and concise, podcasting provides the capacity to create long-running interviews
      with curators, horticulturists, and even the museum&rsquo;s CEO. The content
      that you create can have an autonomous life beyond an exhibition or gallery
      and can serve boundless audience interests for an unlimited amount of time,
      thus, maximizing your digital assets.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Podcasting can be an easy, cost-effective communication tool for museums.
      However, there are several shortcomings to consider. The audience needs
      access on-line to obtain podcasts. In addition, audiences must own a computer
      or mp3 player to download and hear the files. While the potential to reach
      a larger audience with podcasting exists, the reality is that the profile
      of podcast users may be dramatically different from your regular visitor
      profile. It&rsquo;s important to be mindful of these demographic issues
      when choosing your method of audio content delivery.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s time to consider the essentials of production. </p>

    <p>The basic tools for creating a polished audio file are the same regardless
      of the delivery method. A portable flash card audio recorder is a sensible
      and versatile investment. This device allows you to record audio in mp3
      format and easily transfer the files to your computer. The cost of flash
      card recorders varies, but a budget of $250-$600 should be sufficient.&nbsp; In
      addition to your recorder, invest in a microphone and headphones (to monitor
      the audio while recording). These two pieces are fundamental for polished
      productions and, if not included with your recorder, are reasonably priced.
      You also need to acquire software that will allow you to import, edit and
      export your sound files. Popular software programs like Audacity and Apple
      iLife&rsquo;s Garage Band are free or inexpensive audio editing programs
      that are downloadable and easy to use. Other programs such as Adobe Audition
      and Sony Soundforge operate under the same usability premises and offer
      additional features, but are higher priced.</p>
    <p>Now that you have the tools, it&rsquo;s time to record. First, you must
      select the recording environment. A quiet, undisturbed location is always
      a safe choice, but don&rsquo;t discount the benefits of ambient sound.
      The bustle of a gallery during public hours or the rustling of trees outside
      may enhance the recording by bringing your audience closer to the actual
      experience of a visit. To determine whether you have selected the right
      location and to establish your audio levels, be sure always to test before
      an event or interview. Also, consider doing several takes; this provides
      flexibility when editing and the opportunity to mash-up the best sound
      bites from several takes into one recording. </p>
    <p>When you have concluded recording and have uploaded the files to your
      computer, the editing (a.k.a. the fun, creative part) can begin. If the
      recordings went well and your files are organized, the editing process
      should be straightforward. As you review the recordings and begin to edit,
      be mindful of unnecessary pauses and verbal interruptions such as &ldquo;Ums.&rdquo;&nbsp; Removing
      these will give the track a polished, well-paced quality.&nbsp; The results
      of your editing can provide professional sound with little effort.&nbsp; Removing
      or altering audio is painless and very similar to working in a text document:
      highlight and drag to move or delete; use the tool bar to apply specific
      effects to sections of your audio. Once the editing process is complete,
      save the file as a good quality mp3, typically 128kps, 32000Hz, although
      you may be satisfied with higher or lower settings. </p>
    <h2>Video</h2>
    <p>Producing video is more complex and time-consuming than audio.&nbsp; Every
      frame of the video needs the consideration of an audio tech, videographer,
      lighting expert and editor. You will often wear many hats as an in-house
      producer. If you are willing and able to do the work, the commitment will
      pay off.&nbsp; Video offers a rich and immersive experience to your audience.&nbsp; It
      can transform a gallery space and extend the impact of your museum&rsquo;s
      experience well beyond the front door. </p>
    <h3>Creating and delivering video content </h3>
    <p>Video projects can be produced in-house with the help of your assembled
      technology team and an investment in some basic equipment.&nbsp; The costs
      of MiniDV and HDV video cameras are becoming increasingly competitive.
      These cameras range from several hundred to ten thousand dollars. The decision
      of what camera to buy is based on the expected quality of video, the format
      in which the finished piece will play, and the available budget.&nbsp; Keep
      in mind that videos produced exclusively for the Web do not need top of
      the line HDV camera,s but if quality is your ultimate criterion, it is
      beneficial to invest in a good camera early. At any level, purchasing a
      video camera, a tripod and a compatible lavaliere microphone will allow
      you to document artist interviews, live events or gallery tours. With this
      equipment you can create footage that can be combined, enhanced and transformed
      through the editing process. </p>
    <p>The decision to purchase software hinges on the knowledge and expertise
      of your editor. Applications such as iMovie (Mac), Pinnacle (PC), or Adobe
      Premiere Elements (PC) are intuitively designed for the novice user.&nbsp; These
      programs operate similarly to audio software and allow the editor easily
      to create titles and subtitles, use transitions, add music and export to
      some formats. If you happen to have staff members who are already comfortable
      editing or are naturally gifted with new media software, consider professional
      applications like Adobe Premiere Pro (PC), Avid (Mac or PC), or Final Cut
      Pro (Mac). These programs will operate similarly to iMovie or Pinnacle,
      but offer additional export options and added tools for correcting and
      manipulating your video.&nbsp; Both price options will allow you to create
      videos that look professionally produced. Editing requires a reasonably
      fast computer capable of capturing footage via a FireWire connection or
      a device that will capture video to your computer. Before you rush out
      and buy new hardware and software to edit your video, be sure that your
      Photography, IT or some other department doesn&rsquo;t already have some
      of the necessary tools.&nbsp; </p>
    <h3>Creating And Delivering Video Content</h3>
    <p>Once you have tested all of your equipment and software, you are ready
      to begin your project. Location shoots. Scripting. Storyboarding. These
      are all terms applicable to the next steps for your video. It&rsquo;s time
      to determine the visual flow of your video and decide how to make your
      vision materialize.&nbsp; Identify the desired locations for the story,
      main video and B-roll shots, interviewees, music (or other audio), and
      additional media such as images, historical materials or archived video.&nbsp; Create
      a comprehensive outline of everything needed to tell the story and make
      it flow.&nbsp; Visually map out the story from segment to segment, and
      work closely with your colleagues to define this process. While often time-consuming,
      this planning will simplify and organize the production and editing process,
      and will ultimately save you time. </p>
    <p>When the storyboarding and planning is complete, it&rsquo;s time to record.
      Most video shoots cannot be done alone, so turn to existing allies who
      support the project. You will probably need the help of your photography
      team to assist with lighting. It&rsquo;s advisable to have colleagues who
      can help conduct interviews, monitor audio, or organize logistics. Video
      shoots can be stressful, and often, unexpected issues arise. While it is
      possible to do it all yourself, it&rsquo;s always better to have a team. </p>
    <p>Some basic tips will eliminate irreversible and frustrating problems.
      It might be a video shoot, but don&rsquo;t neglect the audio. Be sure to
      utilize the audio tips mentioned in the above sections. If you are conducting
      interviews, select a quiet space with good indoor or outdoor lighting.
      Nothing destroys a video shoot more than poor lighting or background noise
      that drowns out the speaker. Always go out of your way to make the person
      on camera as comfortable as possible: the appearance of whoever is in front
      of the camera is as crucial to the final product as the skill of the person
      behind it. The tripod is a reliable tool and will provide steady, professionally
      composed shots. Operating the camera by hand can provide more flexibility,
      but be wary of shakiness (zooming-in only increases this effect). Videotapes
      are inexpensive; don&rsquo;t be afraid to let the camera roll.&nbsp; Finally,
      be mindful that as a videographer, you are providing the eyes through which
      others will have to look. Don&rsquo;t get too clever or the story might
      be lost.&nbsp; </p>
    <h3>The Editing Process</h3>
    <p>It&rsquo;s a wrap.&nbsp; Shooting for your video is complete, and it has
      been captured to your computer. You&rsquo;ve identified the additional
      media you want to include, and everyone is in agreement about the project&rsquo;s
      definition. Review all of the video, listen to the interviews (even transcribe
      them), and begin to organize the footage. At first, this process may feel
      overwhelming, but have patience: the project will slowly take shape. To
      ensure the best possible product, allow peers to view and critique early,
      middle and late versions of the piece.&nbsp; Stay true to the project&rsquo;s
      original definition and format, and allow the stories to emerge.</p>
    <h3>Exporting Video</h3>
    <p>The final format of your video will have been determined in your initial
      stages of production. Keep in mind that your editing software can either
      restrict or support this decision. Most editing programs will support burning
      to DVD, have formats that will allow direct playback on a computer, and
      have some file types suitable for Web deployment.&nbsp; For additional
      export options - video compatible in NTSC or PAL format, video for iPods,
      Flash-based applications, various computer media players, or a video suitable
      for YouTube - you should explore separate encoding software.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The good news is that the finished video can be encoded to play in practically
      any format. The better news is that creating a polished video is the biggest
      challenge. Exporting and delivering your final product to the Museum&rsquo;s
      galleries or into people&rsquo;s homes is a process that should be reasonably
      uncomplicated. Congratulations! The stories that had previously remained
      untold have now come to life through your efforts. </p>
