    <h3 class="abstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
    <p class="abstractText">The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)
      will present an informational session highlighting how IMLS grants can
      help meet the technology needs of the museum community. The session will
      be hosted by Dan Lukash, a Senior Program Officer with IMLS. He will discuss
      specifics about funding opportunities with a focus on IMLS grant programs
      that are most applicable to assist museums in addressing an institution's
      individual technology needs and/or bigger issues in the field. </p>
    <p class="abstractText">Representatives from a current grantee, the Walker
      Art Center, will provide first-hand information about developing, submitting,
      and implementing an IMLS-funded project. They will also discuss their project
      to significantly enhance the ArtsConnectED web site, including how it was
      developed based on user feedback to empower users to independently create
      their own content using an open source platform.</p>
    <p class="keywords">Keywords: grants, funding, projects, technology, support,
      national, USA</p>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>IMLS is an agency of the United States Government that provides grants
      to museums for a wide variety of museum operations and services as well
      as grants to support the museum community. This session will focus on 3
      grant categories that could best support technology project in museums
      or support the museum profession in the technology area. The three programs
      to be discussed are described below:</p>
    <h2>National Leadership Grants</h2>
    <h3>Program Overview</h3>
    <p>National Leadership Grants enable libraries and museums to help people
      gain the knowledge, skills, attitudes, behaviors, and resources that enhance
      their engagement in community, work, family, and society. Projects should
      enable libraries and museums to address current problems in creative ways,
      develop and test innovative solutions, and expand the boundaries within
      which cultural heritage institutions operate. The results of these projects
      will help equip tomorrow&rsquo;s libraries and museums to better meet the
      needs of a Nation of Learners. Successful proposals will show evidence
      that they will have national impact and generate results - new tools, research,
      models, services, practices, or alliances - that can be widely adapted
      or replicated to extend the benefit of federal support. Proposals will
      reflect an understanding of current issues and needs, showing the potential
      for far-reaching impact throughout the museum and/or library community.
      Projects will provide creative solutions to issues of national importance
      and provide leadership for other organizations.</p>
    <p>Collaborative planning grants are available to enable project teams from
      more than one institution to work together to plan a collaborative project
      in any of the National Leadership Grant categories: Building Digital Resources,
      Library and Museum Community Collaboration Grants, and Research and Demonstration</p>
    <h3>Categories of Funding</h3>
    <p><strong>Building Digital Resources: </strong>Building Digital Resources
      grants support the creation, use, preservation, and presentation of significant
      digital resources as well as the development of tools to manage digital
      assets. Projects should enhance learning and innovation by ensuring that
      the digital assets promote individual and community access to excellent,
      responsive, and pertinent museum and library resources. IMLS encourages
      digitization projects with item-level metadata that is harvestable with
      the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) Protocol for Metadata Harvesting.</p>
    <p><strong>Library and Museum Community Collaboration Grants:</strong> Community
      Collaboration Grants are designed to create new opportunities for libraries
      and museums to engage with each other, and with other organizations as
      appropriate, to support the educational, economic, and social needs of
      their communities. In addition to libraries, archives, and museums, partners
      may include community organizations, public media, and other institutions
      and agencies that may help libraries and museums to better serve their
      communities. A partnership of at least one eligible library entity AND
      one eligible museum entity is required. Additional partners are encouraged
      where appropriate. The lead applicant must be an eligible library or museum
      entity and will serve as the financial agent if a grant is awarded.</p>
    <p><strong>Research and Demonstration:</strong> Research and Demonstration
      grants support projects that have the potential to improve museum and library
      practice, resource use, programs, and services.</p>
    <p><strong>Collaborative Planning Grants:</strong> Collaborative Planning
      Grants are designed to enable project teams from libraries, museums, and
      other partner organizations to work together on a collaborative project
      in any of the National Leadership Grant categories. At least one of the
      partners must be an eligible library entity or an eligible museum entity.
      The lead applicant must be an eligible entity and will serve as the fiscal
      agent if a grant is awarded.</p>
    <h2>Museums for America</h2>
    <h3>Program Overview</h3>
    <p>Museums for America is the Institute&rsquo;s largest grant program for
      museums, providing more than $17 million in grants to support the role
      of museums in American society.</p>
    <p>Museums for America grants strengthen a museum&rsquo;s ability to serve
      the public more effectively by supporting high-priority activities that
      advance the institution&rsquo;s mission and strategic goals. </p>
    <p>In FY 2007, Museums for America funding will support projects and activities,
      designed by the institution, that strengthen museums as active resources
      for lifelong learning and as key players in the establishment of livable
      communities. Museums for America grants are designed to be flexible. They
      can be used for ongoing museum activities, research and other behind-the-scenes
      activities, planning activities, new programs or activities, purchase of
      equipment or services, or other activities that will support the efforts
      of museums to upgrade and integrate new technologies into their overall
      institutional effectiveness. </p>
    <p>The Institute seeks to distribute funding for Museums for America grants
      across all types and sizes of museums, as well as among all funding categories.
      Applicants may apply in one of three funding categories: $5,000-$24,999,
      $25,000-$74,999, or $75,000-$150,000. A 1:1 match is required in each category.
      All applications must demonstrate evidence of institutional strategic planning
      and show the relationship between the activities for which funding is requested
      and the institution&rsquo;s plan. Although project activities may occur
      only once, project goals should be investments for the future, not one-time
      activities with no long-term impact on the museum or its community. </p>
    <h2>21<sup>st</sup> Century Museum Professionals</h2>
    <h3>Program Overview</h3>
    <p>Museums play a critical role in the education of the public by preserving
      the world&rsquo;s rich cultural heritage and helping to transmit it from
      one generation to the next. Museum professionals need high levels of knowledge
      and expertise as they help create public value for both local and national
      communities. This program supports projects that help museum professionals
      acquire, improve, and maintain their knowledge and skills.</p>
    <p>21st Century Museum Professionals grants are intended to reach broad groups
      of museum professionals throughout a city, county, state, region, or the
      nation and increase their capacities to serve their audiences. These projects
      should reach multiple institutions and diverse audiences.</p>
    <p>Funding will support projects involving core management skills such as
      planning, leadership, finance, program design, partnership, and evaluation.
      Project focus areas may also include, but not be limited to, collections
      care and management, interpretation, marketing and audience development,
      visitor services, governance, and other areas of museum operations. Proposals
      may also focus on projects that help museums attract and retain staff,
      and improve the capacity of museums to address the rapidly changing demographics
      in many communities.</p>
    <p>Examples of project activities include the development and implementation
      of classes and workshops; organizational support for the development of
      internship and fellowship programs; support for the enhancement of pre-professional
      training programs; dissemination of information through publications, Web
      sites, or other means; and activities that strengthen the use of contemporary
      technology tools to deliver programs and services. </p>
    <h1>Grantee Presentation</h1>
    <h3>Walker Art Center &ndash; Minneapolis, MN </h3>
    <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2006<br />
      <strong>Amount:</strong> $287,125 <br />
      <strong>Grant:</strong>National Leadership Grants for Museums - Building
      Digital Resources<br />
      The Walker Art Center and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts will continue
      their strong partnership in a project to enhance and provide access to
      their ArtsConnectEd Web site. The first version, created in 1998, has been
      very successful, but now new technologies and new needs have created an
      opportunity to enhance the service this Web site already provides. This
      improvement will permit the site to be a dynamic, open source site that
      allows educators to create and manage the content of the educational material
      and respond more directly to teacher needs. Teachers have expressed a strong
      desire for the resources and flexibility to revise the content as their
      classroom needs change. There will be a project report as well as a project
      blog. In addition, on-line seminars will be held for museum professionals
      to learn how to create or replicate features that are of interest for their
      own institutions.</p>
    <p>The project director will discuss the application process and will detail
      some of the activities in the project. The discussion will include information
      on the evaluation process, how user feedback will then be incorporated
      into the new Web site, and the nature of the open source dynamic. </p>
