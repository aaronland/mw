    <h1>Introduction </h1>
    <p>There are actual skeletons of dinosaurs in a natural history museum. However,
      visitors do not really know what a dinosaur looked like when it was alive;
      for example, the contour of the body or its skin color. In this research,
      by using <strong>mixed reality</strong> (MR) technology with a handheld
      PC, they can view and reconstruct the flesh of the dinosaur on display
      in the gallery. In this paper we will describe this system, its contents
      and the authoring tool. </p>
    <p>In the current museum display system, to superimpose an animation on to
      an exhibit a system using a half mirror, called &ldquo;fanta-view&rdquo; or &ldquo;magic-vision&quot;,
      has been used in the gallery. However, it is not an interactive system.
      On the other hand, a three-dimensional computer graphics (3DCG) technology
      used with a personal computer has been gaining popularity in recent years.
      Because of this, the potential of using interactive 3DCG technology for
      museum display is currently increasing. </p>
    <p>Mixed Reality (MR) is in between the virtual and the real environment
      (Milgram &amp; Colquhoun, 1999). MR is similar to Virtual Reality (VR)
      technology except that it can merge interactive 3DCG with the real world.
      In other words, although the majority of VR contents are made from only
      computer graphics, MR contents are made from computer graphics in the real
      world. In this research, the real world is a museum gallery or an exhibit.
      To use both virtual and real is important in the educational field at a
      museum because the technology can overlap layers of information such as
      comments or interactive explanations. </p>
    <p>Examples of MR applications for museums, include, for example, a user
      who wears a head-mounted display (HMD) with a camera can see virtual buildings
      reproduced at the actual archaeological site of Olympia (Stricker &amp; Kettenbach,
      2001) and can see an animation of people living at the archaeological areas
      of Pompei (Papagiannakis et al., 2005). The virtual showcase is a museum
      display showcase that combined stereo 3DCG with a real exhibit using half
      mirrors (Bimber et al., 2001). A handheld augmented reality museum guide
      is a mixed reality system using a PDA (Schmalstieg &amp; Wagner, 2005).</p>
    <p>The purpose of this study is to use a museum display to illustrate how
      practical and simple it is to use MR technology. The system used will be
      an MR display system, a content authoring system, and a Web-based 3DCG
      texture painting system.</p>
    <h1>A Mixed Reality System</h1>
    <h2>Media Characteristics of Virtual Reality, Web3D and Mixed Reality</h2>
    <p>In order to apply 3DCG in a museum, there are various possible methods;
      for example, Virtual Reality, Web3D, and Mixed Reality. These consist of
      different systems and each system has specific media characteristics. Figures
      1-3 present the contents of the same church in France. Figure 1 shows the
      result of using the immersive VR system called CAVE. The operator enters
      into a 3m cube, and by using stereoscopic vision, can have the experience
      of being in the actual church. Figure 2 shows the same building using Web3D,
      which displays 3DCG on an Internet browser. Although an immersive VR system
      is more realistic than Web3D, financially Web3D is more practical. Figure
      3 shows the exterior of the same church displayed on top of a hand. In
      an MR environment, the displayed image can be shown on a person&rsquo;s
      hand; therefore, the operator can experience an animated image, which is
      embedded on an actual hand in a normal environment. MR also can be used
      in the real church. For example, it can show murals and paintings with
      annotations etc. on the actual ceiling painting.</p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 3: Mixed Reality</p>
    <h2>Elemental Technology of Mixed Reality</h2>
    <p>There are several MR display systems; for example, a half mirror system
      (Bimber et al., 2001), a video see-through HMD with built-in small video
      cameras (Uchiyama et al. 2002), and a PDA with a video camera (Schmalstieg &amp; Wagner,
      2005) etc. All of these systems are a combination of reality mixed with
      3DCG technology.</p>
    <p>Moreover, MR technology also has tracking technology in which an animated
      image can follow a person&rsquo;s head or hand. In such a tracking method,
      there are a magnetic position sensors, gyroscopes, etc., to calculate position
      and inclination by recognizing the images of the two-dimensional markers
      in the real world &ndash; image recognition (Papagiannakis et al., 2005),
      etc. This two-dimensional marker tracking method was used in this study.</p>
    <h2>Development and Operating Environment</h2>
    <p>ARToolKit (Kato &amp; Billinghurst, 1999) was used to develop the contents
      in this study. It is a software library for creating a mixed reality environment.
      It uses a two-dimensional marker for tracking. A key feature of using ARToolKit
      is that no special equipment is needed. Therefore this technology is well
      suited for educational purposes. The development was done in the following
      environment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>OS: Windows 2000 Professional</li>
      <li>Compiler: Microsoft Visual C++6.0</li>
      <li>Graphics library: OpenGL+GLUT</li>
      <li>Multimedia API: Microsoft DirectX 8.0 SDK</li>
      <li>Mixed Reality library: ARToolKit 2.65</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The application can be operated on an Intel Pentium III 600MHz or higher
      with Windows2000 / XP. A high-speed graphic accelerator card works well
      with OpenGL, and a Web camera or a video camera connection is necessary. </p>
    <h1>Museum Display System</h1>
    <p>In this system, using a handheld pc with a camera allows replication of
      the look of the dinosaur, overlaying the actual skeleton. Figure 4 is a
      picture from the National Science museum in Tokyo. Figure 5 shows a half-transparent
      3DCG with the names of the body parts, all displayed on a handheld PC. </p>
    <p>The purpose of this content is not only for children to have a better
      understanding of what dinosaurs looked like before, but also for children
      to learn to think scientifically about dinosaurs. Using academic theories,
      children can modify the skin color. For example, Figure 6 is an example
      of skin color. This system offers an interactive function which asks the
      children to choose a specific skin color for a specific purpose.</p>

    <h1>An Authoring Tool for Mixed Reality Contents</h1>
    <p>The MR content that was used in this research project was developed using
      ARToolKit. Knowledge of C++ and OpenGL is required for this development,
      and it is difficult for general users to develop their own contents. An
      authoring tool will eliminate the hassle of traditional C++ programming
      which needs a lot of time and experience. Then the general user will be
      able to spend more time developing content instead of programming.</p>
    <p>The user-friendly authoring tool that was developed to produce MR content
      such as the museum display system permits content to be easily developed
      in a short period of time using a two-dimensional marker or markers. </p>
    <p>To create the contents, it is necessary to prepare a 3D object or a 3D
      animation separately, with 3D modeling software. The fundamental function
      of the authoring tool makes this 3D object correspond to the selected marker.
      The number of markers, the position, and the size can be specified, and
      positioning of the 3D object and zooming are possible. Furthermore, it
      also allows annotations, sounds, and hyperlinks. Figure 7 shows an authoring
      process to set a marker and a 3D model.</p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig7" id="Fig7"></a><a href="kondo-fig7.html"><img src="kondo.fig7.jpg" alt="Fig 6: Examples of skin color of the dinosaFig 7: Authoring tool for mixed reality contents" width="400" height="140" border="0" /></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 7: Authoring tool for mixed reality contents</p>
    <h2>Authoring Tool Specifications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Marker position: The number of markers, the position, and the size
        can be specified.</li>
      <li>3D Object's file formats: This software supports MQO (Metasequoia)
        and VRML file formats.</li>
      <li>Annotation: VRML file</li>
      <li>Hyperlink: It can set hyperlinks from an annotation. </li>
      <li>Cut: It can set cuts in a scene. </li>
      <li>Preview </li>
      <li>Pattern file: Pattern files can be generated automatically.</li>
      <li>Marker: It can print real size markers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Web-Based Painting Tool For Dinosaur's Skin</h2>
    <p>MR technology can be used not only for museum guides but also for hands-on
      experience. Currently, a Web-based painting tool for dinosaur's skin is
      now under development (Figure 8) using Flash, mySQL and PHP. A picture
      designed by children can be saved on the server. . Children can take pictures
      of animals, for instance, and use those pictures as the base of developing
      their own choice of skin textures to be used when viewing the 3D model
      of the dinosaur skeleton. Then, using MR technology at the museum (Figure
      9), those children can see the dinosaur with their choice of skin over
      its skeleton The purpose of the application is not to create art, but to
      understand more about science by optimizing the dinosaur skin and by using
      some filters such as shade and a splash effect,. In the end, a picture
      will be taken of the student creators with their skin texture choices overlapping
      the dinosaur and themselves in the picture, and they will be able to receive
      printed copies of those pictures.</p>
    <p>This paint tool under development has the following functions: </p>
    <p>select a dinosaur, select the brush thickness, select a solid or blur
      style brush, transparent brush, loading a picture file, stamping, editing
      the stamp, undo/redo, save the design and upload to the server. The server
      has the highest level design ranking functions.</p>

    <h1>Conclusions And Future Work</h1>
    <p>In this research project, we have given an example of the use of MR technology
      at a natural history museum. First, we explained about the media characteristics
      of MR, VR and Web3D. Secondly, we presented the MR content of a dinosaur
      exhibit with its museum display. Thirdly, we introduced an authoring tool
      for MR contents. Finally, we reported on a Web-based painting tool which
      is under development for MR. In concluding, we propose possible and practical
      uses that may change current museum display systems by using MR technology.
      Our aim is to give children in a museum a tool to help them think more
      scientifically. MR content can change the skin image of a dinosaur, and
      the painting tool can recreate a virtual animal; MR technology can change
      the way children learn.</p>
    <p>A future version of this museum display system that uses MR technology
      will be a marker-less system and will have a more intuitive interface.
      Specifically, we are planning to use a magnetic positioning sensor, a haptic
      device, and an acceleration sensor such the Nintendo Wii controller as
      an operating interface. Lastly, we will release shortly an English version
      of the authoring tool. </p>
