				      broadcasting using a mobile phone is one of the newest ways we are
				      applying technology at the National Museum of Nature and Science in
				      Tokyo, Japan. A mobile phone can provide live broadcasting capabilities
				      for museum galleries, school classrooms, community centers and even
				      fossil sites. With the right kind of equipment; namely, an audio/video
				      port on the phone, this type of broadcasting can be simple to set up,
				      dynamic and spontaneous. Common concerns regarding resolution quality
				      and phone charge expense are not onerous, compared to other modes of
				      information delivery. The image is good enough to allow people to communicate
				      clearly. Also, communication charges are a pittance compared to the
				      cost of transporting a lecturer to a venue. Phone broadcasting is an
				      opportunity for interactive activity that allows different groups to
				      defy spatial constraints. We provide details on several recent telecommunication
				      experiences with links in Japan and abroad.</p>

				  <h1>The Museum Community in Japan and Mobile Phones </h1>
				  <p>We have moved far beyond using the mobile phone as a simple portable
				    telephone. Mobile phones are regularly being updated to include
				    new technologies (Markoff, 2007). We now feel comfortable sending short
				    text messages and e-mails. Some of us (especially the younger demographic)
				    use our phones to take, save, and send photos and video clips and
				    surf the Net. Some new phones allow users to watch TV programs
				    broadcast for ordinary television. The mobile phone has been gaining
				    popularity recently as a platform for content delivery, whether as an
				    audio guide, or a conduit to receive audio or video images from a phone
				    feed or the Internet (Fushimi, 2006). Continual design innovations, economical
				    pricing, and portability make it a device that has excited considerable
				    interest among museum professionals. Similar to our experience in Japan,
				    others are experimenting around the globe with these highly personalized
				    portable tour guides at museums and outdoor attractions such as zoos,
				    gardens, historical sites and cultural heritage sites (Bressling, 2006;
				    Nickerson, 2005).  </p>
				  <p>For the past four years, a research team at the National Museum of Nature
				    and Science (formerly known as the National Science Museum) has been
				    comparing different types of devices for their efficacy regarding content
				    delivery and information retrieval. Overall, we have determined that
				    the iPod works well as an audio guidance system because it offers the
				    opportunity for free downloading, notification of new programs through
				    RSS feeds, and the flexibility and creativity inherent in podcasting.<strong> </strong>Due
				    to its user-friendliness and its wide
				    screen, game machines like PlayStation PSP&reg; or Nintendo DS&reg; work
				    well for content that requires a picture as well as audio guidance. Nintendo
				    has a two-screen capability, increasing usability.<strong> </strong>Mobile
				    phones have several advantages over iPods and game machines: namely,
				    Quick Response code (QR code) readability, the capacity to send and receive
				    photographs, the capacity to send a photograph with GPS location data,
				    and live broadcasting capability. <strong></strong></p>
				  <h2>Quick Response Code</h2>
				  <p>In Japan, the QR code (<a href="../http://www.denso-wave.com/qrcode/index-e.html" target="_blank">http://www.denso-wave.com/qrcode/index-e.html</a>) allows
				      a mobile phone user to automatically read a URL address instead of
				      typing in the URL address. It works in this manner. The visitor takes
				      a photo of the QR code. The QR code has a URL embedded in it. By taking
				      a photo of the QR code, the URL of the Web page is displayed on the
				      phone screen. The visitor then selects the URL, and an image and/or
				      a short video downloads to the mobile
				      phone from a Web page. </p>
				  <p>As an example, images were sent from a laboratory and made available
				    to the general public. During the exhibition <em>Dino Expo 2005: Evolution
				    from Birds to Dinosaurs</em>, the National
				    Museum of Nature and Science sent images that were downloadable to mobile
				    phones. At the start of the exhibition, the museum began raising the
				    kind of pigeons that formed, in part, Charles Darwin&rsquo;s foundation
				    for his theory of evolution. Scientists sent live broadcast images of
				    the pigeons from the laboratory to exhibition monitors at the museum.
				    Short video images or a still image were
				    also made available for downloading to mobile phones via a QR code system.
				    The bar code was printed and pasted on the wall of the exhibition. Visitors
				    possessing a mobile phone equipped with a QR code reader could use this
				    service. </p>
				  <p>Another use for the QR code is its record-keeping function. Organizers
				    can track the number of hits to a Web site. In our trial, the short video
				    was downloaded more than 6000 times in five months (Manabe and Lydens,
				    in press). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
				  <p>For a study designed to use mobile phones to connect cultural institutions,
				    the National Museum of Nature and Science and Ueno Zoo worked together
				    to create work- sheets viewable on mobile phones. These two institutions
				    are located in the same large public park, and we wanted to create a
				    natural connection for people, to give them an incentive to visit the
				    museum and the zoo on the same day. The trial was called &ldquo;Zoo-Mu
				    Expeditions&rdquo; (Arita-Kikutani and Sakamoto, in press). The worksheet
				    encouraged people to make comparisons between the live animals at the
				    zoo, such as our pandas, and a skeleton on display in the museum. A participant
				    could look at the hand structure of the bones of the skeleton in the
				    museum and then go to the zoo and see how the panda grasps a piece of
				    bamboo while feeding. Participants could access the worksheets via their
				    mobile phones through the use of the &ldquo;pattobi&rdquo; code (www.pattobi.jp/pc/index.html)or
				    the QR code. </p>
				  <h2>Taking and Sending Photographs</h2>
				  <p>In an imaginative use for mobile phones geared at the younger set, a
				    media forum was created in cooperation with an NPO called <strong>e-kids</strong> (<a href="../http://www.e-kids.or.jp/" target="_blank">http://www.e-kids.or.jp</a>).
				    The main purpose was to encourage children to record wildlife
				    with their own digital camera. A &lsquo;media camp&rsquo; familiarized
				    children with nature and gave them tips on technology use.
				    The resulting photographs of plants and animals taken by
				    the children encouraged organizers to generate an Internet
				    picture book of the photo collection.&nbsp; This
				    Internet picture book is a BioMap database collection. To
				    participate, children take a photo of a plant or animal using
				    their mobile phone and transmit the image, along with identifying
				    information such as date, weather conditions, location, type
				    of plant/wildlife, and any personal comments (www.biomap.e-kids.or.jp).
				    The image is added to a database which can then be used by
				    others to search for a specific type of wildlife or the location
				    of a certain plant. </p>
				  <h2>Taking and Sending Photographs
				      with a GPS reading</h2>
				  <p>The Mt. Fuji Club in Japan is demonstrating
				      the applicability of the mobile phone to a wide range of
				    applications in Japan. This NPO uses GPS-equipped mobile
				    phones to record and maintain the <em>Garbage Map at Mount Fuji</em> (<a href="../http://fujisan1.docomo-sys.com/eco/Top.aspx" target="_blank">http://fujisan1.docomo-sys.com/eco/Top.aspx</a>). A
				      volunteer takes a photograph of garbage on Mt. Fuji. The
				    GPS-enabled camera phone automatically positions the location
				    of the trash on a map. This information is gathered cumulatively
				    to monitor the
				      environmental condition of Mt. Fuji.</p>
				  <h1>Using Mobile Phones for
				      Live Broadcasting in Japan: Broadcasting Between the Museum, the Classroom,
				      the Fossil Site, and Overseas</h1>
				  <h2>From the Museum to the
				      Classroom</h2>
				  <p>A dinosaur paleontologist
				      from the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo
				    gave a series of five one-hour lectures to classrooms of
				    primary schools and high schools in Ehime Prefecture, a rural
				    agricultural and fishery area 900 km from Tokyo. Each broadcast
				    consisted of a 30-minute lecture featuring the paleontologist
				    and a 30-minute question-and-answer session. The National
				    Museum of Nature and Science cooperated with the Ehime Prefectural
				    Library Ehime Prefectural Library (<a href="../http://www.pref.ehime.jp/" target="_blank">http://www.pref.ehime.jp</a>) in
				      Matsuyama to produce the broadcasts at the end 2005 and
				    in early 2006.</p>
				  <p>The librarians ordinarily
				      have ongoing outreach programs designed for children who live in isolated
				      areas. The dinosaur lectures were a part of this outreach program.
				      Librarians were sent out from the Ehime Prefectural Library to community
				      centers and schools in small villages. They brought books on the dinosaur
				      theme for the children. Some were read aloud to younger children. Reading
				      books beforehand about the topic (several were written by the paleontologist
				      from our team) helped the children to devise questions to ask during
				      the question-and-answer session.</p>
				  <p>The lectures for the mobile
				      broadcast series were broadcast from the galleries at the National
				      Museum of Nature and Science. The paleontologist walked through different
				      galleries in the museum as he delivered his lecture. He prepared a rough
				      script in advance and did several camera tests in order to select suitable
				      contents and settings for the broadcast. Phone connectivity was confirmed
				      before the session. There were two
				      cameras on the sending phone, and during the broadcast the paleontologist
				      switched between showing his face and the museum displays he was talking
				      about. During the phone call, the paleontologist&rsquo;s image and
				      the museum displays were projected via the receiving mobile phone to
				      a screen or a television in the other location. </p>
				  <p>In order to enhance the live atmosphere, we sent a
				    cast of the dinosaur specimen to the classroom in advance. The teachers/librarians
				    could demonstrate the cast in the classroom and sometimes even pass around
				    the cast to the students. In this way, the paleontologists and the students
				    could look at virtually identical specimens, despite the distance separating
				    the two parties. During the question-and-answer session, the children
				    had the chance to satisfy their curiosity
				    by asking questions directly to the paleontologist. Children expressed
				    their enthusiasm for dinosaurs and their curiosity about the mysteries
				    of evolution and extinction. Many children wanted to know about the paleontologist
				    himself, asking questions about how he got interested in paleontology
				    and what his job is like. There
				    were always more questions asked than the paleontologist had time to
				    answer within the allocated time. Thus, it was demonstrated that
				    an expert can create a real-time experience in a special museum exhibition
				    for children who live miles away from the exhibition. </p>
				  <h2>From the Fossil Site
				      to the Museum</h2>
				  <p>Another trial involved
				      making a broadcast from a dinosaur fossil site to a museum
				    that is located a long distance away. In an orientation session,
				    a paleontologist speaking from the fossil site in Ishikawa
				    prefecture explained to the Chiba prefecture museum visitors
				    how to prospect fossils <a href="../http://www.chiba-muse.or.jp/NATURAL/english/index-e.htm" target="_blank">(http://www.chiba-muse.or.jp/NATURAL/english/index-e.htm</a>).
				      At the conclusion of the broadcast session, visitors had
				    the chance to try their hand at prospecting fossils from
				    rocks that were shipped to Chiba for the purpose. This arrangement
				    gives the visitor a hands-on experience in a museum, guided
				    by a professional who is standing at a fossil site. </p>
				  <p>As a way to orient visitors
				      to a fossil site before a visit, a museum in the southernmost
				    island of Japan used a mobile phone broadcast to show visitors
				    the fossil site ahead of time. This helped visitors know
				    what to expect before they went to the site. The Kitakyushu Museum of
				    Natural History and Human History found that this was an
				    effective way to prepare visitors for their forthcoming trip
				    to the fossil site (<a href="../http://www.kmnh.jp/index_e.html" target="_blank">http://www.kmnh.jp/index_e.html</a>). </p>
				  <p>Another trial involved
				      a collaborative effort between a team at the National Museum of Nature
				      and Science and a group of colleagues in a location outside of Japan.
				      In February 2004, a team of National Museum of Nature and Science educators
				      participated in a dinosaur fossil dig in southern Victoria, Australia.
				      This program was organized by the Monash Science Center in Melbourne
				      (www.sci.monash.edu.au/msc). </p>
				  <p>The team of Japanese educators
				      gave a live report from Australia to museum visitors in the dinosaur
				      gallery. </p>
				  
				  <h1>Five Reasons to Use Mobile
				      Phones for Live Broadcasting</h1>
				  <ol>
				    <li>The
				      universal appeal of the device. Mobile phones are widely used worldwide.
				      No special equipment is needed; the only requirement is that the sending
				      phone must have a camera and the receiving phone needs to have a camera
				      and an audiovisual outlet. </li>
				    <li>The
				      opportunity for interactive participation. Using a mobile phone enables
				      everyone to participate. Parties on both ends of the phone line can,
				      at various times, be the information provider or the information receiver.</li>
				    <li>Freedom
				      from a wireless network. Unlike computer webcams, broadcasting with
				      a mobile phone allows the user to be free of the LAN area. Indeed,
				      the broadcast can be conducted outdoors, as long as there is a phone
				      connection. Another
				      advantage is that the individual can move freely about while delivering
				      a speech or lecture. He or she does not have to stand in front of a
				      fixed camera or computer webcam.</li>
				    <li>Cost
				      effectiveness. Minimal equipment is required: a mobile phone, a cable,
				      and a screen or a facsimile of a screen. The phone call is not likely
				      to be expensive, either.</li>
			        <li>The
				      opportunity to view
				      a live, real-time lecture. This is especially applicable when it is
				      not possible for a lecturer to make a personal appearance. From our
				      trials at the National Museum of Nature and Science, we learned that
				      if specimens are used in both locations during the lecture, this can
				      considerably improve the level of communication and the overall experience
				      between participants in the two venues.  </li>
			    </ol>
				  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
				  <p>Now that we have used the mobile phone for live broadcasting, we can
				    confidently say that there are many situations where it is appropriate
				    to use this mode of information delivery. It does not have to be limited
				    to the museum environment, either. Libraries and museums can, for example,
				    coordinate a lecture from a paleontologist in a museum to children in
				    a community center or a classroom. A librarian can be on hand to do a
				    book talk and display books on dinosaurs to pique children's interest
				    in the natural sciences. We will continue to encourage these collaborations
				    among institutions. We are also planning to make a live broadcast available
				    on the Internet in order to share the event with more locations and to
				    record and archive the live broadcast programs. </p>
