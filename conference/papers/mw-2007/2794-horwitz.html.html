      <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="abstractText">Remember that wonderful feeling you had when you
        visited a museum? You could go to whatever exhibit interested you. You
        could wander aimlessly or stare intently as long as you liked. You could
        fill yourself with knowledge or gloss over all the information and just
        look. You could stay as long as you liked or leave when you were through.
        Students can have the same opportunities in classrooms by using virtual
        museums. Virtual museums are new tools in the technology arsenal that
        allow teachers to promote standards for their subjects as well as promote
        reading, writing and research. They give students the opportunity to
        wander through and wonder at the world&rsquo;s best museums with the
        same freedom that we experienced with our actual visits.</p>
      <p class="abstractText">Museums have the objects that pertain to the subjects
        teachers teach. A good, interactive, museum Web site provides teachers
        with dynamic material that hooks students in ways textbooks cannot. Interactive
        museum Web sites can align information to standards for English, math,
        science, social studies, fine arts, and technology. Students are the
        museum audiences of the future and as such need to be acclimated to possibilities
        of virtual museums by seeing collections in their classrooms. Museums
        with the right Web sites are the portals.</p>
      <p class="abstractText">We propose to demonstrate how teachers align instruction
        to standards, how we choose a Web site from an Internet search, and how
        we integrate the museum Web sites into the classroom lesson to broaden
        and enhance instruction. We want our students to wonder at and wander
        through the museums of the world</p>

    <h1 class="PaperTitle">Introduction</h1>
    <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Horwitz, look what I found in the mummy!&rdquo; shouts an
      excited sixth grader exploring the British Museum&rsquo;s Ancient Egyptian
      site as part of a social studies lesson. &ldquo;I will think about art
      differently now,&rdquo; another student writes in an impromptu response
      after viewing Vermeer paintings from the Rijksmuseum to support a unit
      on the book <em>Chasing Vermeer </em>by Blue Balliett. &ldquo;Ms. Intemann,
      look at this amazing silk painting,&rdquo; says a seventh grader learning
      to appreciate the beauty in Chinese art found in the museum of the Forbidden
      City while reading <em>Ma Yan&rsquo;s Diary-The Hopes and Dreams of a Chinese
      School Girl</em> by Ma Yan. These are some of our experiences as we began
      using virtual museums to enhance classroom instruction.</p>
    <p>A history that brought us to this place is relevant to our discussion
      of using virtual museums in the classroom. Rachel Horwitz attended the
      2006 international conference of Museums and the Web as a public school
      librarian intrigued by the concept. When she returned to school, her enthusiasm
      was contagious, and she found a willing listener and co-participant in
      Cathy Intemann, a 7<sup>th</sup> grade language arts and literature teacher.
      We began our partnership by planning a presentation for the New Mexico
      Council of Teachers of English fall conference in October 2006. Our theme
      was linking virtual museums to literature that could be used in the classroom.
      Rachel searched for young adult literature (appropriate for sixth through
      eighth graders) that could be linked to a virtual museum. We made an extensive
      list of literature with Web sites that supported the literature. Our themes
      varied from the Holocaust to Abraham Lincoln and the Newberry Award winning
      book <em>Lincoln: A Photobiography</em>, to Egypt and the book, <em>Mara,
      Daughter of the Nile</em><strong>, </strong>to another Newberry winner, <em>Crispin,
      Cross of Lead</em>, set in Medieval Europe. The bibliography shows the
      result of our initial searches. </p>
    <p>Cathy was searching for ways to bring these museum Web sites into her
      classroom and incorporate them into reading, writing and research activities.</p>
    <p>Our original presentation to the English teachers has subsequently expanded
      to include more subject areas such as social studies and science. It also
      has given us the opportunity to evaluate museum Web sites more closely
      as we continue our search for the perfect match between student and museum
      Web site.</p>
    <h1>Our School and its Demographics</h1>
    <p>McKinley Middle School is a 53-year-old school in the middle of Albuquerque,
      New Mexico. Our students come from mainly working class families, with
      many single parents. The population is fairly transient, and 75% of our
      students are eligible for free and reduced cost lunch. They represent the
      ethnic and cultural make-up of the city of Albuquerque itself. We have
      a predominantly Hispanic population but we also have a high percentage
      of Native American students from the surrounding pueblos and the reservations
      of the Navajo, Hopi and Zuni to our west. We also have a small population
      of African American, Asian American, and immigrant students from places
      such as Kosovo, Croatia, Afghanistan, and, of course Mexico, and Latin
      America. We have a high population of special education students and English
      as second language students.</p>
    <p>Albuquerque and New Mexico have many museums that our students can visit
      with their family or with their schools. We have the New Mexico Museum
      of Natural History, the Albuquerque Museum of Art, an Atomic Museum, a
      children&rsquo;s, hands-on museum-Explora, a hot air balloon museum, as
      well as state museums in the capital city, Santa Fe, just 50 miles away.
      We also have a variety of smaller independent museums and museums affiliated
      with the University of New Mexico, such as the anthropology, geology, and
      art museums. Even with these many opportunities, some students&rsquo; sole
      experiences with museums are trips organized by teachers and taken with
      classmates. Many of them have never been out of state or out of the immediate
      region. Their personal lives are filled only with the popular culture of
      TV, video games, play stations and Internet and radio and whatever culture
      the home provides. Their cultural landscape is fairly barren.</p>
    <h2>New Mexico Standards</h2>
    <p>As with most of the states in the U.S., teachers are required to build
      their curriculum and instruction around standards that are designed for
      their subject area by strands. These are then broken down further into
      benchmarks, content standards and finally performance standards. Benchmarks
      cover several grades while content and performance standards relate to
      a specific grade. (<a href="../http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk);/" target="_blank">http://</a><a href="../http://www.ped.state.nm.us/standards/index.html." target="_blank">www.ped.state.nm.us/standards/index.html.</a>)
      These standards are roughly based on national standards from the respective
      professional teacher organizations. The National Council of Teachers of
      English have standards, (<a href="../http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk);/" target="_blank">http://</a><a href="../http://www.ncte.org/" target="_blank">www.ncte.org</a>),
      as well as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, (www.nctm.org),
      the National Council for Social Studies, (<a href="../http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk);/" target="_blank">http://</a><a href="../http://www.ncss.org/" target="_blank">www.ncss.org</a>)
      and the National Academies of Science (www.nsta.org). Even subjects in
      the Fine Arts have state and national standards (www.naea-reston.org.)
      Not only does the state have standards, but our local school district has
      standards as well, and these are slightly different from the state standards
      as we have six strands. (ww2.aps.edu.)</p>
    <h2>Typical Lessons Involving the Web </h2>
    <h3>Literature</h3>
    <p>Here is how a typical lesson would evolve using standards. The New Mexico
      Standards for seventh grade requires a seventh grade student to &ldquo;analyze
      how literature expresses and transmits culture&rdquo; (APS Language Arts
      standards 7<sup>th</sup> grade). Cathy wants to teach <em>The Diary of
      Ma Yan</em> by Ma Yan. This recent book is an autobiographical diary of
      a teenaged girl from a rural province in China who desperately wants to
      go to school. She has great difficulty because of her family&rsquo;s poverty,
      the distance of the school, the cost for her to attend, and the need for
      her help at home. Cathy plans to read the diary with her students but also
      wants to incorporate writing experiences with her reading. She plans to
      have her students keep a diary as well while they read the book. She will
      give the entry for each day. The standard that states the student &ldquo;expresses
      individual perspective on personal, social, cultural and historical issues,&rdquo; will
      meet her purpose. Now, how else can she make the girl&rsquo;s story and
      her dilemma come alive? Cathy plans three other activities. She uses an
      Internet site that translates her students' names into Chinese characters.
      But still she is concerned that the very different values of the Chinese
      culture will not be clearly comprehended by her students. So she wanders
      to the library where she asks Rachel to find examples of Chinese culture.
      Rachel finds an <em>interactive </em>and easy to navigate Web site (<a href="../http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk);/" target="_blank">http://www.dpm.org.en/English</a>)
      at the Museum of the Forbidden City, the Palace Museum. Cathy evaluates
      the Web site and plans how she will integrate the website.</p>
    <p>She schedules time at our library computer lab. Here students come to
      do research using the computers. We have two other computer labs, but these
      are used for technology classes as part of the scheduled day. Rachel gives
      a brief introduction to the Web site and the museum. Cathy and Rachel decide
      they will have students examine various prized items from a collection
      and a second collection of items that women cherish. Cathy has elected
      not to make the students do any writing on their findings. She encourages
      students to look at a wide range of items from both collections. </p>
    <p>As the students roam virtually through the various artifacts, Cathy and
      Rachel walk around and converse with students about what they observe.
      When we return to class, Cathy continues the discussion with her whole
      class. She asks students to describe what the Chinese value. Students should
      be able to do this after reading the book and looking at the collection
      from the virtual museum Web site. All of these activities: reading <em>Ma
      Yan&rsquo;s Diary</em><strong>, </strong>writing in their own diary, using
      the Internet to find their name in Chinese characters, using the virtual
      museum, and taking a test, should meet the standards Cathy originally prepared
      her lesson around.</p>
    <h3>Mystery</h3>
    <p>Cathy also taught a mystery<em> Chasing Vermeer </em>by Blue Balliett.
      In this book the painting <em>A Lady Writing</em> is stolen from the Museum
      of Art in Chicago. Two young detectives, Petra and Calder, try to recover
      the painting and find out who stole it. It seems only appropriate to examine
      Vermeer paintings if we are going to understand the references to Vermeer.
      Off we go to the library again, this time to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam
      to look at the Vermeer paintings. Why go to the museum when we can look
      at prints from images on Google? There are two reasons. The first is that
      the museum has set up the site so we can zoom in and look at specific portions
      of the painting and there are four together that we can look at, compare,
      and contrast. The second is that we can take our students to a real museum
      and peek at their collection. We can&rsquo;t do that with an image from
      Google. Cathy met the following standards with this book and the activities
      she taught: a student &ldquo;analyzes a variety of literary selections
      such as mystery,&rdquo; and a student &ldquo;interprets information that
      is read, heard, or viewed.&rdquo;  (APS Language Arts standards 7<sup>th</sup> grade.)
      She concluded by having her students make a poster about the book, with
      specific parameters that she included.</p>
    <h3>Writing Assignments</h3>
    <p>Cathy also used a museum Web site for two writing assignments. She was
      working on descriptive writing and wanted her students to practise writing
      about a place. We read several stories and essays where setting was important.
      Then with Rachel&rsquo;s assistance, we again traveled to a virtual museum.
      We looked at landscape paintings at the National Gallery of Art in London
      (<a href="../http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/)</a> .
      Each student picked a landscape and used descriptive language to explain
      the setting depicted. This was a challenging assignment for the students.
      She used the same Web site for her lesson on describing the physical and
      personal characteristics of people. We again read a variety of literature
      that described people, and this time we looked at portraits from the National
      Gallery. The students were asked to make up a personality for the portrait
      they chose. They needed to include physical characteristics, describe the
      person&rsquo;s personal life, and come up with some secrets and wishes
      that character might have by using the clues in the portrait. The content
      standards for these two activities were that a student &ldquo;demonstrates
      increasing proficiency in using appropriate technology to present information
      for the intended audience&rdquo; and a student &ldquo;demonstrates increasing
      proficiency in applying appropriate types of writing.&rdquo;   The more
      specific performance standards include that the student &ldquo;structures
      a written account&rdquo; and &ldquo;composes a variety of written work
      that develops sentence fluency using a variety of multimedia technologies&rdquo; (APS
      Language Arts Standards 7<sup>th</sup> grade).</p>
    <h3>Social Studies</h3>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s examine how we implemented a lesson using a social studies
      standard for grade six. The Benchmark states students will &ldquo;Compare
      and contrast major historical events and figures from ancient civilizations.&rdquo; The
      standard says students &ldquo;describe and compare the characteristics
      of the civilizations of Egypt&hellip;and explain the importance of their
      contributions to later civilizations.&rdquo;(Albuquerque Public Schools
      Social Studies Standards and Benchmarks 6<sup>th</sup> grade)</p>
    <p>Rachel begins by showing a sixth grade social studies teacher a museum
      Web site that she thinks the teacher could use. In this particular case,
      it was the interactive Web site from the British Museum entitled &ldquo;Ancient
      Egypt&rdquo; (www.ancientegypt.co.uk). The teacher felt that he could use
      it, so he created a worksheet that required the students to use the Internet
      to answer the questions. The classes (all seven of them) came to the library
      and Rachel showed them how to get to the Web site and how to navigate it
      - very easy for tech-savvy sixth graders. The students enjoyed the Web
      site because it is diverse and broad enough to hold their interest, and
      over a two-day period every student completed the worksheet.</p>
    <p>What was interesting was that they were content to stay on the Web site
      even when they had finished the worksheet. Most middle school students
      have many other things they like to do on a computer, so it was encouraging
      to see them engaged. To continue the unit on Ancient Egypt, Rachel created
      an assignment where the students had to use the Web site and books in the
      library to track down information about real Egyptian artifacts that she
      had found for sale on the Web. Once again, the students were interested
      enough in the museum Web site that they completed the assignment and stayed
      on task. Both assignments satisfied the previously mentioned social studies
      benchmark and standard.</p>
    <h3>Science</h3>
    <p>A science lesson on habitat could use the virtual Web site (<a href="../http://www.fieldmuseum.org/" target="_blank">http://www.fieldmuseum.org</a>).
      The on-line interactives at the Project ER: Environmental Rescue offer
      wonderful opportunities for students to investigate the inter-relationships
      of the living environment. The Life Science content standard requires students
      to &ldquo;understand the interdependence of living things and their environments.&rdquo;  The
      benchmark asks students to &ldquo;explain the diverse structure and functions
      of living things and the complex relationships between living things and
      their environment&rdquo; (APS Science Benchmarks and Standards).</p>
    <h3>Art and Library</h3>
    <p>In January the art teacher teamed up with Rachel, our librarian, to teach
      a lesson expanding the definition of food in our culture, creating both
      art and library products. The standards for art are &ldquo;to use visual
      arts to express ideas,&rdquo; and &ldquo;explore various media to develop
      and convey ideas through art&rdquo;(APS fine arts standard). The library
      standard is to promote &ldquo;the independent learner&rdquo; and the benchmark
      states that the student &ldquo;designs, develops and evaluates information
      products and solutions related to personal needs.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Besides sharing books about food and culture, Rachel also shared with
      the students paintings of food from the National Gallery in London (<a href="../http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk);</a>old phone message --  a
      great picture of Judy Chicago&rsquo;s masterpiece &ldquo;The Dinner Party&rdquo; (soon
      to be permanently housed at the Brooklyn Museum of Art); and a wonderful
      totally virtual museum entitled &ldquo;The Food Museum&rdquo; actually
      based in Albuquerque, New Mexico (<a href="../http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://</a><a href="../http://www.foodmuseum.com/" target="_blank">www.foodmuseum.com</a>). &ldquo;The
      Food Museum&rdquo; has an exhibit that highlights the food of New Mexico:
      that helped the seventh and eighth grade students appreciate the validity
      of the assignment.</p>
    <h1>Finding Appropriate Web Sites</h1>
    <p>How do average teachers go about finding the Web museum to use in classroom
      instruction?</p>
    <p>There are many available Web sites that design an entire lesson for a
      teacher, complete with standards, activities and evaluations. Teachers
      can also purchase teachers&rsquo; guides for specific books from teacher
      supply stores. However, my experience is that teachers will pick and choose
      what they like and what is useable for their students. Outlines, teaching
      ideas, suggestions, Internet links are all more valuable than trying to
      design a one size fits all lesson. Obviously, when a Web designer prepares
      a site, he cannot make it specific to one grade, one subject, or one standard.
      Standards are designed to spiral through the curricula through all of the
      grades, so often big ideas will recur throughout the entire twelve grades,
      gradually becoming more and more complex. It seems providing structure
      and easy access to information, activities, and collections is the most
      valid way to set up a museum site.</p>
    <p>Teachers generally use the body of a lesson or a teaching unit year after
      year, and once they find a successful lesson, they will use it again and
      again, with modifications. For most subjects the standards do not offer
      much deviation. Language arts and literature are much more open- ended,
      and so teachers can meet the standards by choosing from a wide range of
      literature. But after they have prepared a piece of literature for instruction
      (organized the reading, prepared vocabulary and activities, and constructed
      an evaluation and assessment) and found that it works well with students,
      they do not eagerly add new works. A literature teacher may add or change
      one or two pieces of writing a year, if any. So you can see that museum
      Web sites have a very small portal open into the teacher&rsquo;s curriculum.
      The Web sites must have immediate accessibility and appeal for the teacher
      to even open it up and explore. Currently at McKinley only three teachers
      out of a faculty of 40 have made use of virtual museums through our library.
      These are the three discussed in this paper.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s take a teacher doing Web searches for several award-winning
      books they might want to teach in their middle school language arts class.
      How would the teacher go about finding useful museum Web sites? First,
      using the Albuquerque Public Schools Language Arts Standards, the teacher
      will find the standards she is planning to have her students meet. Cathy
      is considering using two Newberry Award books, <em>A Single Shard </em>by
      Linda Sue Park and <em>The Midwife&rsquo;s Apprentice </em>by Karen Cushman.
      The performance standards that fit these books are the student &ldquo;analyzes
      a variety of text (historical fiction),&rdquo; &ldquo;analyzes problems
      and solutions within various texts,&rdquo; &ldquo;generates further questions,&rdquo; and &ldquo;explains
      the importance of and describes connections between related topics&rdquo; (APS
      7<sup>th</sup> grade language arts standards). Both of these novels are
      set in specific historic time periods and lend themselves well to using
      a virtual museum. Cathy has begun planning her lessons for these novels
      and begins a search for virtual museums and other helpful Web sites. </p>
    <p>An Internet search for Korean pottery yields three useful sites: The Metropolitan
      Museum (<a href="../http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea" target="_blank">http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea)</a>,
      the Asia Society Museum (<a href="../http://www.asiasocietymuseum.com/" target="_blank">http://www.asiasocietymuseum.com</a>)
      and a non-museum site that is very interactive and useful, (<a href="../http://www.koreafolkart.com)/" target="_blank">http://www.koreafolkart.com)</a>.
      After visiting each site she decides there is enough useful information
      in each that she can combine them into a good lesson on Korean Celadon
      pottery. Students can view examples of the pottery and learn more so their
      understanding of Tree-ear, the main character, and his study with the Master
      potter Min is more meaningful.</p>
    <p>She then starts a search on the Middle Ages. After four pages of searching
      on Google, she cannot find one good, child-friendly museum that could be
      used in a classroom. She gives up and chooses other resources to increase
      understanding of the Middle Ages and what life would be like for the main
      character in the book. (Most teachers will quit searching after two pages
      of Google. They will give up rather than waste more time.) Cathy may use
      a projector for the entire classroom or have everyone use a computer to
      search; she may make copies, give students directions and assign the search
      as homework. How she decides to use the Web site is dynamic and flexible.</p>
    <h1>Web Designers and Teachers</h1>
    <p>For the museum Web designer, the teacher is the first hurdle to get past.
      There are two more important factors that will determine the success of
      the museum. The first is how appealing the site is to the user- a kid!
      The second factor is how easily the site can be accessed in a school setting.
      Students are technologically savvy, and they know what they like and they
      know what they don&rsquo;t like. The first thing that will stop the average
      student is large amounts of text and very few graphics. Second, too many
      steps (links) to get where they want to go will distract them. So a good
      user- friendly site for a student has to be simply stated with clear instructions,
      and it must take the student directly to where he wants to look and it
      must have an interactive element. If there is an activity for the student
      to &lsquo;play,&rsquo; the instructions must almost be self-explanatory
      or have only minimal directions and the student must be able to successfully
      use the game. </p>
    <p>School computers have limitations in their ability to use complex programs.
      While searching for a site, Cathy was asked to install Shockwave before
      she could access the activity. However, the school had blocked Shockwave
      to prevent kids from going to games. So the instructional games she wished
      to use were not available to her no matter how well designed they were.
      One solution to this is to offer the activity in an easy to access format
      and again with the Shockwave added as another option. Another site required
      Adobe Reader to be downloaded. Again, in a computer lab setting this was
      not available. Even with high speed Internet, many students at once on
      computers slow our computers down. We are connected to a district wide
      server so at certain times of the day the computers may be especially slow
      due to high use. Big programs can also be very slow to access. Because
      school computers vary widely in how they are administered and what they
      provide, the guideline &ldquo;the simpler the better&rdquo; applies. If
      a Web site is simple and easy to access, easy to use, and requires no extra
      installations, there is a greater likelihood that it will be used in a
      classroom setting.</p>
    <p>Why do virtual museum Web designers need students and teachers? We are
      your audience. These pre-visits get our children, future adults, into the
      habit of visiting museums to find general information such as times, prices,
      on-line stores and so on. More important, they turn museums into living
      textbooks. They are the fluid repositories of knowledge. They are the digital
      heritage of mankind. The museums have the expertise, the artifacts and
      the support of public monies to make their holdings available to anyone.</p>
    <p>We hope our students will return to the museum on their own.</p>
    <p> The school librarian can be the school&rsquo;s gatekeeper to the best
      and most interactive of the virtual museum Web sites. The librarian searches,
      introduces, and expands on lessons to facilitate the classroom teachers&rsquo; lessons.
      The librarian can help teachers and students with navigation of museum
      Web sites, assist by lecturing before the virtual museum is visited, and
      make connections with additional resources - books and other holdings that
      are available system wide.</p>
    <p>What might our school&rsquo;s future use of museum Web sites look like?
      We would love to see virtual museums offer increased use of video and audio
      features. We would also like more chances for interaction with curators
      or experts through questions and real time or e-mail answers. Live cams
      and more on-line uses for students who may have opportunities for streaming
      video or podcasting in their homes would provide incentives for teachers
      and students. Other types of interactive, open communication could include
      on-line discussion groups between the museum and even other participating
      schools, blogs, facilities to post our students&rsquo; observations, comments,
      stories, images and other collaborative activities. We would love to see
      portals that make outreach for teachers to these types of projects easy
      to negotiate, participate in and manage. The on-line collaborative museum
      projects described in Nadia Arbach&rsquo;s article (see reference) have
      potential for our middle school students, but we need an &lsquo;invitation&rsquo; from
      museums. We need to see postings from museums inviting interested participants
      (teachers and students) to check out the available collaboratives to see
      if they fit into our curricula.</p>
    <p>It is a slow process for public schools to update their technologies as
      they depend on local and state funding: bond issues, mill levies, and state
      appropriations. Sometimes it can take years from the time the funding is
      approved to the actual implementation in the school. So realistically,
      schools are always behind in their technology. However, the possibilities
      are exciting even with the existing state of our hard and software. Museums
      have much to offer us.</p>
    <p>As we prepare our students for literacy in the 21<sup>st</sup> century,
      students will need basic language literacy that includes on-line reading
      strategies, visual literacy, historical literacy, cultural literacy, information
      literacy, political literacy, news media literacy, scientific literacy,
      and mathematical literacy. (noodletools.com). It is easy to see from this
      comprehensive list that there are many of these kinds of literacy where
      virtual museums can make major contributions in helping teachers to develop
      and share competency in each of them. </p>
    <p>In his article &ldquo;In Search of the Ubiquitous Museum,&rdquo; Kevin
      Sumption talks about electronic field trips. In his words, &ldquo;when
      switched on, future ubiquitous museums should be able to function as comprehensive
      archives of material culture, capable of operating in all places at all
      times.&rdquo; (Museums and the Web 2006). The Web museum gives added value
      to classroom learning by actually showing the students that there is a
      reason for what they are learning, by showing them the connection to the
      real world. The virtual museum effectively uses the power of the digital
      world by blending the past with present and future technologies and brings
      the collected knowledge of the world to our digital fingertips. We can
      allow our students to wonder about and wander through the many museums
      of the world.</p>
