				<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
				<p class="abstract">The development and use of the Web by science-technology
				  museums, mass media, and other informal science learning resource centers
				  to enable remote public access to their resources and expand their educational
				  outreach programs has grown enormously over the past decade. Similarly,
				  many
				  &quot;open source&quot; learning and education portals are rapidly growing
				  into major free global lifelong learning resources.  At the same time,
				  U.S. student achievement in science in middle and high schools continues
				  to be lag far behind that of students in many developed countries, and
				  many American K-8 science teachers still lack B.A. degrees in science or
				  adequate ongoing professional development in both science content and pedagogy.
				  A huge and growing gap thus exists between the vast, freely available wealth
				  of museum and other informal science Web learning resources and teachers' integral
				  use of these rich resources to improve students' science learning
				  and achievement. </p>
				<p class="abstract">The Bay Area Science Museum and Education Collaboratory
				  has been designed to help bridge this gap.  The design rationale,
				  methodology, web architectural components, and teacher professional development
				  and support model of the Bay Area Collaboratory are briefly outlined, as
				  well as a summary of formative evaluation results over the past five years.  The
				  potential of expanding this web-based regional museum education and teacher
				  professional development collaboratory model to other geographic areas,
				  as well as to other kinds of museums and curricular content, is also explored.</p>

    <h2>Introduction: The Science Learning and Achievement Gap</h2>
    <p class="BlockQuote">&quot;At the daybreak of this new century and millennium,
      we are convinced that the future well-being of our nation and people depends
    not just on how well we educate our children generally, but on how well we
    educate them in mathematics and science specifically.&quot;&ndash;<em>Before
    It's Too Late</em>, The Glenn Commission (National Commission on Mathematics
    and Science Teaching for the 21st Century, 2000).</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">&quot;No one ever failed 'museum'&quot;&ndash;<em>Frank Oppenheimer (1912-1985),
      Founding Director of the Exploratorium, San Francisco</em></p>
  <p>Museums all over the world are increasingly using the
    Web and the Internet to enable remote public access to their resources and
    to expand the variety, frequency and quality of their educational outreach
    programs. For example in its second national survey of museum-school relationships,
    True Needs, True Partners (IMLS, 2002), the federal Institute of Museum and
    Library Services found that the over 15,000 museums in the U.S. alone now
    commit more than a billion dollars and more than 18 million instructional
    hours annually to K-12 educational programs.  Furthermore, more than 70%
    of the museums surveyed provide access to their web sites for learning and
    teaching resources for teachers, students and parents.  The percentage of
    science-technology museums, aquariums, zoos, and other informal science learning
    centers, as well as university, foundation and government-sponsored science
    and medical research centers and   professional development organizations
    for science teachers (e.g., NASA, NSTA, PBS) that provide web access and
    Internet-based exchanges with their members and communities is even higher.   In
    the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the  Web, now joined with podcasting, digital
    video, blogs and wikis,   has clearly become a major global resource for
    building of lifelong learning communities (Kahn,, 1999; Kahn &amp; Rockman,
    2002, 2003; Kahn, et al., 2004; Craney, et al./ HHMI, 2005; Kahn, 2005).  </p>
  <p>Over the past 40 years, the aggregated investment by the
    National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), NASA,
    Department of Energy, U.S. Department of Education, and other government
    programs, foundations and private donors to science-technology museums, PBS/NPR
    TV and radio, aquariums, zoos, and other informal science centers and related
    informal science educational programs has been in the billions of dollars.  At
    the same time, U.S. student achievement in science has continued to be lag
    well behind that of students in many developed countries (Lemonick, 2006;
    National Academies, 2006), and the vast majority of U.S. K-8 teachers (including
    middle school science teachers&ndash;and even many high school science teachers)
    still lack even B.A. or M.A. degrees in science or science education (Horizon
    Research, 2002). Furthermore, the federal &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; Act has
    placed increasing accountability pressures on teachers for standards-based
    instruction and to show adequate annual yearly progress in student achievement
    as measured by high stakes, standards-based tests. Despite the free availability
    of billions of dollars of the museum and other informal learning resources
    on the web, the majority of science teachers still doesn't know about or
    make integral use of this wealth of resources in their daily classroom instruction.  Even
    the most experienced teachers seldom have time to search through thousands
    of web pages to find and identify the most exemplary, grade-level appropriate,
    and state content standards-aligned resources that fit their own science
    curricula and instruction, as well their students' learning needs (Kahn &amp; Rockman,
    2002, 2003; Kahn, 2005. </p>
  <h2>One Possible Solution: The Bay Area Science Education Collaboratory</h2>
  <p>Over the past five years, an initial online learning and
    teacher professional development environment for improving science education
    in the San Francisco Bay Area has been designed and built to address these
    issues.  The concept approach that was used was one of co-designing a web-based,
    open source educational &quot;collaboratory&quot; (<a
href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboratory" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboratory</a>)
    with and for use by a regional community of teachers, parents, science and
    museum educators, and students.  Most collaboratories, such as those documented
    by the NSF-funded &quot;Science of Collaboratories Project&quot; (<a
href="../http://www.scienceofcollaboratories.org/" target="_blank">http://www.scienceofcollaboratories.org/</a>),
    have been designed to support geographically distributed communities of science
    or social science researchers sharing and contributing to essential databases
    (e.g., the Human Genome Project) or having shared remote/virtual access to
    and use of unique or rare scientific instruments or facilities (e.g., The
    Hubble Space Telescope, CERN).</p>
  <p>However, the Bay Area Science Museum and Education Collaboratory
    has taken a slightly different approach to its design and use. First, the
    Bay Area Science  Collaboratory has been specifically co-designed with and
    for use by science teachers  to &quot;bridge the gap&quot; between museum and other
    informal science centers and formal science education (Hofstein &amp;
    Rosenfeld, 1996; Hofstein, Bybee, &amp; Legro, 1997; Bybee, 2001; IMLS, 2002;
    Kahn &amp; Rockman, 2002).  The Bay Area Collaboratory  (Kahn &amp; Rockman,
    2003; Kahn, 2005) supports San Francisco Bay Area (as well as other California)
    science teachers and students, parents, museum educators, and other informal
    science providers by collectively helping teachers and other users easily
    find and aggregate the best standards-aligned, web-based learning and teaching
    resources from multiple Bay Area science-technology and children's museums,
    aquariums, zoos, and other &quot;best of the Web&quot; resources for use in formal
    science education in the classroom.  The initial target audience for the
    Collaboratory has been San Francisco Bay Area middle grades science teachers
    (grades 4-8).  This focus was catalyzed by extremely low levels of California
    student performance in science at the 5<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grade
    levels on the National Assessment of Educational Progress in 2000.</p>

  <h2>Standards and Accountability: The Impact of No Child Left Behind</h2>
  <p>The creation of national education science standards during
    the 1990's (National Research  Council, 1996, AAAS, 1993) was followed by
    the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001. This major federal legislation
    has refocused schools and teachers' accountability to be very highly based
    on instruction that is based on state content standards, with annual student
    achievement testing with increasingly &quot;high stakes&quot; for showing higher levels
    of student achievement and annual improvement.   For example, the  California
    Department of Education's STAR testing program  now administers annual  California
    standards-based science tests to all students in grades 5, 
    8 and 10 (as mandated by No Child Left Behind), and these test results are
    factored into each school's Academic Performance Index (API).   Failure to
    meet adequate Annual Yearly Progress (AYP) goals on these tests, as well
    as those in mathematics, reading and language arts, can have serious consequences
    for school funding and independence of individual teacher choices about classroom
    instruction.  In the most extreme cases,  a school's independence of curricular
    choices or even its continued existence, can be sacrificed if its API is
    not sufficiently high or its AYP goals are not met.</p>
  <p>While teachers and student field trip groups are a major
    audience for science museums, none of these museums were  designed around
    these national or state curriculum standards.  However, because American
    students'
    achievement in science now lags far behind that of students in many other
    developed countries and because there is national concern over the  decreasing
    number of American students pursuing undergraduate and graduate study in
    science, technology and engineering fields (as compared to major increases
    in 
    India, China, Korea, and other countries), a number of  leading science educators
    have argued that museums should make strong efforts to show how their exhibits
    and other educational resources can complement and supplement the national
    science education standards (e.g., Bybee, 2001).  The second IMLS
    &quot;True Needs, True Partners&quot; survey of museum-school partnerships also documented
    that the vast majority of museums now either have staff or have hired consultants
    dedicated to showing teachers and educators the alignment and connections
    between the museums'  exhibits and programs with state curriculum standards
    (IMLS, 2002).</p>
  <p>The Bay Area Science Collaboratory was thus designed to
    provide a &quot;light switch easy&quot; visual Web interface to link the
    wealth of over $1 billion invested in multiple Bay Area science-technology
    museums and other informal science centers with California's state science
    curriculum standards (California Board of Education, <a
href="../http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/scmain.asp" target="_blank">http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/scmain.asp</a>).
    In our initial phase of Collaboratory design, we discovered that each museum
    has its own way of presenting its learning and teaching resources and assets
    on the Web, and there is no one standard interface or way of finding the
    answer to a typical teacher's question: What resources do you have that are
    appropriate for sixth grade and that directly address these California science
    content standards about plate tectonics?</p>
  <p>Some might ask,
    &quot;Why can't teachers just use Google, Yahoo or other search engines to find
    these resources?&quot;  The simple answer is:  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>most teachers lack the time
      for doing such searches; </li>
    <li>the information overload factor has now become
      overwhelming (For example, in 2002, a Google search on the terms &quot;middle
      school plate tectonics&quot; resulted in over 17,000 hits; the same search
      performed in early 2007 now results in over 330,000 hits!) and </li>
    <li>Web searches cannot easily determine grade level appropriateness of
      the resources, pedagogical fit with the curriculum, or effectiveness of
      these resources in addressing different scientific content or processes
      of inquiry and experimentation. However, these are exactly the kinds of
      knowledge that museum staffs have, especially those who have work directly
      with teachers for many years, but this kind of &quot;pedagogical/standards
      metadata&quot; is
      rarely included with web resources of most science museums.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Collaboratory is one of a growing number of &quot;open
    source&quot; web-based collaborations to co-design and use community aggregated,
    created and modified educational resources that are changing the landscape
    of web-based lifelong learning (Tapscott &amp; Williams, 2006).  In this
    way, it is both a growing shared &quot;community knowledge and learning garden&quot; for
    science education, as well as an ongoing professional development experience
    in both science content and &quot;best practices&quot; in science pedagogy for its
    participants. 
    The Bay Area Collaboratory is based on a highly collaborative action research
    and participatory design model, in which teachers have both been central
    members of the design team, as well as its users, contributors and advocates,
    informal trainers and coaches for other teachers.  It also represents an
    alternative professional development model in science education at a time
    when fewer than 45% of Bay Area middle school science teachers (and even
    fewer elementary teachers) have academic degrees or adequate formal backgrounds
    in science.</p>
  <p>Initial needs assessment
      and potential stakeholder analysis research in 2001-2002 (funded by the
      Hewlett Foundation) identified a wealth of existing exhibits, lesson plans, &quot;recipes&quot;
    for hands-on demos/activities, and web-based educational outreach activities
    in Bay Area science-technology and youth museums, aquariums, zoos, and nature
    parks. However, we also found that these resources are still highly under-utilized
    by the majority of teachers in the Bay Area&ndash;and especially those in middle
    schools in large urban districts and even less in underserved communities. </p>
  <p>A summary of our findings
      from our initial needs assessment research in 2001-02, as well as the formative
      evaluation during our first two years of development, is as follows:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li> Bay Area elementary and middle school teachers, especially
	      those in the elementary grades, are generally aware of and have occasionally
	      visited at least some of the many museums and informal science centers
	      in the Bay Area. </li>
	    <li> However, most teachers are not aware of the diverse
	      kinds of science learning and teaching resources available from these
	      museums, especially now that these are available on the museum Web sites.</li>
	    <li> Until recently, few of these museums provided easy ways
	      for teachers to find grade level appropriate, standards-aligned resources,
	      either on the museum exhibit floor or via their web sites.  Since few
	      teachers have the time to seek out and make decisions about which of these
	      resources they can most easily use in their classrooms, much of the major
	      wealth of informal learning and teaching assets remain unused except by
	      the most experienced science teachers. </li>
      </ul>
	  <p> These findings have also since been verified by many other participating
      teachers, as well.</p>
	  <h2>What is a Science Education
        Collaboratory?</h2>
      <p class="caption"><img src="kahn.fig2.thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Bay Area Science Education Collaboratory 6th Grade Home Page" width="400" height="276" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 2: Bay Area Science Education Collaboratory
    6<sup>th</sup> Grade Home Page<br />
    Copyright &copy; 2003, 2006 by DesignWorlds
    for Learning, Inc.<br />
    <a
href="../http://www.designworlds.com/collab/collab-6th/" target="_blank">http://www.designworlds.com/collab/collab-6th/</a></p>
  <p>Here's a typical example
      of the rationale and need for the Collaboratory: Suppose you are (or are
      working with) a San Francisco Bay Area 6th grade science teacher or you
      are a parent of a 6<sup>th</sup> grader.   California's 6<sup>th</sup> grade
      science standards emphasize earth sciences (<a href="../http://www.nexist.org/hf/Standards" target="_blank">http://www.nexist.org/hf/Standards</a> and <a
href="../http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/scgrade6.asp" target="_blank">http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/scgrade6.asp</a>).
      We've already seen that just doing a typical web search produces far too
      many hits to be useful to most teachers. For specific museums, some of
      them have search engines that can ameliorate this situation, but many of
      the best resources available in these museums may still not be found this
      way (Note: The best solution is to personally know a museum staff member
      or a teacher who was been part of an ongoing teacher fellow or teacher
      institute program at a museum, but there are very few such teachers available
      on demand!). Constraining this search further may cut down the total number
      of hits, but almost no middle school teacher has the time to even search
      through more than one or two pages of these hits to find those that are
      most appropriate to teaching needs.</p>
  <p>The Collaboratory was designed
      to help address just these needs.  It has been designed as more of a
    &quot;community knowledge/learning garden&quot; than a portal.   By this, we means
    that it needs to be seeded, tended and nurtured, harvested and &quot;weeded&quot; by
    a community of users in order to be healthy and to continue to serve the
    needs of the middle grades science teaching community.</p>
  <p>Using the community garden
      metaphor, the Collaboratory consists of four major parts or components:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Seeds</strong></p>
  <p> The seeds of the Collaboratory come from multiple Bay Area science museums,
      zoos, aquariums, and science research centers with web resources, as well
      as other informal science learning centers.  Each museum tends to have
      its own pedagogical framework, as well as a particular focus for its educational
      goals and programs. </p>
  <p>The Exploratorium
      in San Francisco (<a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/">http://www.exploratorium.edu</a>)
      is one of the oldest, largest and best-known
    &quot;hands-on&quot; science museums, with a strong focus on inquiry-based
    learning, especially for elementary school students.</p>
  <p>The Tech
      Museum of San Jose (<a href="../http://www.thetech.org/">http://www.thetech.org</a>),
      which also has many hands-on and interactive exhibits, focuses much more
      on how technology is designed to utilize scientific principles to solve
      problems or give birth to whole new areas of business, industry and research.  </p>
  <p>The University of Caliornia's
      U.C.  Museum of Paleontology (<a href="../http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/">http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu</a>) is a relatively small museum on the Berkeley campus
      and thus, it was not designed for major physical public access or visits;
      rather, it is one of the university's natural history research museums.
      However, UCMP was one of the first museums in the world to develop a web
      site and its web site now houses both an extensive portal for paleontology,
      as well as one of the most extensive sets of resources about evolution
      and science in the U.S.  (<a href="../http://evolution.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">http://evolution.berkeley.edu</a>).
     </p>
  <p>Similarly, Chabot Space
      and Science Center (<a href="../http://www.chabotspace.org/" target="_blank">http://www.chabotspace.org</a>)
      in Oakland has a focus on observation of objects that may be light years
      away from Earth, as well as timescales that can be in the millions or billions
      of years; hence, its pedagogical focus is more on observation of patterns
      and evidence from other worlds, coupled with similar observations on Earth,
      to help us understand our place in the Milky Way Galaxy &ndash; how were
      the Earth and Solar System born, where else might there be life or planets
      quite similar to Earth, and what  the relationship is between astronomy,
      physics, biology and cosmology (and cosmic evolution)?  </p>
  <p>The Lawrence Hall of Science
      at the University of California, Berkeley  (<a
href="../http://www.lhs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">http://www.lhs.berkeley.edu</a>)
      not only has many hands-on exhibits, but is has been the home of research,
      development and creation of many of the nation's major science and mathematics
      curriculum reform projects for nearly 40 years (e.g., 
    SCIS, OBIS, HAP, EQUALS, Family Math, GEMS, FOSS, CHEM, SEPUP and many others). </p>
  <p>Finally, the Children's
      Discovery Museum of San Jose (<a href="../http://www.cdm.org/" target="_blank">http://www.cdm.org</a>)
      serves primarily younger students than those of our Collaboratory focus,
      but its BioSITE project is a major educational outreach program which is
      directly relevant to middle grades environmental science and education
      (<a href="../http://www.cdm.org/biosite/">http://www.cdm.org/biosite/</a>).</p>
 
 <p><strong> 2. Soil</strong></p>
 <p>  The CA state science standards are the &quot;soil&quot; into which the science content &quot;seeds&quot; from
      different museums need to be planted so they can grow into learning resources
      teachers can harvest.  Figure 2 above shows a visual interface to the CA
      6<sup>th</sup> grade science content standards (with thanks to the visual creativity of Eileen Clegg, <a href="../http://www.visualinsight.net/">http://www.visualinsight.net</a>).  Each standard is subdivided into subtopics or specific &quot;benchmarks&quot; which
      are designed to indicate how much students have learned, all tied to grade-level
      appropriate standards.   For example, we might pick 6<sup>th</sup> Grade
      Standard #1, Plate Tectonics, from the Collaboratory's 6<sup>th</sup> Grade
      Home Page (Figure 2 above). This would take us to the web page where all
      the subtopics and benchmarks for this standard are linked to different
      kinds of museum web-based learning and teaching assets:</p>

  <p><strong>3. Harvesting
        Educational Fruits and Vegetables</strong></p> 
  The Collaboratory has several
        different kinds of resources that can be used by teachers, parents, and
        students depending on needs and curricular focus.  These are shown as
        the buttons on the left side of each Collaboratory screen, and the gray
        buttons turn green once a user selects a specific subtopic and there
        have been resources found (and shared) by other teachers for any given
        resource type, as follows:<p></p>
 <ul>
  <li><strong>Lesson
    and Unit Plans</strong>:  These are the basis for most classroom teachers' work in
    schools.  Many museums now provide a variety of lesson plans that address
    topics that are either drawn from exhibits on the floor of the museum or
    from themes and pedagogical focus of the museum as a whole. 
    Teacher-designed, contributed and rated lesson plans are being created at
    our next level of Collaboratory development.</li>
  <li><strong>Hands-on
    Demos and Activities</strong>:  Most science and children's museums have a number
    of interactive exhibits that are the main draw for attending these museums.  However,
    mini-versions of many of these exhibits or demonstrations may be created
    by teachers (or by students at home) if they are given sufficient guided
    instructions.  For example, the Exploratorium has what it calls &quot;Snacks&quot; that
    are very low-cost hands-on experiments or demos that can be done by both
    teachers and parents (<a
href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/" target="_blank">http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Homework</strong>: 
    These are web and other resources for independent student exploration of
          a topic addressed in class, as well as &quot;family learning&quot; opportunities
          that make use of museum resources in conjunction with classroom curriculum.</li>
  <li><strong>Projects</strong>:  These
      can range from very short-term experiments and investigations (e.g., &quot;kitchen
      science&quot;) to longer-term science fair projects, which require independent
      student research, and investigations (see, for example, A Schmahl Science
      Workshop <a
href="../http://www.schmahlscience.org/" target="_blank">http://www.schmahlscience.org</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Field
      Trips and Virtual Tours</strong>: 
    When classes can actually go to a museum for a field trip, the Collaboratory
    allows teachers to find and share pre-visit planning guides, resources for
    the actual museum field trip and post-visit follow-up and reflection, all
    aligned with one or more science curriculum standards for their grade level.  The
    now common use of museum webcasting  (first pioneered in the Bay Area by
    the Exploratorium in the 1990's) has become a major outreach vehicle for
    many museums and other science centers. The growth of lower cost, easy-to-use
    digital video cameras and video sharing sites, such as YouTube (<a
href="../http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com</a>) and Google Video (<a
href="../http://video.google.com/" target="_blank">http://video.google.com</a>), now enable sharing
    of some of students and teachers interactions with exhibits so that others
    can see these virtually. Similarly, video podcasts can and will become common
    portable virtual museum field trips, as well as visitor orientation guides. </li>
  <li><strong>Assessment</strong>:  This
      is an area needing considerable development and collaboration with the
      museums over the coming years.   Annual assessment of science learning
      and achievement is now typically limited to student performance on standardized
      multiple-choice tests, which tend to favor memory of facts over assessment
      of deeper understanding of scientific concepts, scientific thinking and
      applied scientific literacy.  We are confident that over time, new and
      much better methods of diagnosing and assessing students' understanding
      of science will emerge, and museums may well become one of the major sources
      of new ways of assessing both informal and formal science learning.</li>
  <li>&quot;<strong>Best
      of the Web&quot; Resources</strong>:  In addition to museums, there are, of course, many
      local, national and international institutions and other sources of exemplary
      science learning available on the Web for different grade levels.  For
      example, NASA Ames Research Center and the USGS are both outstanding sources
      of science content, both are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, yet
      neither is a museum, per se.   While we encourage teachers to first look
      for resources from the local museums, this category enables teachers to
      find, share and use any other resource on the Web that's appropriate to
      their needs.</li>
	  </ul>
  <p><strong>4. Irrigation and Weeding: Nexist Wiki Topic/Subject
      Maps and Standards Matrix/Database </strong></p>
  A major part of the benefit of both
      the technical and social architecture of the Collaboratory is in the connecting
      of different concepts, museum resources, and curriculum standards and pedagogical
      practice of a growing teacher-user community.  The Bay Area Collaboratory
      has been fortunate to be able to use an open source wiki environment, called
      Nexist Wiki, developed by Jack Park, an expert in developing web-based
      topic and subject maps (Park &amp; Hunting, 2002 <a
href="../http://www.thinkalong.com/Nexist/" target="_blank">http://www.thinkalong.com/Nexist/</a> and <a href="../http://www.nexist.org/dev/" target="_blank">http://www.nexist.org/dev/</a>)&ndash; soon
      to be merged and upgraded with his new TopicSpaces.   The importance of
      web-based subject and topic maps is that will provide the connection between
      and hierarchy of concepts and topics that are not at all clear to teachers
      in the way that state curriculum standards are now listed.  This area has
      been very well developed by AAAS Project 2061 in its Atlas of Science Literacy
      (AAAS
    &amp; NSTA, 2003), but it is currently not available in electronic form.
    <p>Figure 5 shows  one screen and link to one of the many
      Collaboratory 6<sup>th</sup> grade topic/subject map web pages, showing
      links with other topics within this space:</p>

  <p>The other critical part of this space is the MySQL
      database and wiki Standards Matrix where all new resources found by teachers
      and other community members are stored.  Anyone who wants to go beyond
      the two most popular (highly voted) resources shown on the Collaboratory's
      main pages for any standard, subtopic and grade level may search through
      this space and protected password access is given to those actively participating
      teachers who are contributing new resources to the Collaboratory.  Below

  <h2>Early Evaluation Findings</h2>
  <p><strong>First
    Year Evaluation.</strong>  An external formative evaluation was conducted after the
    first year, based on in-depth interviews and questionnaires that were administered
    to the participating teachers.  This evaluation found that the participating
    teachers were very diverse with respect to their teaching experience, science
    background, and experience with Bay Area science museums and online resources.
    All teachers increased their use of web-based resources in their classrooms
    especially web sites they had heard about at the workshops. Teachers began
    sharing information about web-based resources with other teachers in their
    schools and with each other. The major constraints in using web-based resources
    were related to time.  Yet, teachers felt that the project's work has a great
    potential to save their time by helping them find the resources they need.  The
    teachers' level of satisfaction with the web site also increased over the
    course of the project as the web site was modified to meet their needs.  Finally,
    the teachers improved their knowledge of science content and science pedagogy
    (Kahn and Rockman, 2003).</p>
  <p><strong>Second Year
    Evaluation.</strong> This evaluation, similar in design to the first, found
    that as teachers became convinced that the time they spent using Collaboratory
    resources saved them time in the long run, they were more likely to be
    willing to invest that time up-front. Participating in the Collaboratory
    increased these teachers' knowledge of Bay Area informal science resources,
    science content and processes and, the California sixth grade science standards.
    Teachers with the lowest level of content knowledge learned the most. The
    evaluation also found that focusing the Collaboratory resources on the
    standards teachers are required to teach was an increasingly important
    feature of the environment, from the perspective of the teachers. The teachers
    also reported a wide variation in the quantity of material available for
    the various standards, but not in the quality.   </p>
  <p>The following quotes express
      two middle school teachers' enthusiastic experience in both being part
      of the Collaboratory co-design team, as well users of the Collaboratory's
      science learning resources they and their teacher colleagues found from
      the different museums:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">&quot;This experience feels wonderful. I feel very privileged
    to have access to it. I love it! Thank you to all who made this possible.&quot; </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">&quot;Bay Area Science Education Collaboratory ... AWESOME!!!!!
    (to say the least)&quot;</p>
  <h2>Outcomes: How do we define success for the Collaboratory?</h2>
  <p>Ultimately, the
      success of the Collaboratory involves the alignment of all the key stakeholders&ndash;learners,
      providers (in this case, the museums), payers, and policy-makers&ndash;in terms
      of engaged student learning and achievement in science. In our next phase
      of Collaboratory development, this translates into the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> <strong>Student
          Success</strong> is 10-15% improvement in student academic performance in
          science (more knowledge and demonstrated performance in the same time,
          or the same knowledge and performance in less time) determined by state,
          national and international standardized tests or other accepted measures,
          and by the portfolio of qualitative and quantitative assessment instruments
          that are available or designed for the assessment feature on the Collaboratory
          web site.  In 5<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grades, this can now
          be measured using the California Standards Tests (CST) in science.  Student
          success also includes effective communication of science concepts in
          writing, multimedia presentations, and in other forms, not only in
          science classes, but also in integrating critical analysis, science-related-issues,
          inquiry and other science concepts in areas such as language arts,
          social studies, and problem-solving applications in mathematics.  Student
          Success is also characterized by improved and sustained
          student interest and engagement in science and science-related activities.
          Following use of the the Collaboratory, teachers, parents and others
          should observe students asking more questions, reading more science-related
          content, engaging in conversation or writing in which science is included,
          doing science-related projects (e.g., science fairs), and expressing
          interest in going to science museums or participating in other science-related
          activities.</li>
  <li><strong>Teacher
          Success</strong> is shown by positive and enthusiastic input from teachers
          saying the Collaboratory helped them help their students be even more
          successful learning science by using supporting quantitative AND qualitative
          assessment examples. It is also shown by enthusiastic teachers saying
          that their own knowledge of the science they are teaching has improved,
          and that their classroom preparation time is used much more effectively
          because of the Collaboratory.</li>
  <li> <strong>Parental
          Success </strong>is shown by positive
          feedback from parents, guardians, or mentors about HOW the Collaboratory
          helped them help their children/learners be even more successful learning
          science. Homework, science projects, discussions of science news
          events and national/international science-related issues, and museum
          visits are all areas in which parents can easily interact with their
          child in exactly the appropriate part of the curriculum. During these
          interactions, the learner and the parent can feel comfortable that
          the activities being supported by the parent are directly useful to
          the learner.</li>
  <li> <strong>Community
          Success</strong> is ultimately shown by an increase in scientific literacy
          and science awareness, including:  (1) getting students to continue
          taking science-related classes, above and beyond those which are required
          to graduate; (2) an increased desire of the science and science education
          community to appreciate the value and validity of science enterprises
          and to ensure continued support of them; and (3) desire and demonstrated
          behavior (of the social science community, in particular) to increase
          desire for and active, direct public participation in the decision-making
          process on societal issues having a science-related basis</li>
	  </ul>
  <h2><strong>Assessment: How do we know
        that we have been successful?</strong></h2>
  <p>The items above are all measurable conditions.  Our
    plan is to involve our external evaluator in designing instruments and collecting
    data to capture the information needed to understand the level of success
    reached by the Collaboratory.  While some of the proposed outcomes are longer
    term and cannot be captured in the brief time of the proposed effort, indicators
    of some of these goals will be assessed.   </p>
  <p>For each of the grade-level initiatives, we will establish
    the baseline or a range for measures that include both academic achievement
    and teacher performance.  The data will be collected from the classrooms
    of participating teachers and, where possible, from classrooms of teachers
    in the same schools not participating in the project.  At the end of each
    semester, a second data collection process will capture outcome data that
    can be related to levels of use of the Collaboratory materials.  Post measures
    will also look at teacher and parent success indicators.</p>
  <p> Among the specific issues to be explored in the evaluation
    are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> <strong>Level
      of teacher participation</strong> (How much is the Collaboratory web site used,
      and do teachers remain active participants throughout the project? (i.e.,
      level of attrition, levels of contribution.))</li>
  <li> <strong>Amount
      and quality of implementation </strong>(use of Collaboratory and the nature
      of the lessons implemented by participating teachers)</li>
  <li> <strong>Impact
      on curriculum and pedagogy </strong>(Does the Collaboratory change the content
      in the classrooms by supplementing or supplanting existing resources and
      how does the instructional process change when these resources are available.)</li>
  <li><strong>Impact
      on student learning/achievement and engagement/interest </strong>(can include
      standardized tests in science (depending on what is being applied in the
      classrooms), participation in and quality of student science projects (as
      evaluated by peers, other faculty and external judges), use of scientific
      language and the ability to communicate science concepts, and other indicators
      of student knowledge of science concepts developed from Collaboratory materials. </li>
  <li> <strong>Parent
      participation in children's science education </strong>(Do they attend museums
      or discuss science-related exhibits/media shows with their children? Support
      science fair participation?)</li>
	  </ul>
  <p>The evaluation feedback will contribute to further knowledge
    about the elements in the Collaboratory and can help refine the aspects of
    the Collaboratory development process that work well and those that don't,
    as well as the strategies for its implementation that lead to success with
    underserved students.  In addition, the evaluation will portray the levels
    of academic success reached by the project by comparing baseline data with
    outcome measures and will inform the interpretation by the recommendations
    made by the people who now have the wisdom of practice (students, teachers
    and parents).  The academic outcome measures will include standardized measures
    administered by the state, district, and school, as well as national and
    international measures administered by assessment programs.  There are also
    likely to be teacher-made assessments developed by the design team and by
    individual teachers who are participating in the project. </p>
  <h2>Future Plans and Prospects</h2>
  <p>The Bay Area Science Education Collaboratory now has all
    the graphical interfaces and databases for all California science curriculum
    content standards in grades 4-6 and will soon have completed those for 7<sup>th</sup> and
    8<sup>th</sup> grade. Over 100 Bay Area K-12 science teachers, museum and
    science educators, and even community college faculty have used and contributed
    to its hundreds of resources over the past 4-5 years. </p>
  <p>Like many collaborative open source web-based projects
    (e.g., Tapscott &amp; Williams, 2006), the growth and success of this resource
    will depends on reaching a critical mass of active teacher and parent users,
    with demonstrated results and outcomes showing improvement in student science
    learning and interest, as well as standards-based science achievement. For
    the Collaboratory to also function as a central resource for a teacher professional
    development community, it will also need to support teachers in developing
    stages of need and level of activity. We see the following as the key stages
    of support:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> Users
    of existing Collaboratory content (&quot;Consumers&quot;)</li>
  <li> Contributors
    of content resources and lesson plans</li>
  <li> Editors
    (of content or specific grade level standards, such as
    &quot;Investigation and Experimentation&quot;)</li>
  <li> Mentors/coaches
    for support of other teachers </li>
  <li> Community
    advocates, builders and &quot;evangelist&quot; for recruiting other teachers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our next plans involve the &quot;seeding&quot; of the 7<sup>th</sup> and
    8<sup>th</sup> grade content of the Collaboratory, as well as a major field
    test and evaluation of the use of this resource to complement, supplement,
    or even replace current textbook-based science instruction taking place in
    many Bay Area elementary and middle schools.   We are actively looking into
    collaborating with a number of open source education initiatives (many funded
    by grants from the Hewlett Foundation), and we are currently exploring how
    this resource might help bootstrap creation of content for open source science
    textbooks and other open source digital media/interactive learning in science
    in middle grades and high school.</p>
  <p>Because the vast majority of the over 15,000 museums in the
    U.S. are not just science-technology museums, we feel this same model of
    a participatory design and practitioner community, committed to finding and
    using the wealth of other museum and informal learning resources for improving
    formal education, has great potential, especially in helping museums better
    communicate how their assets can be mapped and aligned with state curriculum
    standards. For example, a majority of the museums are visual arts and history
    museums, and the IMLS has funded several of these museums to find ways to
    co-create curriculum units with teachers that are aligned with national (or
    state) standards.  Museums' co-development of new, easy to use content authoring
    and publishing tools, such as the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and
    the NMC: New Media Consortium's Pachyderm 2.0 open source authoring system
    (<a
href="../http://www.pachyderm.org/" target="_blank">http://www.pachyderm.org</a>)
    will enable the creation of media-rich interactive lesson plans that can
    then be easily organized and aligned with curriculum standards for teachers,
    especially for art and history, but also, potentially for science and other
    content areas, as well.  </p>
  <p>Finally, because many areas of the U.S. (and other countries
    in the world) have their own multiple museums with rich learning and teaching
    resources on the web, we very much look forward to working with other communities
    in helping create new community open source Museum and Informal Learning
    Collaboratories to help teachers, parents, museum staffs and others be even
    more successful in helping students be engaged and successful learners in
    this age of global, free access to the world's wealth of educational resources.</p>
