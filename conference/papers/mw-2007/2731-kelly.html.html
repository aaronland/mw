				  <h3>Abstract</h3>
				  <p class="abstractText">The
				      importance of open standards in the development of widely accessible
				      and interoperable services in the cultural heritage sector is generally
				      accepted. It might, therefore, be reasonable to assume that use of
				      open standards should be mandatory in the development of networked
				      services. However, experience has shown that the use of open standards
				      is not always straightforward and that open standards do not always
				      succeed in gaining acceptance in the market place.</p>
				  <p class="abstractText">This
				      should not mean an abandonment of a commitment to seek to exploit the
				      benefits of open standards. Rather, there is a need to be honest about
				      possible limitations and to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility
				      within the approaches taken in development work to accommodate limitations
				      and deficiencies. </p>
				  <p class="abstractText">This
				      paper outlines a contextual model for the selection and use of open
				      standards,&nbsp; developed initially to support JISC&rsquo;s development
				      programmes within the UK higher and further education community. The
				      paper provides background to this work and reviews the current status
				      of the implementation of this approach. Finally, it concludes by describing
				      how this community-based approach to open standards can benefit from
				      a wider acceptance of the contextual model and a collaborative approach
				      both to using existing resources and support materials and to maintaining
				      and developing new resources.</p>

				  <h1>Background</h1>
				  <p >The importance of open standards for those involved
				    in the development of widely accessible and interoperable services in
				    the cultural heritage sector is generally accepted. Open standards are
				    on the whole regarded very positively by public sector organisations.
				    Why, then, isn&rsquo;t use of open standards ubiquitous? </p>
				  <p >It could be argued that the reason is a lack of
				    understanding of the benefits of open standards, or just inertia, with
				    developers continuing to make use of proprietary solutions they have
				    expertise in. Such a belief suggests that greater use of open standards
				    requires a mixture of the carrot (greater promotion of the benefits)
				    and the stick (mandating use of open standards and penalties for non-compliance). </p>
				  <p >In reality, however, the authors feel that there
				    is general understanding of the benefits of open standards in the cultural
				    heritage sector. We also feel that, although there will be occasions
				    when mandating the use of open standards is needed, there are dangers
				    with this approach. Potentially this could result in services being developed
				    which fail to be successfully deployed because the open standards are
				    too costly to deploy, are immature, fail to deliver the services the
				    user community expects, or have become out-dated, due either to developments
				    elsewhere or to changes in user expectations. </p>
				  <p >There have been many examples of IT development
				    projects in the public sector where&nbsp; the costs have escalated and
				    the services have failed to live up to their expectations. An inflexible
				    top-down approach to development methodologies, such as a formal commitment
				    to a set of standards, may be one reason for such problems. There is
				    therefore a need to ensure that sufficient flexibility is provided in
				    the selection and use of open standards to avoid such mistakes being
				    repeated.</p>
				  <h1>Open Standards</h1>
				  <h2>Definition
				        of Open Standards </h2>
				  <p >In a paper on open standards it is important to
				    have a clear definition of the meaning of the term. In practice, however,
				    it can be difficult to reach an agreed definition. Rather than attempting
				    to produce a formal definition, the following list of the characteristics
				    of open standards is given:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>The
				      development of open standards is the responsibility of
				      a trusted neutral organisation.</li>
				    <li>The
				      responsibility for the ongoing maintenance and development
				      of open standards is taken by a trusted neutral organisation.</li>
				    <li>Involvement
				      in the development of open standards is open to all.</li>
				    <li>There
				      are no discriminatory barriers to use of open standards.</li>
				    <li>Access
				      to open standards is available to all, without any financial
				      barriers.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p >However, such characteristics do not necessarily
				    apply to all organisations with a responsibility for open standards.
				    For example, within organisations such as W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium),
				    discussions on areas in which standardisation will occur are decided
				    by member organisations who have paid the required membership fee. Similarly,
				    the initial discussions and agreements on the preferred approaches to&nbsp; standardisation
				    work may be determined by such member organisations. Also, standards
				    produced by organisations such as the BSI (British Standards Institution)
				    are not necessarily available free-of-charge.</p>
				  <h2>Why
				        Use Open Standards?</h2>
				  <p >Open standards are important in the development
				    of networked services for several reasons. They aim to:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Support
				      interoperability:</strong> Interoperability
				      is often critical to those creating digital services. There will
				      be a need to ensure that services and data can be used not only within
				      a correct environment, but also across other digital services and
				      across other application areas. A prime purpose of open standards
				      is to provide such interoperability.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Maximise
				      access:</strong> Cultural
				      heritage services normally seek to maximise access to their
				      resources and services. Ideally, access will not be limited by constraints
				      such as the device used by the end user; their physical
				      location; their location on the network, etc.; or personal factors
				      such as disabilities.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Provide
				      application- and device-independence:</strong> The
				      dangers of lock-in to particular applications or hardware
				      platforms are widely acknowledged.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Ensure
				      architectural integrity:</strong> Unlike
				      proprietary solutions, for which the development and intended
				      usage is likely to be constrained by commercial and competitive factors,
				      open standards which are developed within a wider context
				      can help to ensure architectural integrity across a wide range of scenarios.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Provide
				      long-term access to resources and services:</strong> Long
				      term access to scholarly resources and cultural heritage
				      resources is of particular importance for public sector organisations. </li>
			    </ul>
				  <p >The authors of this paper feel that an understanding
				    of such benefits is widely accepted within the development community.
				    What, therefore, are the barriers to an implementation of a vision based
				    on this approach?</p>
				  <h2>The
				        Complexities of Open Standards</h2>
				  <p >The reality is that despite the widespread acceptance
				    of the importance of open standards and the feeling among some that use
				    of open standards should be mandatory in the development of networked
				    services in practice, many organisations fail to implement open standards
				    in their provision of access to digital resources. This may be due to
				    several factors:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Disagreements
				      Over The Meaning</strong>:
				      There are many complex issues involved when selecting and encouraging
				      use of open standards. First, there are disagreements over the definition
				      of open standards. For example Java, Flash and PDF are considered
				      by some to be open standards, although they are, in fact, owned by
				      Sun, Macromedia and Adobe, respectively, who, despite documenting
				      the formats and perhaps having open processes for the evolution of
				      the formats, still have the rights to change the licence conditions
				      governing their use (perhaps due to changes in the business environment,
				      company takeovers, etc.) Similarly, there are questions regarding
				      the governance of apparent open standards, with the control of RSS
				      1.0 and RSS 2.0 providing an interesting example; this lightweight
				      but powerful syndication format for Web context has a complex history
				      plagued by disagreements over governance and the roadmap for future
				      developments.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Difficulties
				      In Mandating And Enforcing Compliance</strong>:
				      There are also issues with the mandating of open standards.
				      For example: What exactly does &lsquo;must&rsquo; mean? When told you must comply
				      with HTML standards, a developer working on a project might first
				      ask, &lsquo;What if I don&rsquo;t?&rsquo; Then what if nobody does?
				      They might also ask, &lsquo;What if I use PDF instead of HTML?&rsquo; There
				      is a need to clarify the meaning of <strong>must</strong> and
				      for an understandable, realistic and reasonable compliance
				      regime. </li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Failure
				      In The Market Place</strong>:
				      It also needs to be recognised that open standards do not
				      always succeed in gaining acceptance in the market place: they are
				      often regarded as too complex to be deployed, and the user community
				      may be content to use existing closed solutions and reluctant to make
				      the investment needed to make changes to existing working
				      practices. </li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Failure
				      To Satisfy User Needs And Expectations</strong>:
				      There is a danger that a development approach may over-emphasise
				      the importance of open standards to the detriment of the
				      end user and the end user&rsquo;s needs and expectations. It is often
				      tempting to look only at the benefits of open standards for the developer
				      or the provider of a service. We can see the temptation
				      to develop a service based on a rich standard which can address a wide
				      variety of use case scenarios. The danger would be that the end user
				      rejects the service in preference to a simpler one.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>Despite
				      such reservations, in reality many IT development programmes are successful.
				      The success may be based on the deployment of agreed-upon and well-defined
				      open standards. However in other cases, development work may adopt
				      a more pragmatic approach, making use of mature open standards but
				      having a more flexible approach to newer standards when there has been
				      no time to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses and the experiences
				      gained in their use.</p>
				  <h2>Lessons Learnt Through Use
				      Of Open Standards   </h2>
				  <h3>Experiences In The UK</h3>
				  <p >The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) (<a href="../http://www.jisc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/</a>),
				    that provides leadership in the innovative use of Information and Communications
				    Technology to support education and research in the UK, has traditionally
				    based its funding of development programmes around the use of open standards.
				    Technical development for&nbsp; ISC&rsquo;s eLib programme, launched
				    in 1996, was based on a standards document (eLib, 1996). The document
				    formed the basis of a revised standards document produced to support
				    JISC&rsquo;s Distributed National Electronic Resource (DNER) programme
				    (later renamed the JISC Information Environment Standards document (JISC,
				    2001). This work in turn influenced the NOF-digitise Technical Standards
				    document (NOF, 2001)&nbsp; used by the national NOF-digitisation programme
				    which was responsible for digitisation projects across the cultural heritage
				    sector.</p>
				  <p >The authors have been involved in providing technical
				    advice and a support infrastructure for both JISC-funded development
				    programmes and the NOF-digitise programme. We will now review the experience
				    we gained.</p>
				  <h3>Case Study 1: QA Focus Project</h3>
				  <p >Although projects funded by the eLib programme were
				    expected to comply with the eLib standards document, in practice compliance
				    was never formally checked. It was probably sensible at the time (the
				    mid 1990s) to avoid mandating a formal technical architecture and corresponding
				    open standards &ndash; that could easily had led to mandating use of
				    Gopher! In those early days of the Web, we were seeing rapid developments
				    in the variety of services which were being provided on the Web and many
				    new open standards being developed. However over time, and as the Web
				    matured and the rate of innovation slowed, there was an increasing realisation
				    of the need to provide a more stable environment for technical developments
				    and the corresponding need to address the issue of compliance. </p>
				  <p >In 2000 JISC funded the QA Focus project (<a href="../http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/qa-focus/" target="_blank">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/qa-focus/</a>)
				    to develop a quality assurance framework, which would help ensure that
				    future projects would comply with standards and recommendations and deploy
				    best practices (Kelly, 2003). The project&rsquo;s aim was to develop
				    a quality assurance (QA) methodology which would help to ensure that
				    projects funded by JISC digital library programmes were functional, widely
				    accessible and interoperable; to provide support materials to accompany
				    the QA framework and to help to embed the QA methodology in projects&rsquo; working
				    practices. Liaison with a number of projects provided feedback on the
				    current approach to use of standards. The feedback indicated: (a) a lack
				    of awareness of the standards document; (b) difficulties in seeing how
				    the standards could be applied to projects&rsquo; particular needs; (c)
				    concerns that the standards would change during the project lifetime;
				    (d) lack of technical expertise and time to implement appropriate standards;
				    (e) concerns that standards may not be sufficiently mature to be used;
				    (f) concerns that the mainstream browsers may not support appropriate
				    standards and (g) concerns that projects were not always starting from
				    scratch but may be building on existing work and in such cases it would
				    be difficult to deploy appropriate standards. Many of these were legitimate
				    concerns, which needed to be addressed in future programmes.</p>
				  <p >This feedback was very valuable and provided a counter-balance
				    to views which suggested the need for a heavyweight compliance regime
				    which forced projects to comply fully with a technical architecture and
				    corresponding open standards. The feedback led to the development of
				    a contextual framework which is described later.</p>
				  <h3>Case Study 2: Support
				      For The NOF-digitise Programme</h3>
				  <p >Unlike the approaches taken by JISC, the NOF-digitise
				    programme involved the use of an external standards compliance service.
				    This approach taken required projects to report on any deviance from
				    documented open standards. In addition a limited amount of checking of
				    project Web sites was also carried out. Initial reports from some of
				    the projects and discussion on mailing lists showed that there were occasions
				    when full compliance with mandated standards was not felt to be possible
				    as compliance would likely reduce the effectiveness or usability of the
				    Web site. In order to address this, the project reporting form was changed
				    to allow projects to document reasons for non-compliance, supported by
				    an FAQ document which provided examples of permissible non-compliance.</p>
				  <p >This flexibility helped the programme to produce
				    valuable cultural heritage on-line services within the timescale of the
				    programme. However, on reflection, the approach taken in support of the
				    NOF-digitise programme had its limitations:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">External
				      compliance checking: </strong>An
				      external body was used to check compliance with open standards. However,
				      there are issues related to the cost of providing this service and
				      the expertise needed in order to monitor the diversity of solutions
				      developed.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Lack
				      of embedding: </strong>There
				      was a danger that third party compliance checking the use
				      of open standards mean the standards would fail to be embedded in other
				      development work, leading to a lack of embedding and a danger that
				      the open standards approach would fail to be embedded within the organisation.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Lack
				      of a QA framework: </strong>Use
				      of an external compliance checking service could result
				      in failure to develop an internal quality assurance framework.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Limited
				      community involvement: </strong>Although
				      a mailing list was provided to support the projects, in
				      reality this mailing list tended to be used to submit detailed technical
				      queries. There was not really any feel for a sustainable
				      community which would be willing to engage in a wider range of discussions.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p >Although the NOF-digitisation programe proved very
				    successful, reflecting on the limitations of the support infrastructure
				    was useful for looking at best practices which should be adopted to support
				    future development programmes.</p>
				  <h3>Case Study 3: Digitisation
				      Projects Funded By The AHRB </h3>
				  <p >A third example in the UK has been within digitisation
				    projects supported by the UK&rsquo;s funding body for the arts and humanities,
				    the AHRC (Arts and Humanities Research Council). It has funded hundreds
				    of digitisation projects since its establishment as a Research Board
				    in 1998. During its existence, a mixed carrot / stick approach has been
				    adopted to try to ensure the implementation of open standards for the
				    digitisation projects it has been funding. However, this has also been
				    tempered by awareness that open standards by themselves are not enough
				    to ensure successful digital resources. </p>
				  <p >The approach taken has largely revolved around requiring
				    applicants to the funding body to submit a &lsquo;technical appendix&rsquo; alongside
				    the main intellectual submission for funding. The technical appendix
				    requires the applicant to consider numerous issues relating to the creation
				    of a digital resource. This includes not just open standards, but documentation
				    and metadata, rights, preservation and access, etc. This appendix is
				    then marked by experts in the field, examining the formats and standards
				    the project plans to use and also its commitment to established good
				    practice in digitisation. </p>
				  <p >Those projects that are well-prepared, e.g. keen
				    to use open standards, have good plans for metadata and documentation,
				    have considered copyright implications, etc., are given the green light.
				    Those that are not well-thought out (for instance,an insistence on using
				    MS Word or PDF as the sole digital format or a lack of adequate metadata)
				    are informed of the weaknesses in their application, and are usually
				    asked to resubmit at a later date.</p>
				  <p >The panel of humanities computing experts is mainly
				    drawn from the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS), a national advisory
				    service. The involvement of the AHDS within the marking process is part
				    of a larger national strategy relating to digital archiving. Once projects
				    funded by the AHRC have finished, they are obliged to offer a copy of
				    the data to the AHDS digital archive, which has responsibility for managing
				    and disseminating this content. The task of preservation is made much
				    easier by the fact that most material arrives in open formats (e.g. XML
				    or RTF for text, TIFF and JPEG for images). The AHDS has a training and
				    advisory role as well, offering applicants significant advice on digitisation
				    projects before they submit their applications.</p>
				  <p >While there are some weaknesses in the process (notably,
				    there is little technical monitoring of projects once they have commenced),
				    it has succeeded in inculcating a strong belief within the arts and humanities
				    faculties in the importance of open standards and good practice in digitisation.
				    Those keen to succeed in obtaining large research grants have had to
				    respond to the demands for good practice.</p>
				  <p >The process has been running since 1999. The initial
				    concerns of both applicants and markers were, unsurprisingly, to the
				    use of open standards. TIFF, SQL and XML were less established than they
				    are now, and a wide choice of proprietary formats could easily have been
				    taken up. But more recently, the focus has shifted to a more holistic
				    approach to digital creation. Open standards have certainly not been
				    jettisoned, but there has been a realisation that by themselves they
				    are not sufficient to ensure long-lasting, valuable digital resources.</p>
				  <p >This has mainly been because open standards are,
				    depending on the data type being worked with, either easy or difficult
				    to implement. For the more straightforward data types (text, images,
				    databases), the use of open standards is now almost a given. It is now
				    rare to see an application that proposes to create a digitised text using
				    MS Excel, a relatively common event in the early days of digitisation. </p>
				  <p >But even projects that do use open standards can
				    still create poor resources - the importance of other issues (the need
				    for quality metadata, the importance of building sustainable Web sites)
				    now requires greater attention than open standards,. </p>
				  <p >In other fields, however, it has proved impossible
				    to settle on open standards because of the lack of usable standards.
				    For more complex data types such as GIS (Geographical Information Systems),
				    video or audio, proprietary standards have been preferred, perhaps&nbsp; because
				    of their greater functionality, stability, ease-of-use, industry take-up
				    etc. Such issues are known to staff working at the AHDS and involved
				    in marking digitisation applications and they respond in pragmatic fashion,
				    in order to ensure that useful project outcomes can be delivered. </p>
				  <h1>A Conceptual Model For
				      Open Standards</h1>
				  <p >We have described some of the limitations of open
				    standards and the feedback we have received from those seeking to make
				    use of open standards in their development work. However, as we have
				    seen in the third case study, this need not mean an abandonment of a
				    commitment to seek to exploit the benefits of open standards. Nor should
				    it mean imposing a stricter regime for ensuring compliance. Experience
				    has made it clear that there is a need to adopt a culture which is supportive
				    of use of open standards but provides flexibility to cater to the difficulties
				    in achieving this, as was illustrated in the third case study. This culture
				    and approach is based on:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>A
				      contextual model which recognizes the diversity and complexities
				      of the technical, development and funding environments;</li>
				    <li>A
				      process of learning and refinement from patterns of successful
				      and unsuccessful experiences;</li>
				    <li>A
				      support infrastructure based on openness, such as use of
				      Creative Commons to encourage take-up of support materials and address
				      the maintenance and sustainability of such resources.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p >There is a need to recognise the contextual nature
				    to this problem; i.e. there is not a universal solution, but we should
				    try to recognise local, regional and cultural factors which will inform
				    the selection and use of open standards. </p>
				  <p >Over time, in response to the problems outlined,
				    the authors and others have developed a layered approach intended for
				    used in development work (Kelly, 2005). This approach is illustrated
				    in Figure 1.</p>
				  <p class="caption" ><img src="kelly.fig-1.gif" alt="Fig 1: a layered approach to use of standards" width="393" height="300" /></p>
				  <p class="caption"><strong>Fig
                      1: A Layered Approach to Use of Standards</strong></p>
				  <p >This approach uses the following layers:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Contextual
				      Layer: </strong>This
				      reflects the context in which the standards are being used. Large,
				      well-funded organisations may choose to mandate strict use of open
				      standards in order to build large, well-integrated systemsintended
				      for long term use. For a smaller organisation, perhaps reliant on
				      volunteer effort with uncertain long-term viability, a simpler approach
				      may be more appropriate, perhaps making use of proprietary solutions.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Policy
				      Layer: </strong>This
				      provides an annotated description (or catalogue) of relevant
				      policies in a range of areas. The areas will include descriptions of
				      standards, ownership, maturity, risk assessment, etc. It summarises
				      the strengths and weaknesses of the standards.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Compliance
				      Layer: </strong>This
				      describes mechanisms to ensure that development work complies
				      with the requirements defined within the particular context. For large,
				      public funded programmes there could be a formal monitoring
				      process carried out by external auditors. In other contexts, projects
				      may be expected to carry out their own self-assessment. In such cases,
				      the findings could be simply used internally within the
				      project, or, alternatively, reported (if deviations are significant)
				      to the funding body.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p >It should be noted that, although it is possible
				    to deploy this three-layered approach within a funding programme or community,
				    there will be a need to recognise external factors over which there may
				    be no direct control. This may include legal factors, wider organisational
				    factors (for example, there are differences between higher and further
				    education, museums, libraries and archives), cultural factors, and available
				    funding and resources etc.</p>
				  <p >It is also important to note that the contextual
				    approach is not intended to provide an excuse to continue to make use
				    of proprietary solutions which may fail to provide the required interoperability.
				    Rather, the approach seeks to ensure that a pragmatic approach is taken
				    and that lessons can be learnt from the experiences gained. In order
				    to ensure that the experiences are shared across the development community
				    (and more widely), it will be important to ensure that systematic procedures
				    are in place to ensure that the experiences are properly recorded and
				    widely disseminated.</p>
				  <p >A requirement that funded projects should document
				    their decisions on the selection of the standards to be used and provide
				    reports based on their experiences in the use of the standards will help
				    to ensure that such information is recorded in a systematic way. Providing
				    this information in an open and easily accessed fashion will help ensure
				    that such information can be widely disseminated. The use of a Wiki with
				    RSS to allow the content to be syndicated, with news of changes to the
				    information, can help to support this.</p>
				  <p >After the selection and deployment of standards,
				    there will be a need to ensure that the standards are being used in an
				    appropriate fashion. One means of ensuring that this happens is the use
				    of a quality assurance framework to ensure that technical policies are
				    documented and that systematic procedures for ensuring that the policies
				    are being implemented correctly are in place. Feedback on the process
				    and standards used is also key for success.</p>
				  <p >Following validation of the ideas documented above,
				    the approaches are now being deployed by JISC as part of its support
				    infrastructure for development programmes.</p>
				  <h1>Supporting
				      This Model </h1>
				  <p >The provision and implementation of a model which
				    provides a pragmatic approach to the selection and use of standards will
				    not guarantee that appropriate decisions are made and that the selected
				    standards are deployed in the most appropriate fashion. There will be
				    a need to ensure that a support infrastructure is in place to ensure
				    that technical managers, implementers, designers and others involved
				    in research and development activities are able to make technical decisions
				    appropriate for the intended purpose.</p>
				  <p >A support model which is being developed is illustrated
				    in Figure 2.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="kelly.fig-2.gif" alt="Fig 2: Support Model for Use of Standards" width="394" height="298" /></p>
				  <p class="caption"><strong>Fig
				    2:&nbsp; Support Model For Use of Standards</strong></p>
				  <p >This support model is based on the following features:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">The
				      contextual model</strong>:
				      This is described elsewhere in this paper. The contextual model has
				      been developed primarily for use by the development community. The
				      end user community need not be aware of the contextual model which
				      was used as part of the development process.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">User
				      engagement</strong>:
				      Engagement with the user community will be essential to
				      ensure the sustainability of the approach &ndash; the development approach
				      is not an end in itself, but a means for satisfying the needs of the
				      end user community.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p >There are several user communities involved in development
				    activities. The <em>development community</em> will typically focus on
				    areas related to the standards, development approach and related areas.
				    The <em>user community</em>, in contrast, will often be uninterested
				    in such issues, concerned primarily with use of a service which functions
				    effectively. Although developers should be aware of the needs to address
				    end user needs, it may be difficult to achieve this goal. It should therefore
				    be a requirement of the <em>funding body</em> or organisation to ensure
				    that mechanisms are put in place to ensure that the approaches taken
				    in development will ensure that the needs of the user community are satisfied. </p>
				  <p >Mechanisms for ensuring the development work is
				    successful in meeting user needs may include:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Advocacy</strong>:
				      There will be a need for the development community to promote the advantages
				      of the preferred approaches to development. This could include promoting
				      the advantages of use of open standards. Such advocacy needs to be
				      tailored for the intended target audience, with other developers and
				      end users requiring different approaches.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Feedback</strong>:
				      A wide range of feedback will be required. For example,
				      developers will need to provide detailed feedback on the contents of
				      the standards catalogue; funders on the contextual model and implementation
				      experiences; and end users on the end user service. </li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Engagement</strong>:
				      A passive feedback mechanism is unlikely to provide useful
				      feedback. A more effective approach is to provide engaging mechanisms
				      which not only act as a one-way transfer of information, but also provide
				      richer two-way discussions. </li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Refinement</strong>:
				      The feedback and engagement processes should help to refine
				      those areas in which deficiencies have been identified. This could
				      include over-simplistic or over-complex approaches to the development
				      model.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <h1>The Parallel With Web 2.0</h1>
				  <p >The Web 2.0 term gained popularity after our involvement
				    in supporting the eLib, JISC Information Environment and NOF-digitise
				    programmes. However the underlying principles associated with Web 2.0,
				    such as the focus on the user and on user participation and a flexible &lsquo;always
				    beta&rsquo; approach, have strong parallels with the conclusions reached
				    in our support work, including:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">A
				      culture of openness and sharing</strong>:
				      People are now being more open about the way they do things. This
				      often means more use of open standards but can also mean being up
				      front about their inappropriateness or limited use. </li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Aiming
				      for simplicity</strong>:
				      The current trend is for simplicity and ease of use. Many
				      Web 2.0 services which are popular with the end user community can
				      also be exploited by the museums development community. This can provide
				      several benefits: software and services are already in
				      place, so no effort is required in installing and configuring software. </li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Willingness
				      to take risks</strong>:
				      One other important aspect of Web 2.0 is the apparent weighing
				      up of risk. Often there is a risk factor in using these services as
				      there are no guarantees that they will always be around,
				      but people are finding that the benefits of use outweigh the risks.
				      The increasing willingness to take risk is relative. Waiting for solutions
				      to be perfect has its own set of risks. </li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">A
				      culture of sharing: </strong>Web
				      2.0 has many opportunities and mechanisms for peer-to-peer
				      support: Learning from the experiences of other developers can be particularly
				      valuable. Mechanisms for providing such peer-to-peer support
				      can build on existing approaches (face-to-face meeting; use of e-mail
				      lists, bulletin boards, etc.) and explore use of Web 2.0
				      communication tools and social networking services.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">A
				      community-approach: </strong>It
				      will be important for mechanisms to be in place to ensure
				      that support materials can be maintained and the support infrastructure
				      is sustainable. Approaches based on building on established Communities
				      of Practice are being explored.</li>
				    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Being
				      flexible: </strong>Web
				      2.0 uses the expression &lsquo;always beta&rsquo;. This expresses
				      the concept of ongoing development and responsivity to
				      user experiences and feedback.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <h1>Conclusions</h1>
				  <p >This paper has argued that what is needed is a more
				    contextual approach to open standards. It could be argued that what we
				    need is not a list of open standards but an <em>open standards process</em> based
				    on a desire to exploit the potential benefits of open standards, tempered
				    by a degree of flexibility to ensure that the importance of satisfying
				    end users&rsquo; needs and requirements is not lost and that over-complex
				    solutions are avoided. This process could adopt the contextual approach
				    documented in this paper and watch patterns of usage. </p>
				  <p >The contextual approach aims to provide a degree
				    of flexibility. In addition, a community-led approach based on a culture
				    of sharing and openness can help the development community. The concepts
				    associated with Web 2.0, used in conjunction with Web 2.0 applications
				    such as social networking tools, can provide a valuable mechanism for
				    realising this aim.</p>
