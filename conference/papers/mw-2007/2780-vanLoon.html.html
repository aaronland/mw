				  <h1>Introduction</h1>
				  <p>The use of a pocket-sized computer in a museum as
				    a tool to enhance the visit experience has found its way into many museums
				    over the last five years. Science centres, heritage institutions
				    and contemporary museums like Tate Modern in London, the Marble Museum
				    in Carrara, the Exploratorium in San Francisco, and Torre Aquila in Trento
				    have been experimenting with mobile applications. For a state-of-the-art
				    and more detailed review of mobile applications in museums and cultural
				    environments, see&nbsp; Proctor &amp; Tellis (2003), Raptis et al. (2005),
				    and Linaza et al. (2006).</p>
				  <p>Pioneers of multimedia guides are still exploring
				    the best ways to make use of them, but meanwhile there is already some
				    consensus on the strengths and pitfalls of PDAs. First of all,
				    PDA technology allows the dynamic presentation of information without
				    disturbing the physical space of the exhibition and not limited by the
				    aesthetics of the gallery. Secondly, handheld devices enable visitors
				    to browse information at their own pace and according to their own interests. And
				    last but not least, they give scope for offering something entirely different
				    from a conventional label; namely, a wide range of content and media,
				    putting sound, photos, videos, text and interactive games in the palms
				    of visitors&rsquo; hands. Starting from these advantages, screen-based
				    multimedia guides can be welcome additions to the visitor experience. However,
				    the first PDA-based applications in museums also revealed some important
				    shortcomings. The device demands a lot of attention. It generates the
				    unintended side effect that it is quite an individual experience, and
				    thus it isolates visitors from one another (Vom Lehn &amp; Heath, 2005;
				    Vom Lehn, Heath &amp; Hindmarsh, 2005; Angliss, 2006a, 2006b). With
				    the ARCHIE project, we want to deal with these negative side effects
				    and explore the different possibilities a mobile museum guide can offer
				    in the future: greater versatility for visitors to get information tailored
				    to their needs and interests (personalization), the opportunity to discover
				    the exhibits at their own pace (localization), and stimulation through&nbsp; social
				    interaction among family or group members (communication).</p>
				  <p>In their leading reference work on learning in museums,
				    Falk and Dierking (2000) came to emphasize the role of the social group
				    in the way visitors construct meaning in their contextual model of learning. Following
				    this model, social interaction&nbsp; not only promotes, but also is a
				    prerequisite for, intellectual, social, personal and cultural development
				    (Morrissey, 2002). Recent studies with children and object-centered
				    learning also recognize the importance of social interaction:</p>
				  <p class="BlockQuote">the potential of the learning environment and its
				    objects largely depends on the social atmosphere generated and the support
				    young children receive through positive, reciprocal interactions. [&hellip;]
				    The successful learning setting functions as a community of learners,
				    where all individuals are respected, their learning is supported, and
				    opportunities for collaboration are provided (Piscitelli &amp; Weier,
				    2002, p. 126).</p>
				  <p>Though the research on social interaction and collaboration
				    using new technologies is quite recent (Hawkey, 2004), there are already
				    some projects on museum co-visiting. The Sotto Voce project developed
				    an electronic guidebook prototype that promotes interaction between museum
				    visitors through content and audio sharing (Woodruff, Aoki, Hurst &amp; Szymanski,
				    2001). This study resulted in an interesting set of design principles,
				    but the collaboration between companions is rather passive (following
				    or checking in tasks). The goal of the Cicero Project (Laurillau &amp; Patern&ograve;,
				    2004) &ndash; to promote social interaction between visitors through
				    cooperative and educational games &ndash; fits in with our project. Also
				    the reported findings of the user tests of the &lsquo;Mystery in the
				    Museum&rsquo; game in the Solomos Museum are very interesting (Cabrera
				    et al., 2005). However, we hope to take the idea of a collaborative
				    learning activity one step further than the above-mentioned edugames
				    which are still to be played at a quite individual level with only a
				    shared enigma.</p>
				  <p>In collaboration with the museum team of the Gallo-Roman
				    Museum, we decided to develop a prototype of a learning activity for
				    (school) groups of children 10-14 years old. These youngsters are
				    one of the main target groups of the museum. Extensive visitor
				    research the museum organised in 2005 pointed out that they have an especially
				    strong interest in multimedia and games (Provincial Gallo-Roman Museum,
				    2005). Therefore, a collaborative museum game on PDA can be a perfect
				    means to support a museum visit for these young people. With this
				    first application, we want to verify the usefulness of the service and
				    test whether it supports our goals.</p>
				  <h1>Designing a Collaborative Trading Game on PDA</h1>
				  <p>An appropriate design process runs through different
				    phases from concept generation to implementation and evaluation. In
				    our HCI research group, we worked from a User-Centered Design (UCD) approach. The
				    main idea of UCD is to involve the users of a product throughout its
				    lifecycle, from planning through post-release assessment, in order to
				    guarantee positive user experience (usability, accessibility, functionality,
				    etc.)&nbsp; (Redmond-Pyle &amp; Moore, 1995). While the basic
				    principles are the same, different variations of User-Centered Design
				    processes exist. The International Organization for Standardization
				    (ISO) states that there are four human-centered activities that should
				    take place during a system development project. These activities
				    are</p>
				  <ol>
				    <li>understanding and specifying the context of
				      use,</li>
				    <li>specifying the user and organizational requirements,</li>
				    <li>producing design solutions,</li>
				    <li>evaluating designs against requirements.</li>
			    </ol>
				  <p>The human-centered design process should start at
				    the earliest stage of the project and should be repeated iteratively
				    until the system meets the specified requirements&nbsp; (International
				    Organization for Standardization, 1999) &ndash; see Figure 1.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><a href="vanLoon-fig1.html"><img src="vanloon-figure1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Fig 1: The interdependence of human-centered design activities" width="400" height="152" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 1: The interdependence of human-centered design
				    activities</p>
				  <p>Extensive user analysis and constant evaluation are
				    typical activities in the User-Centered Design process, and they also
				    played important roles when we designed our prototype. </p>
				  <h1>A Six-Phase Process of Design</h1>
				  <p>Our process consists of 6 phases we believe to be
				    important for future designers (see Figure 2). Some steps may seem
				    new and others are may be over- emphasized, but in the end it is the
				    same story as the ISO standard: analysis, design, evaluation and numerous
				    iterations.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><a href="vanLoon-fig2.html"><img src="vanloon-figure2-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Design process of the prototype" width="400" height="226" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">Figure 2: Design process of the prototype</p>
				  <p>Concerning the borderlines between the different phases
				    of the design process, it is wrong to suggest every phase has a clear
				    beginning and end: rather, they&nbsp; blend into each other and are repeatedly
				    evaluated. </p>
				  <h2>1. User Analysis</h2>
				  <p>In the context of future expansion, the Gallo-Roman
				    Museum conducted an extensive investigation among its visitors and potential
				    visitors to find out what prompts them to visit the museum, what their
				    interests are, and how they want to learn about the collection (Provincial
				    Gallo-Roman Museum, 2005). The results of this visitor research
				    were used to provide us with&nbsp; profiles, visit expectations, learning
				    styles, visit behaviour, and preferences concerning information and presentation
				    for the main target groups.</p>
				  <p>One of these target groups is the &lsquo;auto-active
				    experiencers&rsquo;, aged between 10 and 14, who visit the museum with
				    their school. They like multimedia and computers: they also like
				    them in museum presentation. As their name points out, their main
				    expectation is to experience the museum and relax, have a nice day out. Their
				    ideal museum is an amusement park. They also have a strong need
				    for hands-on activities, and they like to map out their own routes according
				    to their interests. However,&nbsp; these youngsters prefer an autonomous
				    visit: hanging around with (groups of) friends is really important for
				    them. </p>
				  <p>Besides the contextual information of the target user
				    we obtained through the visitor research, we also conducted a <em>focus
				    group</em> (Preece et al., 2002) of
				    youngsters (4 boys and 2 girls, aged between 12 and 14 years). The
				    main reason was to get better acquainted with their needs and expectations
				    towards a museum game. First, we invited them to think aloud about
				    gaming in the museum, and confronted them with possible consequences,
				    (dis)advantages, practical issues, &hellip;&nbsp; Then we observed them
				    while they were testing our previous demo (a PDA tour to the Neanderthal
				    man exhibition). This gave them the chance to think more concretely about
				    a museum game on a PDA platform and give some feedback (see Figure 3).</p>
				  <p>In general, their main expectations towards a museum
				    game are that it has to</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>be lots of fun, with enough challenges and plenty
				      of variety (a good mix between easy and hard/difficult),</li>
				    <li>promote unconscious learning (young people do
				      not want to get the impression that they are learning),</li>
				    <li>integrate (the most important) objects/exhibits
				      of the museum within the game,</li>
				    <li>provide a personal and adaptable character/avatar
				      (they also like to set their personal settings in the beginning;
				      for example, age, difficulty level &hellip;),</li>
				    <li>encourage playing together/helping each other
				      out (they really liked the idea of a chatbox), although
				      competition between team members is also really important, </li>
				    <li>integrate a help menu within the game (they
				      do not read the manual in advance: they just start and &lsquo;find out&rsquo;). </li>
			    </ul>
				  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a><a href="vanLoon-fig3.html"><img src="vanloon-figure3-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Fig 3: Focus group" width="400" height="139" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 3: Focus group</p>
				  <h2>2. Concept Generation</h2>
				  <p>Starting from the results of the user analysis, we
				    decided to work on a specific chapter of the future museum exhibition
				    concerning the introduction of social differentiation in West European
				    society (around 825 BC). The main message is the introduction of
				    iron objects and salt as a seasoning in daily life. This results
				    in new exchange networks with the Hallstatt region (South Germany and
				    Austria). Ambitious individuals from the local population emerge
				    as key figures in these contacts and start to form a socially distinct
				    elite class. It is really important to take some time to consider
				    attentively the main idea or message of the exhibition, because the presentation
				    (and also the PDA tour) must directly reflect this (Katz et al., 2006). </p>
				  <p>The emergence of an elite class, new exchange networks
				    and new products inspired us to design a collaborative trading game for
				    teams of 4 persons. In this conceptual phase, we constructed a <em>scenario</em> for
				    the game which includes:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>number of players, their roles and goals</li>
				    <li>rules of play</li>
				    <li>different phases within the game, how it evolves</li>
				    <li>extra ideas, alternatives</li>
				    <li>how the game could fit into an overall museum
				      game</li>
				    <li>possible errors </li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>We decided that every player had to have an explicit
				    role in the game: there are three farmers and one leader. Each
				    one has individual properties and specific goals that need to be achieved. By
				    solving questions or playing little games, farmers have the possibility
				    of gaining or augmenting their exchangeable goods (local products like
				    cattle, sheep &hellip;). The leader has an overall view of&nbsp; the
				    earned exchangeable goods of his farmers, and only he can make them a
				    trade proposal. The leader also has exclusive contacts in the exchange
				    networks: he can travel to the Hallstatt region three times during the
				    game to exchange local products for iron objects and salt. While every
				    farmer has as a goal obtaining a specific amount of iron and salt, the
				    leader&rsquo;s objective is to keep every farmer satisfied (this means
				    making sure that every farmer obtains his goals) and to get hold of a
				    bronze sword.</p>
				  <p>The game is designed so that every player is dependent
				    on the concrete actions of other players; only through social interaction
				    and cooperation can they can come to a good result. The main message
				    is to learn in an unconscious way about unequal stratifications in society:
				    how they came into existence, how they worked, and more precisely, how
				    it must have felt to actually be in an unequal position.</p>
				  <h2>3. Conceptual Design</h2>
				  <p>With the scenario written down, we started to create
				    a <em>user task model</em>: this is
				    a scheme which maps out all possible user actions and activities in each
				    stage of the game (Mori et al., 2002). User task models are frequently
				    used to specify requirements for an application from a user&rsquo;s point
				    of view. These task models allow gradual refinement of the high-level
				    tasks and goals into fine-grained actions and activities. </p>
				  <p>This structured description gives input to a more
				    specific <em>storyboard</em> which
				    includes user needs, functional information, and all aspects of the UI:
				    buttons, navigation, actions, etc. The storyboard also contains
				    the first mock-ups of the user interface (low-fidelity prototyping)&nbsp; created
				    by the designers using information from the scenario and user task model
				    (see Figure 4).</p>
				  <p>During conceptual design, ideas of the concept generation
				    phase are constantly evaluated on feasibility. For example, in
				    the first scenario we had the idea that in the last stage of the game
				    the leader should manually distribute the iron objects and salt among
				    his farmers. But while we were working on the user task model,
				    it soon became clear that this would take too much time from the leader. Because
				    this is not interesting for the other players, we decided that the distribution
				    of iron and salt should happen automatically when the leader returns
				    from the Hallstatt region. The storyboard also quickly reveals
				    possible problems and difficulties for programming the game. </p>
				  <p>During the next phases, the low-fidelity prototypes
				    of the user interface will gradually evolve towards what is called high-fidelity
				    prototypes, the concrete and final user interface.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig4" id="Fig4"></a><a href="vanLoon-fig4.html"><img src="vanloon-figure4-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Fig 4: Sketches from the storyboard" width="400" height="291" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 4: Sketches from the storyboard</p>
				  <h2>4. Architectural Design</h2>
				  <p>Once the functional requirements for the system had
				    been specified, we started to think about the overall software architecture. This
				    resulted in the ARCHIE Mobile Guide System which consists of a set of
				    three core services (personalization, localization and communication)
				    on top of which an arbitrary interface shell can be deployed (see Figure
				    5). The core services are in fact proxies that communicate with
				    a central server containing a database of visitor profiles, visitor groups,
				    artefact locations, etc. Although an interface shell can make use
				    of the different core services, it can be developed quite independently;
				    it only has to handle events sent by the services it is subscribed on.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a><a href="vanLoon-fig5.html"><img src="vanloon-figure5-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Fig 5: Framework overview" width="400" height="214" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 5: Framework overview</p>
				  <p>This approach results in a flexible mobile guide system
				    rather than one particular mobile guide: various interface shells that
				    behave differently can be developed, and by using the communication service
				    which handles the interaction between visitors, it is possible to implement
				    collaborative applications such as games.</p>
				  <p>The trading game is actually an interface shell that
				    is developed on top of the ARCHIE framework and makes use of its several
				    core services. The localization service is used for determining
				    when the game has to be started; namely, when all team members are nearby
				    the physical presentation of the particular museum narrative. This
				    is realized by catching and interpreting the events from the localization
				    service. This service makes use of the wireless network to determine
				    the location of the visitor. Personalization is realized by assigning
				    each team member a specific role &ndash; farmer or leader &ndash; and
				    by providing each person with an individual adaptable character (avatar). The
				    communication service makes it possible for team- mates to communicate
				    directly with each other through a chatbox. They can use this Voice-over-IP-based
				    communication channel to negotiate or comment on the trade proposals
				    and/or to help each other solve the questions. An indirect communication
				    style allows visitors to exchange other types of data and is carried
				    out by the trade actions which are necessary to accomplish the game. By
				    sending a trade proposal to a farmer, the leader initiates indirect communication.
				    The farmer replies by accepting or refusing this trade proposal. The
				    data that is exchanged between the players is obviously game related.</p>
				  <p>A good architecture partitions the system&rsquo;s
				    present and foreseeable requirements into a set of loosely coupled subsystems
				    with each a high internal cohesion (Larman, 2004). Low coupling improves
				    the ease of development, and software changes in one module will affect
				    fewer other modules. High cohesion is achieved by grouping similar tasks
				    in one module. The ARCHIE Mobile Guide System fulfills these requirements.
				    Changes in one of the core services do not demand change in other core
				    services, and new services can be easily added. Also, creating new interface
				    shells does not require a new software structure since there is no hard
				    binding between the interface shells and the core services because of
				    the event bus interface.</p>
				  <p>Once the system architecture is clearly defined, implementation
				    can be started.</p>
				  <h2>5. Content Development</h2>
				  <p>When the scenario and storyboard are ready, and computer
				    scientists have started the implementation of the game, it is possible
				    to start focusing on the concrete content development. &nbsp;It is possible
				    to argue that this stage has already started during or after the concept
				    generation phase, because deciding on the main message of the exhibition,
				    the game, rules of play, etc. can also be interpreted as content development. Again,
				    the borderlines between the different phases of the design process should
				    not be seen as strict.</p>
				  <p>It is important to take time to decide what topics,
				    exhibits, angles of approach, and type of questions the PDA should take
				    care of. This exercise helps to analyse the content and show how&nbsp; it
				    can clarify, summarize and/or emphasize the main idea of the exhibition. This
				    analysis is also important to get a clear view of a visitor&rsquo;s (possible)
				    understanding and participation throughout the exhibition. The
				    content should be catchy enough to trigger the visitor to extend and
				    go deeper into this virtual visit without neglecting the surrounding
				    exhibits. This brings us to an important design issue: the information
				    balance. In a museum environment, there are multiple entities that
				    deliver information to the visitor ( museum exhibits, companions and
				    in this case, the PDA). To manage the constantly changing demands
				    of these entities, each visitor performs a sophisticated balancing act
				    (Woodruff et al., 2001). The mobile guide should help visitors
				    balance their attention in a natural way and therefore maximize their
				    enjoyment of the visit. And in all ways, the content developer
				    should avoid possible information overload.</p>
				  <p>Concerning interface, media and content, we developed
				    some guidelines or sensitivities that can help the content developer
				    and user interface designer to create an interactive handheld guide that
				    fits appropriately into a visitor&rsquo;s desired experience. These
				    sensitivities underline critical issues that should be considered while
				    designing in order to encourage interaction between visitors and the
				    museum. Note the following suggestions.</p>
				  <h3>User Interface</h3>
				  <ul>
				    <li>Keep it consistent, intuitive and clear. </li>
				    <li>Provide a short introduction to all the buttons
				      and functions. </li>
				    <li>Make it work with a selection menu that lets
				      the visitor remain in control of the information delivery.</li>
				    <li>Visual selection (of objects) is preferred above
				      entering numbers.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <h3>Information / Type Of Media</h3>
				  <ul>
				    <li>Present information in small, easily-digested
				    snippets: captions, sounds, videos and photos are preferred.</li>
				    <li>Choose audio presentation of descriptions rather
				      than written paragraphs.</li>
				    <li>Keep text on screen to a minimum. </li>
				    <li>Keep audio and video clips short (30-40 seconds
				      maximum).</li>
				    <li>Avoid playing audio while showing text on screen
				      at the same time .</li>
			    </ul>
				  <h3>Content</h3>
				  <ul>
				    <li>Encourage visitors to look (more profoundly)
				      at the exhibits (for example, zoom into details).</li>
				    <li>Direct the visitor&rsquo;s gaze by use of spoken
				      instructions and low-key animations on screen when it&rsquo;s time
				      to look at the real object.</li>
				    <li>Stimulate comment and discussion about the exhibition. </li>
				    <li>Provide hardware and content for retrieval by
				      two persons or more.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>The trading game we were developing includes an introductory
				    movie (with audio) and a set of 20 multiple choice questions about museum
				    exhibits (including images). The introductory movie is a flash
				    animation which runs for one minute. It provides some background
				    information on the game and a very short explanation of all 4 buttons. The
				    audio captions consist of very short sentences, on average 10-12 words
				    each. </p>
				  <p>Most of the multiple choice questions are introduced
				    through an image of a museum exhibit and the direction, &lsquo;Look for
				    this object&rsquo;. Once the museum object has been found, the
				    visitor continues to answer the questions. It is also possible
				    to visually select one of the multiple answers by clicking on an image-button. </p>
				  <p>Text on screen; for example, the multiple choice questions
				    and the explanations within the help menu, is kept minimal (sentences
				    with 5-6 words on average). We use a clear and readable font, with
				    enough contrasting colours. The overall user interface is uncomplicated
				    and consistent, and&nbsp; the use of buttons (back, next) and wizards
				    is intuitive (see Figure 6).</p>

				  <h2>6. Evaluation</h2>
				  <p>This last phase is probably one of the most important
				    steps within the design process, and unfortunately it is also the one
				    most often neglected. Designers quickly assume that if they and their
				    colleagues can use the software and find it attractive, others will too. Furthermore,
				    they prefer to avoid evaluation because it adds development time and
				    costs money. But without evaluation, designers cannot be sure that
				    their software is usable. Although there are many definitions and
				    many different evaluation techniques (Preece et al., 2002), we decided
				    to involve the future users directly to check whether their needs are
				    being met. </p>
				  <p>In a first iteration, we organised an informal initial
				    evaluation of the first workable prototype. We asked some colleagues
				    (both software development experts and users with no experience in software
				    development) to try our first prototype (which did not contain images,
				    nor the introduction movie at that point) and give some feedback. This
				    internal evaluation quickly revealed some errors, problems, inconsistencies &hellip; and
				    gave us a clear view of what had to be changed to make the interface
				    more usable and intuitive. </p>
				  <p>Three weeks later, after the prototype had been adapted
				    according to the recommendations of the informal initial evaluation,
				    we visited three secondary schools in and around Hasselt (two general
				    schools and one technical). In all cases, our contact person at
				    the school was the history teacher who arranged some time (during class
				    or lunch break), space (a class room that simulated a museum gallery &ndash; posters
				    of museum objects were placed on the tables) and groups of students (8
				    students per session) to test our prototype. First, we gave them
				    a short introduction to the ARCHIE project and asked if they were familiar
				    with the Gallo-Roman Museum. Because the museum is well-known in
				    the region, almost all students had already visited it at least once. We
				    divided the 8 students into 2 groups of 4 players and handed over the
				    PDAs. During the test the students were observed (see Figure 7),
				    and afterwards they were asked to fill in a questionnaire. This
				    consisted of 20 questions concerning both personal background, and the
				    usability and playability of the trading game. Because it is easier
				    to process specific answers that can be categorized, we worked with multiple
				    choice questions and Likert scales. There was only one open ended
				    question in the end: &lsquo;Do you have other ideas or remarks?&rsquo;&nbsp; Besides
				    the observations and questionnaires, we also logged user actions on the
				    PDA.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig7" id="Fig7"></a><a href="vanLoon-fig7.html"><img src="vanloon-figure7-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Fig 7: Usability tests" width="400" height="139" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 7: Usability tests</p>
				  <p>In total, 68 school children between 11 and 15 years
				    old participated in the usability test (55%&nbsp; aged 13 years). More
				    boys (75%) joined the tests; this follows from the fact that the largest
				    part of the usability tests was held at the technical school (where in
				    terms of percentage more boys attend). Further test results, however,
				    did not indicate any difference between boys and girls. As expected,
				    all the young people were extremely experienced in ICT. On a daily
				    basis, 78 % have access to a PC, 76 % use the Internet, and 63 % own
				    a mobile phone. They frequently play computer games and chat with
				    friends. A PDA is the only medium they do not know well, but this
				    does not mean they have problems using it: 82 % say it is very easy to
				    use. </p>
				  <p>Concerning the trading game, all students found it
				    very funny and nice to play. Although we told them that it was
				    just a prototype, their only remark was that the game should last a bit
				    longer. Also the chatbox service was positively evaluated: they
				    really liked it, found it easy to use, and 88 % would certainly use it
				    during a museum visit: &lsquo;to stay in contact with family and friends
				    while they aren&rsquo;t nearby&rsquo;, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s nice and handy&rsquo;, &lsquo;to
				    pass information&rsquo;, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s an amusing way to learn something
				    new&rsquo; &hellip;&nbsp; They are also very positive about the idea
				    of a PDA as a museum guide, because &lsquo;it&rsquo;s more fun&rsquo; (85%), &lsquo;I
				    can map out my own route&rsquo; (40%), &lsquo;I understand things better&rsquo; (30%),
				    and &lsquo;it&rsquo;s more informative&rsquo; (20%).</p>
				  <p>Our general conclusion about the usability tests is
				    that young people are enthusiastic about the PDA medium: they only want
				    more of it (more questions, more possibilities to adapt their avatar,
				    etc). One of the standard questions they asked us after the usability
				    test was, &lsquo;When will it be installed in the museum?&rsquo; Another
				    was, &lsquo;When will you come again?&rsquo;&nbsp; The application also
				    seems to support our goals: observations confirm that the trading game
				    provoked collaboration and lots of social interaction among its players,
				    and there was also a good balance between looking on screen and looking
				    around. The questions stimulated the students to look around and
				    examine the museum objects (in this case, the images on the posters). </p>
				  <p>It is notable that young people do not read text on
				    screen, nor listen to very long audio captions. A good example
				    is the introductory movie: all participants indicated the movie is clear,
				    but our&nbsp; observation confirmed that they just watched the movie
				    without listening. Another example is the chatbox: some students
				    asked us how they can use this service even though the directions for
				    use can be read on the screen. It is really important to make the
				    screen more visually appealing; for example, by placing text in balloons,
				    by making lips move when a character is telling something, by working
				    with multiple voices/dialects, etc. </p>
				  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
				  <p>ARCHIE is an interdisciplinary research project which
				    aims to discover how a handheld guide can be used to enhance the museum
				    learning experience. Because we stress the important role of social
				    interaction as a prerequisite for intellectual, social, personal and
				    cultural development, one of the main objectives of the ARCHIE project
				    is to encourage and stimulate interaction both with the museum and with
				    fellow visitors, using the PDA as a communication medium. We have
				    developed an initial application that incorporates the concepts discussed
				    in this paper: a collaborative trading game. The design process
				    that leads to this prototype consists of 6 steps: user analysis, concept
				    generation, conceptual design, architectural design, content development
				    and evaluation. User tests pointed out that the objective of social
				    interaction has been accomplished and that the PDA enhances user experience
				    significantly. The ARCHIE mobile guide framework that was used
				    for the trading game is currently being extended so that more complex
				    museum visits (e.g. an overall museum game for different types of groups)
				    can be supported.</p>
