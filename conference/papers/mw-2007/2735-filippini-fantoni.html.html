      <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="abstractText">Over the past few years, some museums have launched 
        multimedia projects (on PDAs, kiosks, and Web sites) that allow visitors 
        to bookmark information of interest for later use at home or in the classroom, 
        in at attempt to prolong the museum experience, build a stronger relationship 
        with the visitor, and facilitate the learning process. Despite its great 
        potential, however, there is still very little evidence that bookmarking 
        actually works in the terms envisaged by its promoters. To consider this 
        question, we will analyze examples of different on-line and on-site applications, 
        accompanied by a detailed investigation of usage statistics and evaluation 
        results carried out in part by the authors and in part by museums. We 
        will consider case studies from Tate Modern, the J. Paul Getty Museum, 
        the Museum of Science in Boston, and The Tech Museum of Innovation in 
        San Jose, among others.</p>

    <h2 class=PaperTitle>Introduction</h2>
    <p>No longer content within the physical confines of the actual building, 
      museum professionals have been taking advantage of new technologies such 
      as the Internet, handheld devices (PDAs, etc.) and mobile phones to reach 
      their public at home, in the classroom, and on the move. One of the most 
      interesting tools to support this need of extending the experience (Falk 
      &amp; Dierking, 1992) beyond the confines of the museum itself has proven 
      to be &quot;bookmarking&quot; (Filippini-Fantoni, 2006a), the moniker given 
      to a range of technologies that allow visitors to &quot;save&quot; information 
      of personal interest (Hidi, 1990). The bookmarking of Web pages, implemented 
      within Web browsers, has been in use since the 1990s (Abrams &amp; Baecker, 
      1997). In the context of this paper, bookmarking may involve information 
      from the museum Web site, kiosks or audio guide (MP3 player, handheld device 
      or mobile phone) for later use. It provides a degree of personalization 
      for users (Bowen &amp; Filippini-Fantoni, 2004; Filippini-Fantoni &amp; 
      Bowen, 2005). Visitors can retrieve the bookmarked information either via 
      links in an e-mail sent to the visitor at the end of their visit or via 
      a personal page on the museum's Web site, accessible to the visitor through 
      a username and password. If bookmarks from other visitors can be accessed 
      (e.g., on-line or via e-mail), a sense of virtual community can be generated 
      (Beler et al., 2004).</p>
    <p>When well-integrated into the visitor experience, bookmarking can be a 
      powerful tool for supporting the learning experience in museums (Csikszentmihalyi 
      &amp; Hermanson, 1995) and creating a stronger relationship between the 
      institution and the visitor. The ability to save an important part of the 
      content encountered during the museum visit and access it at home or in 
      another context allows the visitor the possibility of focusing more on discovery 
      and the aesthetic experience while in the museum and to leave the more traditional 
      didactic aspects for later. Research also indicates that repetition is a 
      major mechanism for retaining memories over time (Brown &amp; Kulick, 1997), 
      so bookmarking can play an important role in increasing visitors' knowledge 
      about a collection or exhibition as well as stimulating a positive response 
      to their visit and the intrinsic desire to learn more. In a culture of &quot;information 
      on demand&quot;, bookmarking has the potential to become a major bridge 
      between the &quot;real&quot; and the &quot;virtual&quot; museum visit.</p>
    <h2>One Tool, Multiple Platforms</h2>
    <p>Because of its great potential, in the past few years some of the world's 
      leading museums have been progressively incorporating bookmarking facilities 
      into their Web sites, kiosks and audio guide solutions. A selection of museums 
      offering ongoing and past bookmarking projects is provided in Table 1.</p>

    <p class=caption>Table 1: A selection of museums offering ongoing and past 
      bookmarking tools, <br />
      organized by type of platform.</p>
    <p>The first examples of bookmarking to appear were on-line applications, 
      including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the Virtual Museums of Canada <br />
        (My Personal Museum, <a href="../http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/English/Personal" target="_blank">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/English/Personal</a>)</li>
      <li> the Metropolitan Museum of Art <br />
        (My Met Museum, <a
href="../http://www.metmuseum.org/mymetmuseum" target="_blank">http://www.metmuseum.org/mymetmuseum</a>)</li>
      <li> the J. Paul Getty Museum<br />
        (Getty Bookmarks, <a href="../http://www.getty.edu/mygetty" target="_blank">http://www.getty.edu/mygetty</a>)</li>
      <li>  Tate Online <br />
        (My Selection, <a
href="../http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/PersonalSelection" target="_blank">http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/PersonalSelection</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here visitors to the Web site can bookmark from the on-line collection 
      sets of favorite artworks that they can later access and update or send 
      to friends and family. In some cases, these personal digital collections 
      can be accompanied by images and annotated with personal comments. See Figure 
      1 for an example from the Virtual Museums of Canada. </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a><img src="filippini-fantoni.fig1.jpg" alt="Fig 1: An example of an annotated personal collection from the Virtual Museum of Canada." width="400" height="342" border="0" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 1: An example of an annotated personal collection from the Virtual 
      Museum of Canada.</p>
    <p>These tools are particularly useful for people using on-line digital collection 
      information for research and educational purposes. Teachers, for example, 
      can select and print out a list of artifacts for the visit, set up study 
      sets, provide personalized recommendations and/or test the knowledge acquired 
      during the visit by asking their students to create personal exhibitions. 
      On-line bookmarks can also be of support to those wishing to carefully plan 
      their trip to the museum. The Getty and Tate on-line bookmarking systems, 
      for example, allow on-line visitors to create a printable map of the selected 
      artworks in preparation for an eventual visit, as shown in Figure 2. </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a><img src="filippini-fantoni.fig2.jpg" alt="Fig 2: Printable map of the Getty Villa from Getty Bookmarks." width="400" height="211" border="0" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2: Printable map of the Getty Villa from Getty Bookmarks.</p>
    <p>On-site at the museum, dedicated computer kiosks can also offer bookmarking 
      facilities. One of the first examples was the <em>Make your own gallery</em> 
      kiosk that premiered at the SFMOMA San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's 
      <em>Points of Departure</em> exhibition (<a
href="../http://www.sfmoma.org/exhibitions/exhib_detail.asp?id=58" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org/exhibitions/exhib_detail.asp?id=58</a>) 
      in Spring 2001 (Bowen &amp; Filippini-Fantoni, 2004). This allowed anyone 
      to &quot;bookmark&quot; images of the exhibition's art pieces into a virtual 
      on-screen gallery and add their own commentary. More recently (2005), the 
      J. Paul Getty Museum developed a series of multimedia kiosks (GettyGuide 
      - see Figure 3 and <a
href="../http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide" target="_blank">http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide</a>; 
      Filippini-Fantoni, 2006b) available both at the Getty Center and the Getty 
      Villa. These allow visitors to save content of interest (videos, descriptions 
      of artworks, artist biographies). Visitors can then either send the saved 
      information to their email addresses or access it on a personal Web page 
      created on the museum's Web site. Similarly, the National Gallery's Art 
      Start kiosks within the gallery in London include an &quot;add it to My 
      Tour&quot; feature that allows visitors to bookmark objects of interest. 
      These bookmarks can then be sent via e-mail and/or printed out so visitors 
      can find them more easily during the visit (Filippini-Fantoni, 2006a).</p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a><img src="filippini-fantoni.fig3.jpg" alt="Fig 3: A screenshot of the GettyGuide kiosk showing the bookmarking feature at the bottom." width="400" height="300" border="0" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 3: A screenshot of the GettyGuide kiosk showing the bookmarking feature 
      at the bottom.</p>
    <p>Analogous applications are also available in different science museums, 
      where the use of interactive kiosks in the exhibition space is more common. 
      The Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, for example, successfully uses 
      RFID-tagged tickets to allow its visitors to bookmark images, videos, lab 
      tests and games' results. (RFID - Radio Frequency identification is a generic 
      term for technology that uses radio waves to identify objects automatically. 
      In this case, the system is used to identify individual visitors who wear 
      the RFID tagged ticket as a wristband and use it as an identifier every 
      time they need to bookmark information from one of the kiosks.) The content 
      saved by the visitors during their interaction with the museum's numerous 
      kiosks can then be accessed on the museum Web site after the visit via the 
      number that is indicated on the RFID tickets. Such tools can also be used 
      for educational purposes in the context of a school visit.</p>
    <p>As an example, the marine science education centre at the Gulf of Maine 
      Research Institute (GMRI, <a href="../http://www.gma.org/" target="_blank">http://www.gma.org</a>) 
      in Portland, Maine, allows 5th and 6th grade students to save the observations, 
      hypotheses, evidence and findings collected during their interaction with 
      the museum installations and interactives to individual science notebooks 
      which they and their teachers and parents can access at school or home on 
      the institution Web site. On their personal sites, students can annotate, 
      update and export all of their digital movies and images to create additional 
      extended research reports.</p>
    <p>In more recent times, bookmarking has also been extended to mobile technology 
      that accompanies visitors through the galleries, capturing spontaneous interests 
      and bursts of curiosity so that visitors can follow up on what caught their 
      imagination. Increasingly, handheld devices including bookmarking facilities 
      are now used in larger museums to provide visitors with audiovisual information 
      about exhibits. One of the most successful examples of this type of application 
      is the Multimedia Tour (<a
href="../http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/multimediatour" target="_blank">http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/multimediatour</a>) 
      for the permanent collection at Tate Modern, developed in cooperation with 
      Antenna Audio. The Multimedia Tour, which provides rich and captivating 
      audio-visual information about the collection, allows the visitor to e-mail 
      home links to the museum Web site for more detailed information on artworks 
      of interest.</p>
    <p>Like the Tate Modern tour, the handheld guide offered by the Boston Museum 
      of Science for the temporary Star Wars exhibition (2005-2006, <a
href="../http://www.mos.org/exhibits_shows/exhibit_archive&amp;d=729" target="_blank">http://www.mos.org/exhibits_shows/exhibit_archive&amp;d=729</a>), 
      allowed visitors to bookmark information of interest for later use at home 
      (Reich &amp; Chin, 2006). However in this case, the visitor, instead of 
      receiving an e-mail with links to the on-line collection information, was 
      given access to a personal page, created on the museum Web site, with additional 
      information about the bookmarked items. See Figure 4 for the Star Wars example 
      from the Museum of Science in Boston and Figure 5 for an example from the 
      Tate Modern Multimedia Tour in London.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="filippini-fantoni.fig4.jpg" alt="Fig 4: Screenshot from the Tate Modern Multimedia Tour, showing the bookmarking feature." width="400" height="532" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 4: Screenshot from the Tate Modern Multimedia Tour, showing the bookmarking

    <p class="caption">Fig 5: Screenshot from the Star Wars Multimedia Tour at the Boston Museum 
      of Science, showing the bookmarking feature.</p>
    <p>Among the different types of mobile technologies (MP3 players, iPods, handheld 
      devices) used in museums to provide gallery interpretation, mobile phones 
      including bookmarking functionalities are also gaining momentum, especially 
      because of the visitors' familiarity with the device. <em>My Art Space</em> 
      (<a href="../http://www.myartspace.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.myartspace.org.uk</a>), 
      for example, is a UK project that allows students on a school visit to one 
      of the three museums participating to the program (D-Day Museum in Portsmouth, 
      Urbis in Manchester and the Study Gallery in Poole), to discover, &quot;collect&quot; 
      and annotate information about viewed objects on a mobile phone distributed 
      before the visit. After the trip, students and teachers can retrieve the 
      bookmarked information on the <em>My Art Space</em> Web site. The idea is 
      to encourage young people and general visitors to explore and &quot;acquire&quot; 
      cultural artifacts, curate their own virtual galleries, and construct personal 
      narratives to share with the general public as well as their family and 
      friends. </p>

    <h1>Bookmarking: Does it Really Work?</h1>
    <p>As we have seen from the examples above, since the late 1990s museums have 
      introduced bookmarking on PDAs, kiosks, and the Web in the hope that it 
      will help prolong the museum experience, build stronger relationships with 
      visitors, and facilitate learning. However, despite its great potential, 
      there is still very little evidence that bookmarking actually works in the 
      terms envisaged by its promulgators. </p>
    <p>To resolve this question, we will analyze usage statistics and evaluation 
      results of some of the projects mentioned above, carried out in part by 
      the authors and in part by museums themselves. In particular, we will consider 
      case studies from Tate Modern, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Museum of Science 
      in Boston, The Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, the Cleveland Museum of Art, 
      the Science Museum in London, and the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose. 
      We are particularly grateful to these institutions for their cooperation 
      in sharing the results of their evaluations and in allowing us to conduct 
      further research on their existing projects. The data, despite being limited 
      in size, give a good indication of the trends, problems and possible solutions 
      related to the use of bookmarking in museum throughout the different types 
      of platforms.</p>
    <p>Besides these few case studies, however, we have found it quite difficult 
      to collect useful feedback about bookmarking projects. In fact, most systems 
      are not set up to track what users do and when they do it; they do not necessarily 
      collect useful information such as number of unique visitors, first time 
      versus repeat visitors, the number of bookmarked items, etc. Moreover, in 
      order to assess the effectiveness of these tools, log data analysis is often 
      not enough to understand the rationale behind certain user behaviors. Qualitative 
      research in the form of focus groups, usability testing, interviews and 
      questionnaires are of fundamental importance to shed some light on the how 
      and the why of bookmarking. Unfortunately this type of research often requires 
      competences, time and money that most museums do not have or do not wish 
      to invest in what is often considered a low priority area.</p>
    <h2>Do Bookmarking Applications Meet Museums' Expectations<strong>?</strong></h2>
    <p>In the following we discuss the overall results rather than the mass of 
      data concerning bookmarking collected for individual museums in the projects 
      mentioned above. The figures suggest that bookmarking rates can be quite 
      variable. However, except for a few success cases, such as Tate Modern and 
      the Tech Museum of Innovation (both around 40% usage), the majority of the 
      projects lag well behind museums' expectations. (Please note that the 40% 
      figure is not relative to the total number of visitors, but to the number 
      of people using a PDA in the first case and receiving a RFID-tagged ticket 
      in the second case.)</p>
    <p>The more disappointing ones are on-line applications, which seem to suffer 
      from the general lack of visibility on museum Web sites. The Getty's on-line 
      bookmarking system (Getty Bookmarks), for example, which is buried deep 
      down in the secondary pages of the museum's Web site, registered only a 
      total of 1,969 accounts between January and December 2005 (see column V 
      in Table 2 below). This is a very small figure when compared to the total 
      number of unique visitors to the Web site (column I) or the number of unique 
      visitors to the on-line collection (column II), where the bookmarking feature 
      is hosted.</p>

    <p class="caption">Table 2: Log data from the Getty Web site.</p>
    <p>Similar results apply to the Cleveland Museum of Art with only 700 registered 
      collections over a little less than two years (September 2004 - April 2006) 
      and the Peabody Essex Museum, with 6,200 registered users between June 2003 
      and April 2006. (More insight into on-line bookmarking and personal digital 
      collections will be the object of a separate study with Professor Paul Marty 
      of Florida State University.)</p>
    <p>Kiosk-based solutions seem to perform slightly better than on-line applications 
      with bookmarking rates ranging between 6% (GettyGuide - Filippini-Fantoni, 
      S., 2006b)  and 40% (Tech Tag - averaged over three years). Similarly, 
      bookmarking rates on handheld devices are also quite variable, ranging between 
      10% (Star Wars exhibition - Reich &amp; Chin, 2006) and 43% (Tate Modern). 
    </p>
    <p>Click through rates, which indicate the percentage of users that follow 
      up and go on-line to access the bookmarked information, are even more disappointing 
      than the bookmarking rates. With the exception of Tate Modern, with a 44% 
      click-through rate in the summer of 2005 (19% of the total number of PDA 
      users), all the other projects are well below 10%. The Star Wars Multimedia 
      Tour at the Boston Museum of Science, which was very similar to the Tate 
      Modern application, only had a 10% click-through rate, which corresponds 
      to 3.7% of the total number of PDA users (Reich &amp; Chin, 2006). </p>
    <p><em>In Touch</em> (Bowen &amp; Filippini-Fantoni, 2004; <a
href="../http://www.sciencemuseumintouch.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.sciencemuseumintouch.org.uk</a>), 
      a kiosk-based bookmarking system available as part of an interactive exhibit 
      at the Welcome Wing of the London Science Museum since 2000 had an average 
      8% click-through rate in 2004, similar to the 7% average obtained by the 
      Tech Tag RFID-based system (17.25% of the 40% bookmarkers). In the case 
      of the GettyGuide kiosks, the click-through rates drop even lower, ranging 
      between 0.22% and 2.6% of the total number of kiosk users, depending on 
      the period considered (Filippini-Fantoni, S., 2006b).</p>
    <h2>Why Are Visitors Not Bookmarking?</h2>
    <p>The results described above, apart from a few exceptions, are often considered 
      disappointing by museums. In fact, such low response rates make it very 
      difficult for them to justify a continued investment by their sponsors, 
      and often result in cancellation. The Star Wars Multimedia Tour, for example, 
      has been confirmed for the traveling version of the exhibition, but no bookmarking 
      tool will be provided. The reasons indicated for the choice are high costs 
      (to set up a wireless network or a hotspot solution in the museums included 
      in the exhibition tour) and low response rates. In the next section of this 
      paper we will try to challenge this idea of failure, but for now let us 
      try to understand the reasons for this apparent lack of success. </p>
    <p>First, the majority of the public does not seem to be very interested in 
      bookmarking. At Tate Modern, for example, PDA users indicated &quot;lack 
      of interest and time&quot; among the main reasons for not bookmarking. &quot;<em>It 
      makes sense here,</em>&quot; commented one of the respondents. &quot;<em>I 
      don't feel the need for more information at home and if I did I'd go to 
      the Web site and look it up on my own.</em>&quot; Similar responses were 
      provided by participants to the GettyGuide evaluation, where 21% of the 
      users indicated that they were not interested in the bookmarking feature, 
      while 17.4% did not have the time to use it (Filippini-Fantoni, S., 2006b).</p>
    <p>Similarly, PDA users at the Star Wars exhibition declared that they were 
      not interested in the feature (9%), did not have time (9%), or did not like 
      receiving an e-mail (7% - Reich &amp; Chin, 2006). These types of responses 
      seem to suggest that, for most visitors, the experience starts and finishes 
      at the museum and there is no need or curiosity to extend it beyond its 
      walls. Moreover, in a society where people are constantly exposed to educational 
      and visual content, fear of junk e-mail and information overload also represent 
      a serious obstacle to the use of bookmarking in museums.</p>
    <p>Besides the general lack of interest and time and a fear of information 
      overload, outlined above, there seem to be other factors behind the fairly 
      poor response rates witnessed by bookmarking tools. One of them is the lack 
      of visibility, which appears to be a major problem, especially for on-line 
      applications that are usually hidden in secondary pages of museum Web sites. 
      For example, none of the participants in a teachers' workshop at the Getty 
      Villa (see below) was aware of the existence of the on-line (Getty Bookmarks) 
      bookmarking features, despite visiting the Web site quite regularly (Filippini-Fantoni, 
      S., 2006b). This point is particularly important, as very little visibility 
      has been given so far to the Getty Bookmarks, particularly on-line. Even 
      searching for relevant keywords using Google can give poor results, and 
      museums could learn to benefit more from search engines in this regard (Numerico 
      et al., 2005).</p>
    <p>Despite its potential as an educational tool, <em>My Getty Bookmarks</em> 
      is, in fact, buried deep down in the art section of the Web site, where 
      it has been recently removed from the secondary menu. When asked why they 
      visited the Getty museum Web site, most of the 17 (out of 32) teachers who 
      had been on-line claimed that they mainly used it to plan a school visit, 
      or look for lessons plans as well as information about artwork/artist/exhibitions. 
      This suggests that besides the art section, the bookmarking feature should 
      be advertised in the education section of the site, where most teachers 
      are likely to go to plan a museum visit, as well as on the home page (Filippini-Fantoni, 
      S., 2006b).</p>
    <p>Kiosk and PDA-based bookmarking tools seem to suffer from a similar fate: 
      23% of the participants in the Star Wars Multimedia Tour evaluation indicated 
      that they were not aware of the existence of the tool, despite being given 
      a full description of the device's functionalities by the distribution staff 
      (Reich &amp; Chin, 2006). Similarly, 57% of the visitors to The Tech, even 
      when using the RFID tagged ticket, are not aware of the existence of the 
      Web site and therefore are not able to follow up on their visit by accessing 
      the bookmarked content on-line.</p>
    <p>This suggests that museums should put more effort into advertising their 
      bookmarking features, both on-line and onsite, to make sure that as many 
      visitors as possible are aware of their existence and know how to use them. 
      Advertising them on all museum brochures, the Web site, introductory videos 
      and audio-guides is of fundamental importance to spread awareness. A key 
      role in this respect must be played by the on-site staff giving assistance 
      to visitors while using kiosks in the gallery. Consider, for example, the 
      case of <em>Tech Tags</em> at the Tech Museum. Through better advertising, 
      staff training and a more effective tag distribution policy, the bookmarking 
      and click-through rates have considerably increased in the past three years, 
      raising respectively from 28% (bookmarking rate) and 12% (click-though rate) 
      in 2004 to 54% (bookmarking rate) and 21% (click-though rate) in 2006. </p>
    <p>Another key factor in improving the success rate of these applications 
      is to make them as transparent, intuitive and easy to use as possible, unfortunately 
      very often not the case. The most enlightening example, in this respect, 
      is the bookmarking application of the GettyGuide kiosks, where 35.6% of 
      the non-bookmarkers indicated that they did not notice the feature, despite 
      it being available on each screen, while another 19.6% did not understand 
      what facility was being provided (Filippini-Fantoni, S., 2006b).</p>
    <p>In order to determine the real nature of the problems, the museum carried 
      out task-based usability tests with seven GettyGuide users (six women and 
      one man) between the age of 14 and 70. These tests were very valuable in 
      helping the museum understand that the bookmarking functionality, as it 
      is set up now, is too complex for the user to understand without guidance 
      from museum staff. First, the word &quot;bookmark&quot; is confusing for 
      the user because it does not convey the idea that the system allows the 
      user to save information for later use at home. Moreover, the word bookmark 
      seems to prove particularly difficult for non-native speakers. Tina, for 
      example, a 44-year-old Norwegian with little computer experience and relatively 
      poor English, had no idea to what the word referred. She had never used 
      it or encountered it before.</p>
    <p>When asked what other terms the museum could use to better express the 
      fact that the system allowed the users to save information and access it 
      later at home, three out of seven respondents suggested the word &quot;e-mail&quot;. 
      Sending an e-mail is what visitors think about when wanting to retrieve 
      information of interest at home. As a matter of fact, it is something most 
      museum visitors understand, are familiar with, and have done at least once 
      in their lives. In contrast, setting up an account, which is what the system 
      here allows them to do, is somewhat less common, especially when the account 
      in question is set up on a kiosk in a museum and then accessed on-line through 
      the museum Web site (Filippini-Fantoni, S., 2006b). </p>
    <p>Problems of transparency related to the use of wrong terminology have also 
      emerged in other situations. In the case of the Tate Modern Multimedia Tour, 
      for example, the museum chose to use the expression &quot;e-mail information 
      home&quot; to indicate the possibility of bookmarking information about 
      one or more objects covered by the tour. The term is fairly self-explanatory 
      and, even when the staff does not have the time to brief the visitor in 
      detail, users can normally work out what that entails on their own. In contrast, 
      on the Star Wars multimedia tour, the term &quot;bookmark&quot; was used 
      to indicate exactly the same functionality. The result was a much lower 
      bookmarking rate (10% instead of 43%), which, even if also influenced by 
      other factors, is a proof that transparency and clarity are of fundamental 
      importance for the success of these solutions. </p>
    <p>As underlined by the various evaluations, lack of interest, visibility, 
      transparency and simplicity are the main reasons for the poor performances 
      of bookmarking tools in museums. While there is not much we can do about 
      the lack of interest, the other problems can be easily addressed, resulting 
      in improved take-up rates.</p>
    <h2>Can We Really Talk About &quot;Failure&quot;?</h2>
    <p>In the previous sections of the paper, we have seen how and why, in the 
      majority of the cases analyzed, the performance of bookmarking solutions 
      is definitely below museums' expectations. However, despite the apparently 
      disappointing results, we cannot help but wonder, is it reasonable to talk 
      about actual &quot;failure&quot;, as many museum professionals have quickly 
      insinuated, or is there &quot;another side of the coin&quot;? As may have 
      already become apparent, we are fervent believers in the second possibility, 
      for three main reasons, as discussed below.</p>
    <p>First, the data need to be analyzed in a wider context of use. If we consider 
      the Tech Museum project, for example, since its launch in 2004 over 300,000 
      the RFID tagged tickets have been used, and over 50,000 visitors have accessed 
      their bookmarked information on-line. What is also important is the percentage 
      of visitors that used the tag in more than one visit (3.2%), suggesting 
      the ability of the system not only to create continuity between the pre 
      and post-visit experience, but also to support an ongoing relationship between 
      the museum and some of its public. These numbers are quite significant if 
      compared to the success rates of other more traditional marketing or educational 
      campaigns in museums. </p>
    <p>Secondly, what it is very important to define here is not only the number 
      of visitors using the bookmarking functionalities but also how much benefit 
      these tools bring to the few visitors who are using them, especially from 
      an educational point of view. Do visitors actually learn something through 
      the process? Do they retain more information as indicated by research in 
      the cognitive science field? Unfortunately, most of the studies conducted 
      so far do not address these issues, mainly because of the difficulties inherent 
      in measuring learning over an extended period of time (during the visit 
      and after the visit) and in different locations (in the museum, at home, 
      in the classroom, etc.). However, preliminary data from the Tate Modern 
      evaluation indicate that actual learning occurs when at least the visitor 
      using the bookmarking feature is motivated by reasons other then curiosity, 
      such as interest in specific artists, research or as a teacher preparing 
      for a school visit.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, and most important, the low success rates of these applications 
      might be an indicator that, while bookmarking does not actually appeal to 
      the so-called &quot;general public&quot;, it represents a useful tool for 
      a group of committed visitors including art lovers, researchers, students, 
      teachers, second-time visitors, etc., who come to the museum with a specific 
      educational or research purpose in mind. This hypothesis is confirmed by 
      data from the evaluations of the Star Wars multimedia tour and of the GettyGuide 
      kiosks. In the first case, bookmarkers are a dedicated population: they 
      are very interested in science, are great Star Wars fans, and visit the 
      museums more often than non-bookmarkers (Reich &amp; Chin, 2006). Similarly, 
      bookmarkers using the GettyGuide kiosks are more likely to be second-time 
      visitors, to spend more time at the kiosk and to use the interactive device 
      to look up specific information about art rather than t satisfy simple curiosity.</p>
    <p>It is for this group of enthusiastic visitors that museums need to develop 
      bookmarking applications. This entails taking them and their specific needs 
      into consideration when setting up bookmarking tools, but also advertising 
      the tools through the right channels.</p>
    <h2>Bookmarking In The Classroom</h2>
    <p>A prime example is that of teachers, one of the categories of visitor that 
      is more likely to take advantage of bookmarking applications. Research conducted 
      by one of the authors at the Getty Villa with a group of 32 (K-12) teachers 
      seems to confirm their general interest in using the bookmarking functionality 
      (particularly the on-line version) before, during and after the visit to 
      support classroom activities (Filippini-Fantoni, S., 2006b).</p>
    <p>With the exception of only a couple of teachers who did not feel comfortable 
      using technology in the classroom, most of the respondents seemed enthusiastic 
      about bookmarking and eager to use it for different purposes: &quot;<em>Possibilities 
      are endless. It is an amazing feature. I'm excited to use it!</em>&quot; 
      remarked Julie, a 6<sup>th</sup> grade teacher. And again: &quot;<em>Exciting 
      idea!!</em>&quot; commented another 6<sup>th</sup> grade teacher. </p>
    <p>For most respondents, the main reason for wanting to use on-line bookmarking 
      is to plan and to prepare for a museum visit: &quot;<em>It is great to be 
      able to make our own tour to follow or to go over specific pieces before 
      our visit to the museum</em>,&quot; commented Lara, another 6<sup>th</sup> 
      grade teacher. By allowing teachers to select specific artworks from the 
      on-line collection, &quot;<em>Getty Bookmarks can make the preparation and 
      organization of a study trip easier and the tour more meaningful for the 
      students</em>.&quot; The importance of having a tool that helps students 
      develop &quot;personal connections&quot; with the works of art they are 
      going to see in the museum is of fundamental importance for educators. A 
      6<sup>th</sup> grade teacher from the Topanga Canyon area, for example, 
      commented: &quot;<em>I hope to get my students to look closely at ceramics 
      so when they come to the museum they will have a personal connection</em>.&quot; 
      Another<span class=MsoCommentReference> </span>6<sup>th</sup> grade teacher 
      added: &quot;<em>I can definitely see myself using these tools for helping 
      the kids have a visual connection. It can help students get a much better 
      understanding. It helps bring the information alive</em>&quot;. </p>
    <p>In the hope of helping to create excitement and familiarization with the 
      exhibited objects, teachers envisaged using bookmarks in PowerPoint to prepare 
      presentations or slideshows, to create lessons plans and curricula, as well 
      as to initiate discussion about artworks before the visit: &quot;<em>We 
      can use them as a classroom project; students can work in groups to create 
      a PowerPoint project to show what is available or what they are interested 
      in studying. They can also see in detail all the pieces that they are interested 
      in learning about</em>,&quot; commented a 6<sup>th</sup> grade teacher. 
    </p>
    <p>Besides helping them to prepare, bookmarks can support teachers during 
      their actual museum visits. Maps of selected artworks can be printed out 
      and distributed to students who can look for their favorite objects and 
      &quot; <em>practice map reading skills</em>.&quot; Another interesting way 
      teachers envisaged using bookmarks at the museum is to create worksheets 
      with artworks on view, including a space for annotation, where children 
      can write their comments or notes during the visit. In a similar fashion, 
      bookmarks can be used to set up scavenger hunts, assigning different groups 
      of children sets of artworks and questions to which they need to find answers. 
      Bookmarks can easily turn the museum visit into something not only educational 
      but also enjoyable for the children. However, in order to support these 
      functions, it is important that bookmarking systems allow for multiple collections 
      (under the same username), annotation, and readable  printing. </p>
    <p>Another sought-after scenario in which teachers envisioned using the on-line 
      and on-site bookmarking feature is to allow students to follow up at home 
      or in the classroom on what caught their attention during the visit. &quot;<em>Students 
      can</em> <em>revisit the works they have seen in the museum at home with 
      their parents or as part of a homework assignment</em>,&quot; remarked Nina, 
      a 5<sup>th</sup> grade teacher. &quot;<em>After the actual trip they could 
      then use the information to tell others about their experience</em>,&quot; 
      added another respondent (an 8<sup>th</sup> grade teacher). </p>
    <p>The easiest way for students to share their experience with others is to 
      &quot;create their own collections of favorite artworks enriched with comments 
      and annotations that they can then publish or send to friends and family,&quot; 
      said a 6<sup>th</sup> grade teacher. Similarly, younger children can use 
      the list of bookmarks to create &quot;personal coloring books enriched with 
      stories that they can then take home and share with their parents,&quot; 
      added a 1<sup>st</sup> grade teacher.</p>
    <p>The list of bookmarks can also be used to both &quot;<em>evaluate the knowledge 
      acquired during the visit by the students and to allow for further research 
      on specific artworks</em>,&quot; commented another 6<sup>th</sup> grade 
      teacher. To all intents and purposes, the fact that an important part of 
      the content concerning the museum visit can be made accessible at home or 
      in another context allows the visitor to focus more on discovery and the 
      aesthetic experience while in the museum, and to leave the more traditional 
      didactic aspects for later, as underlined by one of the respondents. &quot;<em>It 
      could help me to focus my students' interest on the visit and provide background 
      knowledge upon which to scaffold,</em>&quot; said an 8<sup>th</sup> grade 
      teacher. Further, &quot;<em>they love to hear the stories, so I can share 
      my bookmarks with them</em>.&quot;</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>This paper has covered the use of &quot;bookmarking&quot; in museums using 
      the results from a number of case studies to evaluate the benefits and weaknesses 
      of the approach. On the surface, the take-up of bookmarking could be deemed 
      to be disappointing. However, it seems likely that a small but important 
      core of visitors find such facilities extremely worthwhile. For example, 
      teachers can benefit hugely in the use of such facilities to prepare for 
      and aid a school visit. At the J. Paul Getty Museum, the teachers' enthusiasm 
      for the Getty bookmarking tool is excellent proof that, when targeted to 
      the right audience, these tools can represent a significant added value 
      for the community. </p>
    <p>Bearing this in mind, museums should on the one hand try to reduce their 
      expectations about the usage of these tools, by setting more realistic targets, 
      and on the other hand aim to maximize their impact by improving their visibility 
      as well as their interface design. Ensuring that visitors realize the facilities 
      exist and exactly what they provide could improve take-up significantly. 
      For example, many visitors, especially those with English as a second language, 
      find the term &quot;bookmarking&quot; confusing. It appears that more familiar 
      terms, like &quot;e-mail&quot;, would help in making it obvious to visitors 
      what the facility provides, without the necessity of having it explained 
      by museum personnel.</p>
    <p>For the future, it will be desirable to promote more qualitative evaluation 
      in museums and more academic research. This could help to better define 
      the usage framework for these tools and to clarify the long term benefits 
      these will bring to the museums and their visitors. In summary, despite 
      an apparent slow initial take-up in general, we believe there is a future 
      for bookmarking in museums provided that it is marketed correctly, targeted 
      appropriately, and made easier to use without explanation.</p>
