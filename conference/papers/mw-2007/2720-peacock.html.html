				<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
				<p class="abstract">How we think about our users shapes the Web spaces we
				  create and their purpose, design, content and functionality. The ways we
				  think about users are an implicit but often unexplored part of planning
				  and managing museum Web sites. However, perhaps it is time we examined
				  these assumptions more closely and directly.</p>
				<p class="abstract">Recent research presented at this conference identified
				  a number of problem areas in defining and categorising users of digital

				  outcomes. In the absence of an e-commerce bottom line and with often ambitious
				  social agendas for education and access, museum Web sites suffer from a
				  lack of tangible success measures.</p>
				<p class="abstract">Yet at the heart of these frustrations seem to be our

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Whenever we consider the value of the on-line content and
        experiences we create, the question of &lsquo;value to whom?&rsquo; immediately arises.
        Is it value to ourselves, our institutions, or to an amorphous &lsquo;other&rsquo;? What
        do we imagine, know and believe about those unseen others: the individuals
        and groups who search out and make use of our on-line offerings? What is
        the nature of the value that we seek to create for them?</p>
      <p>In planning any new project, or in evaluating an existing
        one, we proceed from certain often unstated assumptions and theories which
        define not only how we design and build Web sites, but how we measure our
        success.</p>
      <p>In this paper we examine the origins of some common conceptualisations
        of those people &lsquo;out there&rsquo; at the other end of our Web sites and suggest
        some different ways for thinking about their Web use and the value we might
        create for them. We argue that some established concepts of
        &lsquo;audience&rsquo; are neither relevant nor useful in the contemporary on-line environment.
        In fact, we suggest that a new approach in conceptualising museum Web site
        use is required if we are seriously interested in meeting their needs and
        effectively driving and documenting our successes. We believe that this new
        conceptualisation has important implications for how we approach the planning,
        design, marketing, usability and evaluation of museum Web sites.</p>
      <p>So just who and what are we talking about? <em>Audiences,
      visitors, users</em>: these terms are sprinkled throughout our project proposals,
      marketing plans and evaluations. They are often used interchangeably. We
      all have an easy familiarity with these terms and seem to understand what
      each term means, as well as their close associates: markets, customers,
      communities and publics. Or do we? </p>
      <p>Recent research presented at this conference has identified
        a number of problem areas in defining and categorising users of digital cultural
        content (Dawson et al. 2004). Based on a survey of user evaluation research
        conducted for the Cultural Content Forum, Dawson et al. found a lack of consistent
        practice and standards in respect of user profiling and performance measurement.
        Similarly, based on a series of interviews with museum Web practitioners,
        Michael and Kate Haley Goldman reported the shared perception that there
        is a &ldquo;lack of true connection with the virtual user [which] has handicapped
        the evolution&rdquo; of museum Web practice (Haley Goldman, Haley Goldman 2005).</p>
      <p>In this paper we pose several questions. <em>How</em> and <em>how
      well</em> do we know the museum Web site user? Is what we think we know
      based on solid foundations? Do the lenses through which we view Web site
      users get in the way of truly knowing them? What choices do we have in
      understanding our site users, and which will serve us, and them, best?</p>
      <p>In the first part of this paper we bring forward for conscious
        examination some of the implicit assumptions and beliefs embedded within
        our constructs of audiences, visitors and users. In the second part we suggest
        some new conceptualisations for understanding museum Web site use that may
        help us to focus more clearly on knowing the people &lsquo;out there&rsquo; and meeting
        their needs.</p>
      <p>Finally, we show how these understandings have been applied
        in the planning process for a major Web site redevelopment project underway
        at Australia&rsquo;s largest museum, Museum Victoria, in Melbourne, Victoria. </p>
      <h2>Know Thy User, Know Thyself</h2>
      <p>Whether we call it market research, evaluation or usability
        testing, all these research and validation activities rely on our assumptions
        and expectations about the people who use our products. None of this information
        is without its own core assumptions and biases.</p>
      <p>Recently deceased guru of non-profit marketing Peter Drucker
        wryly observed the following &lsquo;realities&rsquo; in any rigorous marketing analysis:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>that &ldquo;what
          the people in the business think they know about customer and market is more
        likely to be wrong than right&rdquo;</li>
    <li>that &ldquo;the
      customer rarely buys what the business thinks it sells&rdquo;
      and that</li>
    <li>businesses &ldquo;rarely
      adequately define what and whom [they are] really competing with.&rdquo; (Drucker,
      1996)</li>
	    </ul>
      <p>Drucker&rsquo;s observations remind us to critically examine our
        own assumptions and beliefs if we really want to understand and meet the
        needs of our Web site users.</p>
      <h2>Four Paradigms Don&rsquo;t Make A Whole</h2>
      <p>As we see it, the study of museum Web site users is caught
        in a confusion of paradigms. Whenever we talk about the people who might
        and do access our on-line content and services, we tend to use, sometimes
        interchangeably, the terminology, constructs and values from at least four
        different paradigms. Audience and visitor studies, marketing, evaluation
        and usability analysis have each informed the discussion of museum Web site
        use to varying degrees.</p>
      <p>These paradigms each hail from rather different traditions
        and perspectives: from the social and communication sciences, from economics
        and from software engineering. In terms of their core assumptions, epistemologies
        and methodological approaches, they are all quite distinct. And  each
        also comes with its own prejudices and blind spots. </p>
      <p>All of these perspectives pre-date the advent of the Web.
        They have been appropriated for the study of Web site use in what seems to
        be a rather arbitrary fashion, without much regard to their suitability and
        adequacy. Further, indiscriminate mixing of elements from each of the paradigms
        not only adds to the confusion, but also prevents us from building a sustainable
        body of knowledge about museum Web site users. This confusion results in
        research and analysis in the form of inconsistently modeled snapshots of
        what is happening on-line. Despite the large amount of effort going into
        user research over more than a decade, we still have a very fragmented understanding
        of users and the
        &lsquo;user experience&rsquo; on museum Web sites.</p>
      <p>One can usually recognise where each of the paradigms is
        being used by its language and point of view. The term &lsquo;audience&rsquo; suggests
        a subject population, waiting, perhaps eagerly, for something which they
        can attend. &lsquo;Audience studies&rsquo; hail from the heyday of broadcast mass media,
        when radio and television held sway. The &lsquo;audience&rsquo; construct suggests something
        passive, able to resist perhaps, but not able to ignore media messages and
        agendas. It represents the worldview of the &lsquo;unassailable voice&rsquo; of institutional
        power and authority so well described by Walsh (1997).</p>
      <p>More typically, however, museums have conceptualised their
        focus as &ldquo;visitors&rdquo;, those individuals and groups who attend
        museums and galleries as a recreational or educational choice. In this
        conception, the visitor is regarded as having made a conscious choice
        to engage with the museum, the &lsquo;free-choice learners&rsquo; described
        by Dierking and Falk (1998). Even as &lsquo;virtual visitors&rsquo; they
        have the status of &lsquo;honoured guests&rsquo; (Streten,
        2000) rather than a captive and subject population. The visitor studies
        paradigm shows a fondness for ethnographic approaches to studying visitor &lsquo;behaviour&rsquo;<em> in
          situ</em>, eschewing the tower of authority for a more discreet observation
        point within a gallery space, or from behind the interviewer&rsquo;s
        clipboard or one-way glass.</p>
      <p>In contrast, market research takes as its starting point
        the consumer paradigm, where all people are customers, satisfying endless
        needs and wants through purchases or less tangible cultural &lsquo;consumption&rsquo;.
        This perspective typically relies on a behaviourist model of stimulus and
        response, engineering predictable results through manipulation of variables
        such as price, promotion and packaging. The marketing perspective seeks out
        data on supposed predictors of behaviour: demographics, psychographics, and
        purchasing activity. It also uses surveys of competitors and prospective
        consumers to identify market &lsquo;gaps&rsquo; and opportunities.</p>
      <p>Usability analysis emerged from an engineering and design
        perspective, where the user is conceived of as an active agent pursuing
        task-based goals. The user (or a surrogate) provides the point of validation
        for a software product&rsquo;s efficiency and fitness for use. User-centred
        design (UCD) is particularly concerned with matching software or Web
        site functioning and design to the cognitive abilities and processes
        of the imagined end user. A range of methods has been developed for &lsquo;testing&rsquo; usability,
        the most common being &lsquo;expert-focused&rsquo; where
        the product&rsquo;s usability is assessed by engineers, and &lsquo;user-focused&rsquo; where
        actual or projected end users perform that task (Harms, Schweibenz, 2001).</p>
      <p>Finally, the fourth paradigm of evaluation originated in
        the social sciences, particularly for the purpose of examining the efficiency
        and effectiveness of government programs. Museum evaluation practice has
        assimilated many of the traditions of the education sector, with a particular
        focus on defining and monitoring learning outcomes. In the evaluation paradigm,
        the user is typically represented as a client or citizen recipient of government
        sponsored interventions.</p>
      <p>Each of these different but sometimes overlapping constructions
        of the user has been represented in the review and evaluation activities
        reported at this conference.</p>
      <p>While each of these paradigms may be valid within its own
        terms, together do they amount to a complete picture of what is happening
        with museum Web sites? We suggest that each contributes only a partial view,
        seldom learning from or joining with other perspectives. What is required
        is a model that more thoroughly integrates these perspectives and draws on
        the best of what they have to offer in terms of research methods and actionable
        knowledge. Before suggesting what such a model might look like, we will discuss
        some of the problematics arising in the use of existing paradigms for the
        analysis of museum Web users: first, the audience myth, then the use of marketing
        concepts in museums and the problem of creating usable usability analyses.</p>
      <p>What we propose is a better integrated model for planning,
        research and evaluation, one that avoids some of the pitfalls and inherent
        limitations of each paradigm and one which links those perspectives into
        a more a holistic view.</p>
      <h3>The Audience Myth</h3>
      <p>Eilean Hooper-Greenhill, writing in the context of the physical
        museum, defines <em>audiences</em> as &ldquo;all those who might come, if the experience
        were judged (by them) to be worthwhile&rdquo; in contrast to <em>visitors</em> whom
        she defines as &ldquo;those who will actually come&rdquo; (Hooper-Greenhill, 1994). This
        is a common enough distinction, when the terms are in fact differentiated
        and not used interchangeably. The idea of an audience as a vast pool of individuals
        waiting to be persuaded of the merits of becoming a visitor is a powerful
        and pervasive one in the museum domain. But when we consider it in the context
        of the on-line &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; museum, it is of little practical use and prevents
        us from better understanding the needs, motivations and expectations of museum
        Web site users.</p>
      <p>The potential audience for an on-line offering is anyone
        who might actually see it, which effectively means anyone who uses the Internet,
        at last count more than one billion people worldwide (Internet World Stats,
        2007).  It is no longer possible to make meaningful assertions about such
        a large and heterogeneous group. Even within a single developed nation, such
        as Australia or the United States, the Internet is now used by 70% of the
        population (Internet World Stats, 2007). In these countries at least, Internet
        users are becoming more and more typical of the general population.</p>
      <p>The idea of audience was a staple of twentieth century communications
        theorists in their analysis of the so-called &lsquo;media effects&rsquo; of mass communications
        media such as newspapers, radio and television. Yet, as Livingstone (2004)
        suggests, as we move beyond the broadcast era into one of hybrid and interactive
        media forms, the concept of  audience starts to look obsolete. Content, networks
        and devices are too various and their users too empowered to connect, create
        and exchange to talk about a mass market for Web site offerings.</p>
      <p>With broadcast media, the choice of the public was simply
        to watch or not to watch. Even then, as media communication theorists discovered,
        broadcast &lsquo;audiences&rsquo; were far more active in how they &lsquo;consumed&rsquo; media programming,
        constructing their own meanings and uses. With interactive on-line media,
        as the Web 2.0 phenomena amply demonstrates, the Internet is moving to a
        more participative model (Carey, Jeffrey, 2006) where, as the Economist recently
        noted, &ldquo;the boundaries between audiences and creators become blurred and
        often invisible&rdquo; (The Economist, 2006).</p>
      <p>The audience concept is an anachronism in the on-line world.
        Instead we need to use concepts with a sharper focus to advance our understanding
        of Web site users. Using the term &lsquo;visitor&rsquo; as a surrogate, blanket term
        for audience will not help either. As Ken Hamma has pointed out,
        &ldquo;There is no such thing as a general visitor, no such thing as someone just
        browsing through the on-line collections. In fact, we realized that using
        the term &lsquo;general visitor&rsquo; mainly let us avoid defining the group&rdquo; (Hamma
        2004).</p>
      <p>If we are to fully acknowledge the agency of our Web site
        users, we need to define their visiting more purposively. We need to understand
        their visiting in terms of its own purposes, not simply as a record of our
        own achievement. In many &lsquo;visitor studies&rsquo; of museum Web site users, there
        is too much emphasis on who they are and too little on what they want and
        do on-line and the context in which they do it.</p>
      <p>Of course museums have long had their own tradition of viewing
        audiences as a malleable social mass and of measuring their success in terms
        of reach and participation. Nineteenth century models of social improvement
        for the masses &ndash; the education and elevation of public taste &ndash;
        underpin the concept of a museum &lsquo;audience&rsquo;, a captive, if recalcitrant,
        horde in need of education and instruction. </p>
      <p>The contemporary catchcry of &ldquo;audience development&rdquo; &ndash; for
        the physical museum and its on-line counterpart &ndash; is an echo of these assumptions
        and preoccupations. In recent years, particularly in the United Kingdom under
        New Labour, cultural policy and significant institutional resources have
        been dedicated to &lsquo;audience development&rsquo; &ldquo;as a tool for achieving wider social
        inclusion&rdquo; according to Hayes and Slater (2002). These researchers call into
        question the efficacy of this &lsquo;missionary approach&rsquo; and its effects in distracting
        attention from understanding and serving the needs of those already attending
        museums. </p>
      <p>In a Web context, &lsquo;audience development,&rsquo; however worthy
        its intentions, is equally misguided. A Web audience cannot be developed.
        There is no &lsquo;audience&rsquo; for Web sites, simply people who use the Web for their
        own purposes. The audience framework obscures this fact and sidesteps the
        question of what those purposes are and how they are pursued.</p>
      <h2>The Marketing Problem In Museums</h2>
      <p>Liss Jeffrey (1994) identified two basic research approaches
        in the study of &lsquo;audiences&rsquo; within cultural industries, <em>a cultural approach</em> &ldquo;where
        audiences are assumed to be composed of citizens, or members of the general
        public&rdquo; as we have just discussed, and <em>an economic or market model </em>where
        &ldquo;audiences are assumed to be consumers who make up potential or actual markets&rdquo;
        (Jeffrey, 1994: 2).  Just as the &lsquo;public as audience&rsquo; has proven an elusive
        and perhaps illusory concept for museums, the assimilation of principles,
        practices and perspectives from marketing has also proved problematic.</p>
      <p>Marketing concepts came to prominence in museums in the
        1980&rsquo;s. Tobelem (1997) attributes their introduction to four factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Growth
        of museums</li>
    <li>Financial
      pressures</li>
    <li>Competitive
      environment</li>
    <li>The
      need to know visitors better</li>
	    </ul>
      <p>Yet, as McPherson (2006) observes, the move to a greater
        market orientation with a focus on &ldquo;measurement, retailing, consumption and
        the adoption of commercial values and structures was, and still is, at the
        centre of the dilemma for the museum professional in the late 20<sup>th</sup> and
        early 21<sup>st</sup> centuries&rdquo;. As the museum shifts its position, changing
        and competing conceptions of the users of museum services emerge. &ldquo;[A]re
        they consumers, citizens, visitors, users, or some, or all of these, in combination?&rdquo; asks
        McPherson rhetorically.</p>
      <p>The adoption of marketing values and practices can be seen
        as part of the larger shift in museum culture from an object and collections
        orientation to a people-centred view (Hooper-Greenhill, 1992; Weil, 2002).
        But the shift from viewing visitors as an audience to seeing them as
        customers or consumers is even more acutely problematic as it changes
        the nature of the relationship between museum and visitor and brings
        with it a new set of expectations and demands. In fact, it challenges
        established power relations between institution and public. &ldquo;[T]he
        active and discriminating &lsquo;consumer&rsquo; or
        &lsquo;client&rsquo; … h as a contract for the delivery of goods and
        services, and is in a negotiated situation where he or she has an equal
        position of power&rdquo; (Hooper
        Greenhill, 1992). That is where the true source of tension and discomfort
        lies.</p>
      <p>The &lsquo;laws&rsquo; of supply and demand on which the &lsquo;sciences&rsquo; of
        economics and marketing are based provide the mechanism for managing
        exchanges between producers and consumers. Stuck in the audience paradigm,
        museums have not typically been interested in understanding the dynamics
        of demand. The assumption that an audience is simply available means
        that the museum&rsquo;s task
        appears merely to be to make people aware of what it offers. Yet, from
        a marketing perspective, other factors, in particular competition and
        the decision-making behaviours of consumers, are just as important in
        the market equation as the products or services on offer. Competing to
        obtain and retain user interest is an alien concept to the audience paradigm.
        The market conception completely alters the relationship of supply and
        demand for museums, inverting the dependency of consumer on producer
        to its reverse.</p>
      <p>Tobelem comments on the reluctance of museum staff to acknowledge
        that they exist within a (competitive) marketplace. It is often difficult
        for museum staff to comprehend that museums represent just one of many leisure
        choices, focused as they are on their own uniqueness. There is also a certain
        disinclination to go beyond a superficial knowledge of
        &lsquo;customer&rsquo; interests.</p>
      <p>[I]n many museums, what is presented is directed to a theoretical
        visitor and in the final analysis is addressed to an educated public without
        sufficiently investigating the means needed in order to adapt the message
        to the expectations, motivations and respective habits of different visitor
        groups…. (Tobelem, 1997).</p>
      <p>What the marketing perspective offers and insists upon is
        attention focused on those expectations and behaviours rather than on the
        museum&rsquo;s own products and agendas. And this is not just a problem for the
        physical museum. Our Web sites and also our approaches to evaluating them
        epitomise the ambivalent, selective and somewhat confused adoption of the
        marketing perspective within the museum sector. </p>
      <h3>Facing Up To Competition</h3>
      <p>Cyberspace is perhaps the most competitive environment that
        has ever existed. Not only does it have global coverage and low barriers
        to entry (just about anyone can establish a Web site) but, more importantly,
        its users can as well switch among a staggering and rapidly expanding array
        of offerings at an astonishing rate. As well as attracting people to a Web
        site, holding their attention and generating return visits are some of our
        greatest challenges. Yet there is surprisingly little discussion or analysis &ndash; at
        this conference or elsewhere &ndash; regarding competition and the dynamics of
        demand in our examination of museum Web sites. We seem to know very little
        about the market in which our Web offerings compete - a huge gap in our collective
        knowledge. Out of professional respect or just politeness, we also tend to
        ignore the question of competition among museum sites and whether this is
        a good thing or a bad thing for stimulating demand and satisfying users.</p>
      <p>Recently, cultural heritage institutions in Australia received
        a double shock from research which showed a startlingly low use of their
        on-line resources within Australian schools (a key target group) and a strong
        and growing preference amongst younger people for the Web sites of major
        international institutions (Collections Council of Australia, 2006). In the
        on-line space, competition is global and occurs both within and between established
        sectors. No Web site is an island, yet we tend to plan and evaluate as if
        each site is.</p>
      <p>We also seem to show little interest in trends in demand.
        Gratifying as it was to see exponential growth in traffic to museum Web
        sites in their first decade on the back of exponential growth in overall
        Internet use, the rate of growth in traffic to museum Web site has most
        likely slowed to a rate less than overall growth in usage. As a result
        the share of Web &lsquo;eyeballs&rsquo;
        and clicks going to museum Web sites is most probably declining. Should
        this be a matter of concern or not?</p>
      <h3>Use Of Segmentation</h3>
      <p>Market segmentation (the categorisation of customers into
        groups according to their buying behaviour or potential) has been a mainstay
        of marketing practice for more than 50 years. It has been one of the
        most popular techniques for reporting on existing users of museum Web
        sites (Chadwick, Boverie, 1999; Semper et al. 2000; Schaller et al. 2002).
        Users can be segmented according to their responses to survey questions
        or according to the patterns of their behaviour recorded on the site.
        Most typically, survey questions seek information about the age, gender,
        level of education, or Web usage of site users. In a product evaluation
        situation, where the aim is to obtain feedback on a particular resource,
        users may be asked to rank, rate or provide a qualitative response to
        a particular site. </p>
      <p>Demographic user segmentations may be useful in meeting
        and reporting &lsquo;audience development&rsquo; targets as they can demonstrate the
        range and diversity of the user population. At a more sophisticated level
        of analysis, demographics can be correlated with behaviour to provide the
        basis for theories of user motivation and cognition. </p>
      <p>Psychographic segmentation, where motivation and demographics
        are combined, is an established practice in visitor studies of physical museum
        visitors. It is yet to appear in our Web user research. Motivation to use
        a museum Web site has been surveyed occasionally, but only one attempt has
        been made to develop a theory of motivation that might provide a basis for
        psychographic segmentation (Haley Goldman, Schaller, 2004). </p>
      <p>At the moment our segmentation practice is limited to snapshot
        profiles, often based on pop-up surveys with very low response rates that
        make them unreliable at best. All of the effort has gone into segmenting
        existing users rather than segmenting the market, which includes those who
        don&rsquo;t use museum Web sites, a much larger group.</p>
      <p>A recent critique of segmentation practice that appeared
        in <em>Harvard Business Review</em> challenged all marketers to reassess simplistic
        and superficial approaches based on demographic and psychological profiles
        that fail to effectively define strategy. According to the authors, &ldquo;Good
        segmentations identify the groups most worth pursuing&rdquo;, not just apply labels
        to existing customers (Yankelovich, Meer, 2006). They argue instead for segmentations
        based on customer needs and behaviour, as well as a more dynamic approach
        to research.</p>
      <p>Segmentations should be part of an ongoing search for answers
        to important business questions as they arise. Consequently, effective segmentations
        are dynamic- in two senses. First, they concentrate on consumers&rsquo; needs,
        attitudes and behaviour, which can change quickly, rather than on personality
        traits, which usually endure throughout a person&rsquo;s life. Second they are
        shaped by market conditions, such as fluctuating economics, emerging consumer
        niches, and new technologies… (Yankelovich, Meer, 2006)</p>
      <p>Segmentation practice in respect of museum Web sites needs
        to become both richer and more deeply embedded within our ongoing marketing
        and evaluation practices.</p>
      <h3>Lack Of Strategic Marketing Focus</h3>
      <p>Many museum Web sites have not been established with a strategic
        focus or with a sense of their strategic potential. Confusion often exists
        between marketing the Web site and marketing the museum by using the Web
        site. Is the Web site simply a medium for marketing, or a product to be marketed
        in its own right? If it is both, what is the priority and how does one purpose
        support the other?</p>
      <p>The Web site is typically not seen as strategic in and of
        itself. &lsquo;Virtual visitors&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t as highly valued as physical ones.  Too
        often the Web site is seen solely in a support role: as a promotional vehicle
        for exhibitions and events, a &lsquo;showcase&rsquo; for collections and research, or
        a junkyard for corporate ephemera. </p>
      <p>In a recent essay on performance metrics for art museums
        produced for the Getty Leadership Institute, Maxwell Anderson produced a
        comprehensive inventory of measurable indicators for assessing (art) museum
        success (Anderson, 2004). Of the more than one hundred proposed measures,
        only five of those related to the Web. More significantly, those five are
        merely count measures (e.g. number of visitors, number of artworks illustrated
        on the site). Obviously, there is still a way to go before the Web site is
        seriously considered as a tool of strategic significance.</p>
      <p>As Web site managers and developers, it is up to us to make
        and prove the argument for the Web&rsquo;s strategic value. Neil and Philip Kotler,
        in an article on the role of marketing in museums, note that the core of
        strategic planning and marketing &ldquo;is making the right choices of goals and
        strategies and allocating adequate resources&rdquo; (Kotler, Kotler, 2000). This
        is as true for our Web sites as for any other museum activity, perhaps more
        so because of the highly competitive environment in which they exist. Too
        many museum Web sites show the signs of inadequate goal orientation or lack
        a clear sense of the value they are offering and to whom. It is our task
        in researching and evaluating Web site use to convince and demonstrate to
        senior management the strategic value and potential of the Web. To do that
        we need to fully master the techniques and tools of marketing, not merely
        pay lip service to them.</p>
      <h3>Usable Usability</h3>
      <p>Usability evaluation methods (UEMs) have frequently been
        used in evaluating the effectiveness of museum Web sites (Speroni et al.,
        2006; Haley Goldman, Bendoly 2003; Di Blas et al, 2002; Harms, Schweibenz,
        2001; Vergo et al, 2001; Garzotto et al, 1998). UEMs comprise a range of
        techniques such as observation, inspection, and testing, and were originally
        developed from an engineering perspective with a view to improving the functioning
        and user acceptance of software products.  In a Web context, usability has
        been defined by Garzotto et al. as &ldquo;the visitor&rsquo;s ability to use these sites
        and to access their content in the most effective way&rdquo; (Garzotto et al, 1998).</p>
      <p>Usability testing and inspection methods offer the advantage
        of rigorous methodologies, extensive quantification of results and close,
        sometimes microscopic, attention to detail. As a result, they are highly
        labour intensive activities, typically using small research samples. </p>
      <p>A number of concerns have been raised about the usefulness
        and validity of these methods. Teather (1998) suggests that the conception
        of the user employed in UEMs is overly mechanical, neglecting the human in
        the human-computer interaction by reducing the user&rsquo;s role to just &lsquo;another
        system component.&rsquo; Hertzum and Jacobsen (2003) have pointed to the distorting
        &lsquo;evaluator effect&rsquo; in UEMs which leads to inconsistent and unreliable findings
        with heuristic usability testing (i.e. testing conducted by expert evaluators
        according to established criteria). Kate Haley Goldman (2003) notes this
        problem also and observes that &ldquo;[to date] there have been no studies on how
        reliable or valid heuristic evaluation is for museum Web sites.&rdquo; She suggests
        instead the use of multiple methodologies involving significant end user
        testing in combination with heuristic evaluation.</p>
      <p>The heavy focus in UEMs on task performance, both by the
        software and the wetware (users) has also been questioned. As Bolchini and
        Mylopoulos (2003) argue, &ldquo;task-based techniques represent the dominant paradigm
        for the analysis of user requirements.&rdquo; In the case of Web sites, they argue
        for a more goal-oriented approach in defining and testing requirements. They
        suggest that user-centred design should first consider the goals of the user
        before defining and measuring tasks. They also recognise the importance of
        considering the goals of stakeholders alongside those of end-users in any
        analysis. </p>
      <p>Obviously, there is much debate within the field of usability
        design about the effectiveness and appropriateness of its methods. In adopting
        some or all of these approaches in the planning and examination of museum
        Web sites, we need to be mindful of these debates and critiques. </p>
      <p>This is not to denigrate these methods and their findings,
        but merely to make the point that they have their limitations and, at best,
        tell us only a part of the story, often from a particular point of view.
        We should use such findings with caution rather than with certainty. As with
        the marketing paradigm, we must seek to improve our skills in using and critically
        evaluating these techniques.</p>
      <p>By now, we hope it is clear that, notwithstanding their
        potential and achievements as lenses for examining Web users and uses, each
        of these perspectives, or paradigms, brings its own baggage and blinders
        to the task of understanding. Perhaps it is time to step back and consider
        how they might work more effectively together within a more holistic model
        for designing and evaluating museum Web sites.</p>
      <h2>New Conceptual Model For Understanding The Museum Web site Use</h2>
      <p>In proposing a new conceptual model for understanding museum
        Web site use, we are cognisant and respectful of the large, albeit fragmented
        body of work and knowledge that already exists, much of which has been represented
        at Museums and the Web conferences over the past decade. We are following
        the lead of Michael and Kate Haley Goldman (2005) in seeking to consolidate
        and if possible advance the nascent field and professional domain of museum
        Web design.</p>
      <p>What we propose here is a more integrated and holistic approach
        to understanding museum Web site use, taking a broader view of the user experience
        and its context in order to better plan, manage, evaluate and promote our
        on-line endeavours. The model aims to address the gaps, silences and missing
        connections in our current research, as well as to draw on its strengths.</p>
      <p>We are also aware that the various research paradigms that
        underpin our efforts at understanding are not fixed, but also evolve. For
        example, even as museums slowly and perhaps reluctantly embrace a marketing
        paradigm, the field of marketing is itself subject to change and revision.</p>
      <p>In an influential article published in the <em>Journal of
      Marketing</em>, Vargo and Lusch (2004) observe, &ldquo;Over the past 50 years,
      marketing has been transitioning from a product and production focus to
      a consumer focus and, more recently, from a transaction focus to a relationship
      focus.&rdquo;  This is particularly relevant for museum Web sites, which offer
      enormous potential for moving museums from a focus on visitor transactions
      to ongoing engagement. According to Vargo and Lusch, &ldquo;Marketing&rsquo;s role
      as the facilitator of exchange becomes one of identifying and developing
      the core competencies and positioning them as value propositions that offer
      competitive advantage.&rdquo; This is now the strategic challenge and opportunity
      for museum Web sites, both in positioning themselves within the marketplace
      and in positioning the museum as a whole. This new marketing perspective
      offers a lot more to our field of enquiry than do simple demographic or
      psychographic segmentation techniques.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the communications research field has begun to
        apply itself to understanding the experience of Web users in new ways. The
        Uses and Gratifications theory that originated in mass media research provides
        a useful approach to studying on-line behaviour in a way which allows for
        the complex interaction between user and medium, including the &lsquo;social gratifications&rsquo; of
        interactive on-line communities (Stafford, Stafford, 2004). In assimilating
        paradigms from other disciplines, it is essential that we stay abreast of
        their evolution rather than applying methods and constructs which have been
        superseded in their domains of origin.</p>
      <p>The model proposed here incorporates four major levels of
        analysis, each with its own knowledge bases and established conceptual
        and analytical practices. The four levels: <strong>Market</strong>, <strong>User</strong>, <strong>Interaction</strong> and <strong>Product</strong>,
        represent particular knowledge domains, recognisable from the proceeding
        discussion. What we seek to encourage is a strengthening and consolidation
        of each, but more importantly, recognition of their interdependence,
        to break down some of the silos in our current knowledge and to start
        to apprehend the user experience within the truly complex web of people,
        markets and technology that is the world wide Web today.</p>
      <p class=caption><img src="peacock.fig1.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 1: Proposed model for integrated analysis of museum Web site use" width="400" height="314" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Proposed model for integrated analysis of museum
        Web site use</p>
      <p>Too often our attention and research and evaluation efforts
        are focused on just one of these levels of analysis (e.g. site evaluation
        through usability testing, studying user motivation through an on-line survey,
        or analysing Web log statistics to track demand). Yet the links between usability,
        motivation and demand are rarely if ever examined and tested. There is also
        often an imbalance in the focus of our efforts. We closely and repeatedly
        study current users of our sites and seldom, if ever, research non-users
        who comprise the vast majority of the potential market for our sites.</p>
      <p>In some areas, particularly overall demand for on-line museum
        content and competitor analysis, hardly any research has been done. No study
        has tried to map or project demand for digital museum content delivered on-line.
        Yet what good is a highly usable product if the tide of demand is flowing
        in a completely different direction? Similarly, we may know the demographic
        profiles of current users down to two decimal places, but does that tell
        us if they were able to achieve their goals with a particular function on
        our Web site?</p>
      <p>Of course the proposed model does demand a lot of us, both
        in mastering key knowledge areas and in understanding the linkages between
        the levels of analysis. However, if we take this more holistic view, it will
        be easier to see how the pieces fit and, over time, to build a sustainable
        body of knowledge to improve our practice, satisfy our users and convince
        senior management of the value of our efforts. </p>
      <p>Similarly, it offers a framework for discussion about methodological
        issues and, hopefully, a basis for collaborative effort in building a consolidated
        and comprehensive view from which we can all benefit. Research and evaluation
        are expensive undertakings:  the more we can learn from each other and the
        less we duplicate our efforts, the richer our understandings will become,
        and more quickly.</p>
      <p>Use of a model such as this will promote a move from a snapshot
        approach to research and evaluation to a systems model of Web user research.
        The system may be large and complex, but the holistic view should be much
        more informative than the sum of the parts. In using this model there will
        be less focus on head counting and more on the potential for relationship
        building, a strategic focus on developing market share and positioning -
        not just more Web sites and a greater emphasis on evaluating products not
        just functionally, but in terms of their adequacy for user needs.</p>
      <p>The model can be seen as useful both at the level of the
        profession (the museum Web development field) and at the level of the individual
        organisation. It offers a road map for piecing together knowledge of your
        site&rsquo;s users and tracking it over time. In the final section of this paper
        we look at how the thinking behind the model has been applied in a current
        Web site redevelopment project.</p>
      <h2>Theory into Practice</h2>
      <p>Museum Victoria is a major, multi-campus science, natural
        and social history institution located in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.
        Established in 1852, it holds Australia&rsquo;s most extensive museum collections,
        some 16 million items. The major campus, Melbourne Museum, opened in 2000
        and is the largest museum site in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
      <p>Museum Victoria (MV) established a Web presence (<a href="../http://www.museumvictoria.com.au/" target="_blank">http://www.museumvictoria.com.au</a>)
        in 1995. Now MV maintains seven core Web sites, as well as hosting another
        eight sites on behalf of, or in partnership with, other organisations. Over
        the years, four redesigns have been undertaken. In 2006, MV developed a new
        three-year Web strategy which involves a major redevelopment and consolidation
        of the core sites, including the implementation of integrated content management
        software and a new corporate visual identity system.</p>
      <p>The vision developed as part of the Web strategy is for
        MV&rsquo;s Web sites: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">to be recognised throughout Australia and the world
        for innovative resources that engage, inform and educate a broad range
        of users. The &lsquo;core&rsquo; Web site will allow easy access to venue specific information
      and details relating to our collection areas whilst the &lsquo;content&rsquo; sites
      will contribute to our communities&rsquo; access and understanding of all Museum
      Victoria&rsquo;s disciplines while continuing to lead by example in terms
      of accessibility, usability and engagement.</p>
      <p>The new site will go live in the middle of 2007. Much of
        2006 was spent in planning for the redevelopment and integration of the core
        sites. While the scope of reworking the entire suite of content sites (some
        53 micro- or satellite-sites encompassing more than 60,000 unique Web pages)
        is too great for complete redevelopment, work will be undertaken to incorporate
        all content into a meaningful and flexible framework allowing easy discovery
        and sensible contextual navigation. </p>
      <p>What follows here is a description of the approach taken
        in planning for the needs of users of the newly developed site. It is an
        example in practice of the ideas and methods discussed above for identifying
        and designing Web sites in order to meet user needs. </p>
      <h3>Intensive User Research</h3>
      <p>MV has made substantial investment in visitor research over
        a number of years and has a well developed understanding of the visitors
        to its three main sites: Melbourne Museum, Scienceworks, and the Immigration
        Museum. Detailed visitor surveying and project focus group sessions are undertaken
        regularly, and a motivational segmentation matrix has been developed to describe
        our four major types of visitors.</p>
      <p>While this research has proven useful in marketing, tracking
        and evaluation of museum visits, we knew that we need different data and
        a different approach to segmentation for our Web site users. Even though
        we (and other researchers) know there is often a significant overlap between
        museum visitors and Web site users (Thomas, Carey, 2005), we were concerned
        first and foremost with these people&rsquo;s <em>Web use</em>, not just their propensity
        to visit the museum or not. </p>
      <p>There are four main methods for discovering information
        about Web users: two which rely on automated data collection, and two which
        require direct user input. </p>
      <p><em>Web log files</em> provide a record of site activity that
        can be analysed systematically and tracked over time. There are a number
        of limitations and caveats on the use of log data. However, used judiciously,
        it is an invaluable and underutilised data source (Peacock, 2002). </p>
      <p><em>Web page tagging</em> is a newer method for automatically
        tracking user behaviour. It relies on scripts embedded within a Web page.
        It overcomes some of the problems of Web log data, but has its own limitations
        too. Page tagging is offered as a service by a range of ISPs and market researchers. </p>
      <p><em>On-line surveys using a pop-up form</em> provide
        a third method of data collection. These have been the primary data sources
        used in a number of studies reported at this conference (e.g. Streten 2000).
        However they typically suffer from a low response rate, making them at best
        indicative and, at worst, completely misleading.</p>
      <p><em>Direct interaction with users,</em> either through Face
        to face or telephone interviews, individually / singly, or through observation
        in a usability-testing type scenario, is a final method. Once again this
        method has its own inherent limitations: what is reported may not be what
        happens in reality, including the distorting &lsquo;evaluator effect&rsquo;.</p>
      <p>We used all four data sources in building up our picture
        of the users of our sites, trying to &lsquo;triangulate&rsquo; the view and balance out
        the limitations and biases of each data collection method.</p>
      <h3>Market Research</h3>
      <p>This area is often neglected in planning museum Web sites,
        as discussed above. What we needed was knowledge not just about our own site,
        but about the market overall. What are the peers and competitors for our
        site? What are the overall market trends in the sector we are in &ndash; broadly
        defined as education by Web monitoring services such as &lsquo;Hitwise&rsquo; (<a href="../http://www.hitwise.com/" target="_blank">http://www.hitwise.com</a>)?
        What is happening overall in terms of on-line traffic? Are there opportunities
        or risks for which we can plan? We were able to use data from a number of
        sources to build our understanding of the market in which our Web site competed.</p>
      <p>Currently, according to official statistics, 4.7 million
        Australian households, or 60% of all households, have Internet access at
        home (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006). Almost
        half of those households are now using broadband connections, typically meaning
        they use the Internet more often and for longer periods. Three-quarters of
        Australians aged 16 and over have used the Internet at some time. Of those,
        Internet ratings agency Nielsen//Netratings reports that 56% regularly access
        educational/study type Web sites in any one year (Nielsen/Netratings, 2005).
        This suggests a large potential group of users for the MV Web site. </p>
      <p>The number of actual users of MV&rsquo;s sites is more difficult
        to estimate, as it not possible to accurately ascertain the number of individuals
        using a site from the number of sessions. Nonetheless, a recent (July 2006)
        Newspoll omnibus telephone survey of 300 people in MV&rsquo;s home state of Victoria
        provides some insight. Of those surveyed, 17% indicated that they had been
        to a MV Web site. The other 83% had not visited an MV Web site or did not
        know if they had.</p>
      <p>In summary, the overall number of people who have used the
        Internet in Australia probably now exceeds 10 million. In any one year, possibly
        half of those use the Web for educational or study related purposes. Allowing
        for some over-reporting in the telephone survey, perhaps 10% of Victorians
        (some 500,000 people) have ever used an MV site. With the continuing growth
        of Internet use, there is considerable potential to increase usage amongst
        the 5 million + Victorians and other Australians who regularly use the Internet
        for education/study purposes.</p>
      <p>Tracking trends, conventions and offerings of peer organisations
        in our own sector provided us with valuable insight into how a user might
        approach a museum Web site generally, and how we might present our information
        in a way consistent with that understanding and expectation. We chose 12
        cultural organisations &ndash; local, national and international &ndash; and produced
        a report based on comparison in six areas of site structure, design, features
        and content. Analysis of these results has shown clear conventions in some
        areas (particularly in naming and labeling), but a wide diversity of approach
        in others (e.g. site functionality and services).</p>
      <h3>Use-based Segmentation</h3>
      <p>Market segmentation is used to focus attention on the most
      likely users of the museum&rsquo;s on-line content and services. Segmentation
      can be applied using demographic, psychographic or motivational analysis,
      as discussed above. For Web users, segmentation should first and foremost
      relate to the needs and behaviours of people in a Web environment. These
      needs and behaviours are more effective predictors of future Web use than
      other segmentation criteria. Demographic and psychographic characteristics
      are secondary to the needs and motivations of people as
      Web site users.
      The most direct and effective way to identify and satisfy these needs is
      to segment the market according to those needs rather than according to
      secondary characteristics, which at best may inform, rather than predict
      Web site usage.</p>
      <p>Based on quantitative and qualitative research undertaken
      directly by MV and on its behalf by Nielsen/NetRatings, a broad segmentation
      of MV Web site users was developed. The four major segments are defined
      as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visitors</strong>:
          those people using the Web site to plan or follow up a visit to a museum
        venue</li>
    <li><strong>Searchers</strong>:
      those people using the Web site to locate specific subject-based information</li>
    <li><strong>Browsers</strong>:
      those people who access the Web site as part of browsing activities on the
      Web</li>
    <li><strong>Transactors</strong>:
      those people who use the Web site to interact or transact with MV.</li>
	    </ul>
      <p class="caption"><img src="peacock.fig2.jpg" alt="Fig 2:&nbsp;Proportion of sessions in each user segment across MV Web sites (Source: Calculated from the Nielsen/NetRatings survey and page tracking data)" width="356" height="257" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2:  Proportion of sessions in each user segment across
        MV Web sites (Source: Calculated from the Nielsen/NetRatings survey and page
        tracking data)</p>
      <h3>Targeting and Prioritising Strategies</h3>
      <p>Traffic to MV&rsquo;s Web sites has increased fivefold since 2000,
      from 570,000 user sessions annually to more than 3 million in 2005. In
      the 2005-06 year there were more than 3.5 million user sessions on MV&rsquo;s
      Web sites. This was an increase of 19% over 2004-05.</p>
      <p>While an upward trend in site visitation is desirable and
      satisfies basic key performance indicator reporting, our intention is to
      describe in more detail the benefits to our users and to ourselves. Thus,
      our objectives for the new Web site are threefold:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>extend
          the reach of the site</em> by increasing the number and range of people
        in each segment; </li>
    <li><em>enhance
      the impact of the site</em> by increasing the usefulness and value of the
      site to users, and </li>
    <li><em>increase
      the value of the site to the museum</em> in terms of awareness, loyalty,
      participation and revenue. </li>
	    </ol>
      <p>A range of strategies will be undertaken to attract, engage
        and satisfy users, and build traffic, usage and returns to the museum. The
        major types of strategy that will be employed are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>visibility
        strategies</em> &ndash; to raise the site profile and user awareness of the site,</li>
    <li><em>acquisition
      strategies</em> &ndash; to increase traffic to the site by improving the quality,
      organisation, functionality and offerings of the site, and</li>
    <li><em>conversion
      strategies</em> &ndash; to improve the depth of use and &lsquo;stickiness&rsquo;
      of the site, increasing returns to the museum in terms of engagement, relationship
      management and income.</li>
	    </ul>
      <p>Potential museum visitors and transactors offer greater long-term
      value to the museum in terms of engagement, advocacy and support, as well
      as income generation. While searchers and browsers are also valuable, the
      priority with those users is finding ways to convert them to a deeper level
      of engagement, either as visitors or transactors. These are the groups &lsquo;most
      worth pursuing&rsquo; with additional effort and resources, to borrow Yankelovich
      and Meer&rsquo;s (2006) phrase. It is not in the museums interest to merely service
      the searchers and browsers, who offer little in terms of recognition, loyalty
      or revenue.</p>
      <h3>Development Of Needs-Based User Personas</h3>
      <p>Personas are a tool to help understand user needs and
        behaviours. They represent characterisations of typical users, and were devised
        to inform usability testing in software development projects. Eight personas
        have been developed to assist in planning the MV&rsquo;s Web site redevelopment
        project. Each persona represents a key user segment. The personas are based
        on current knowledge of user behaviour and will be developed and refined
        as part of the usability testing plan for the project. In recruiting user
        testers, the personas act as a broad set of selection criteria.</p>
      <p>The personas are &lsquo;real&rsquo; in the sense that they are composite
        representations of the drivers, goals and circumstances affecting use of
        the museum&rsquo;s Web sites. In combination with personas, task scenarios enable
        the Web site planning and development team to test the site design and performance
        against typical user activities. </p>
      <h3>User Research And Testing</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the user testing process is to assess the
        Web site redevelopment continually throughout its various stages to inform
        the process. The research will assess the usability and navigability of the
        Web site, as well as comprehensibility of Web site labels and functions.</p>
      <p>A pool of eight participants has been recruited to represent
        a range of Web site user types based on our persona descriptions. Participants
        take part in five sessions lasting one hour, and are paid for their time. </p>
      <p>To date, two of the five sessions have been run &ndash; the
        first focusing on global navigation naming and grouping, the second looking
        at more detailed information architecture.</p>
      <p><strong>Navigation</strong></p>
      <p>Two different versions of the activity were conducted. The
        first group of participants was given a set of  five index cards with fixed
        global navigation labels. They were asked to sort a set of sub-navigation
        labels into these five categories. The second group of participants was given
        a broader pool of global navigation labels to choose from (the previous labels
        plus a few extras). First they chose a set of global navigation labels (limited
        to four-six labels); afterward, they continued the card sort. In both versions
        of the card sort, participants were encouraged to add, replicate, or exclude
        cards as needed. Notes were taken throughout, and a photograph was taken
        at the end. </p>
      <p>General observations regarding what kind of information
        might be found within top-level groupings have provided valuable insight
        into users&rsquo; expectations. Of particular interest were comments relating to
        ambiguous or misleading labeling, some of which challenged long-held conventions
        which in turn led to a few &ldquo;ah-ha!&rdquo; moments.</p>
      <p><strong>Information Architecture Wireframes</strong></p>
      <p>Participants were shown a mock-up of the proposed information
        architecture of the redeveloped Web site. The mock-up was a basic skeleton
        of the site structure with clickable links but no images or content. It included
        navigation across the MV core site, including venue sub-sites, with global
        navigation and a few layers of navigation below that. </p>
      <p>Findings included the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generally
          the navigation was clear and simple. Users did not mind if their first navigation
          choice was incorrect (i.e. the target did not result in delivery of expected
          content), as long as they realised it quickly and could move on to try another
        option.</li>
    <li>Users
      didn&rsquo;t spontaneously mention the museum venue navigation buttons, but when
      asked, they expressed what they were and expected that content would vary
      by museum.</li>
    <li>MV as a parent organisation which operates several museum venues is not an easy
      concept for people to take in; there is some confusion between MV and Melbourne
      Museum.</li>
    <li>Some
      terminology is confusing, and clarification is required.</li>
	    </ul>
      <p>While it is not possible to accommodate each participant&rsquo;s
        individual preference into future iterations of structure and design, the
        user testing allows us to confirm our own assumptions (or not!) as well as
        cater generally to expectations of our defined user-base. </p>
      <p>The next scheduled user testing sessions will ask participants
        to explore and comment on more worked-up design models. In future, as the
        site nears its final form, participants will perform scenarios to test more
        complex interactions with our content and services. </p>
      <h3>Performance Monitoring</h3>
      <p>Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of Web site usage is an
        essential part of ensuring that the site achieves its objectives. Quantitative
        data will be collected through automated tracking tools within the museum&rsquo;s
        server logs and Web page tagging. This data will be supplemented with periodic
        qualitative surveys of users, conducted both  through questionnaires on-line
        and through surveys of visitors to MV venues. We will set and track annual
        targets and provide the basis for ongoing analysis and review of site design,
        content and functionality.</p>
      <p>In order to manage Web site performance and effectiveness
        goals, a consistent, standard set of metrics has been developed to track
        usage of the Web site over time and to identify issues and opportunities
        for improvement. The metrics cover the following areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>traffic &ndash; </em>overall
        volumes of usage, annual, monthly, weekly patterns</li>
    <li><em>sessions &ndash; </em>features
      of individual user sessions</li>
    <li><em>search &ndash; </em>terms
      and methods used to reach the site and locate information within the site</li>
    <li><em>referrer &ndash; </em>sources
      of referrals to the site, including search engines and links</li>
    <li><em>transaction &ndash; </em>quantity
      and variety of transactions conducted on the site</li>
    <li><em>participation &ndash; </em>level
      and range of participation on on-line interactive activities</li>
    <li><em>satisfaction &ndash; </em>direct
      and indirect measures of audience satisfaction</li>
	    </ul>
      <p>In addition, MV will continue to track the peer and competitor
        environments to identify trends and potential opportunities.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this paper has been to examine the state
        of our knowledge about museum Web site users and propose a new conceptualisation
        to consolidate and advance that knowledge in a rapidly evolving environment.
        In conclusion, we suggest the following six principles to guide and support
        future Web site development and evaluation practice.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognise
        that museum Web sites exist within a marketplace</li>
    <li>Be
      clear about site goals, from market, organisational and user perspectives</li>
    <li>Design
      in accordance with those goals</li>
    <li>Design
      an information space, not a replica of the physical museum</li>
    <li>Test
      with target users, over and over, at every stage of design and build</li>
    <li>Evaluate
      in terms of your (market) goals, not just according to the demographics of
      users or the product features of the site.</li>
	    </ul>
      <p>In adopting these principles and applying the proposed model
        at the organisational level and to the profession as a whole, our hope is
        that we will be able to reconceptualise not just our Web sites, but also
        our relationships with the people who use them and the marketplace in which
        they exist. Over time, this will create successful ongoing interactions between
        users and museums, to the advantage of both.</p>
