				<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
				<p class="abstract">As 2006 began, there were less than thirty known museum
				  blogs; since then, that number has more than doubled. Today there are well
				  over 100 blogs exploring museum issues, from a range of institutions and
				  individuals across the globe. All of these blogs have embraced the concept
				  of &lsquo;radical trust,&rsquo; taking the big step to trust (radically)
				  the community on-line. This paper reports the findings of the first major
				  survey of museum blog operators and their readers. Developed by Powerhouse
				  Museum and Ideum, this comprehensive survey of bloggers paints a picture
				  of where the field is today, and where it is headed in the future.</p>
				<p class="abstract">How popular are they? How is popularity measured? Do
				  these blogs operate from the inside or the outside of museums? Who is their
				  audience? What of RSS, aggregators, and link exchanges? Are there emerging
				  commonalities in practice and usage that can be brought together to strengthen
				  and expand the collective worth and impact of museum blogging? This paper
				  explores these questions and more. Several successful operational models
				  have emerged and are outlined here, along with emerging trends for the
				  field. It is our hope that these survey results will also provide a starting
				  point for those museums looking to launch their own blogs.</p>

  <h2 class="PaperTitle">Introduction</h2>
  <p >In 2006 the number of blogs created by and for museums
    grew exponentially. MuseumBlogs.org, the primary aggregator and portal for
    the sector, began the year with around 30 blogs and concluded 2006 with 95
    registered feeds. By the end of January 2007, this number had jumped to 111
    blogs , representing a fairly dramatic jump to start off the new year.</p>
  <p >Blogs pre-date the current Web 2.0 phenomenon and have
    been around since the very early days of the Web, first appearing as on-line
    diaries. By the late &rsquo;90s, the term <strong>blog</strong> was in use, and its popularity
    began to rise (Wikipedia, 2007). Museum blogs didn&rsquo;t arrive on the scene
    until 2002, with <em>infoTECMuseo</em> launching in June, <em>Museum People</em> in
    August, and <em>Modern Art Notes</em> in September of that year (Museum Blogs,
    2007). <strong> </strong></p>
  <p >According to Technorati, a blog-only search engine, there
    were 55 million blogs as of January 2007 (Technorati, 2007). This number
    has nearly doubled in the last year. The number of museum blogs grew at roughly
    twice that rate in 2006. (Not hard to do, considering how underrepresented
    the field was in the larger blogosphere.) The first informal survey of museum
    blogs in March of 2006 (Spadaccini, 2006) revealed around 30 museum blogs
    at a time when there were around 30 million blogs. It was noted then that
    museum blogs were &lsquo;literally one in a million.&rsquo; Today museum blogs are effectively
    1 in 500,000, still a rarity in the larger blogosphere.</p>
  <p >Blogging is the easiest of the group of social software
    (blogs, wikis, on-line forums, social networking services, etc) to set up.
    It is cheap and technically simple, and it could be argued that it has the
    lowest level of &lsquo;threat&rsquo; to existing workflows and work practices. In many
    ways a blog is simply a diary-style Web site with chronologically ordered
    entries that, more often than not, allows readers to comment on each entry.
    Even this ability for readers to comment can be switched off. This is in
    particular contrast to wikis and community engines which, by their very nature,
    allow much more unbounded community interaction. </p>
  <p >Outside the museum world, blogging has been adopted by
    many technology companies both to improve internal communication and, on
    occasion, to communicate directly with their customers in supposedly less
    formal ways. &ldquo;Enterprise blogging&rdquo; is seen as a means to improve internal
    collaboration and productivity through better &ldquo;knowledge management,&rdquo; as
    well as to give the impression of &lsquo;&rdquo;transparency&rdquo; with customers (McAfee,
    2006; Mayfield, 2006). The success of blogging in the commercial world has
    not led to museums&rsquo; embracing this technology in their own.</p>
  <p >Indeed, many museums have been reluctant to experiment
    with blogging. Most conversations about museums on blogs take place in the
    larger blogosphere as visitors, teenagers, and tourists discuss their visitor
    experiences. The museums themselves remain on the sidelines (von Appen, 2006).
    Those institutions and individuals who represent museum blogs are still playing
    the role of pioneers.</p>
  <p >It is into this environment that museum blogs have emerged.
    Some were established by in-house IT teams; others have sprung up to track
    the development of an exhibition or special project; and some serve to document
    research projects. Excitingly, as these blogs have gone public, many have
    experienced new unexpected interactions with public audiences and, as their
    content has been captured by search engines, they have also attracted new
    audiences who had been previously unaware of the host organization (Russo,
    Watkins, Kelly, and Chan 2006).</p>
  <p >Also, as many viral marketing companies have found, blogs
    also provide a cost-effective way of &lsquo;gaming&rsquo; search engines, quickly raising
    one&rsquo;s Google PageRank (Google, 2007) and thus one&rsquo;s discoverability. Additionally,
    more blog-generated pages, categories, and keywords provide more content
    to be indexed, bringing in even more visitors from search engines over time.
    Having a presence in the blogosphere and the larger Web 2.0 world can help
    ensure visibility in the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; Web 1.0 world.</p>
  <h2>Survey Methodology</h2>
  <h3>About the Survey</h3>
  <p >This survey was undertaken in two stages. The first was
    a single-day snapshot analysis of each of the 95 blogs found listed in the
    Museum Blog directory. The second stage was a public survey accessible through
    the site. Fifty-three bloggers representing 51 museum blogs responded to
    the formal survey.</p>
  <h3>Stage One - Analyzing MuseumBlogs.org</h3>
  <p >On December 21, 2006, 95 blogs on MuseumBlogs.org were
    manually visited and the following details were collected:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The
      number of posts in the previous 30 days</li>
    <li> The
      number of user comments in the previous 30 days</li>
    <li> The
      date of the last post</li>
    <li> The
      average post length in words</li>
    <li> Blogging
      software used (if evident)</li>
    <li> The
      number of external links in the sidebar of the blog</li>
    <li> The
      presence (if any) and type of advertising</li>
	  </ul>
  <p >Each site was also checked for back links from Google,
    and their Technorati ranking was recorded. These figures were collected to
    allow for an examination of their usage and frequency of update, as well
    as their relative &ldquo;popularity&rdquo; and &ldquo;authority&rdquo; as determined by linkbacks. </p>
  <h3>Stage Two &ndash; The On-line Survey</h3>
  <p >The URL of the survey was e-mailed to the administrator
    addresses of each blog listed on MuseumBlogs.org, and announcements were
    posted on the <em>Ideum blog</em> and <em>Fresh + New</em> at the Powerhouse
    Museum (December 19, 2006). A reminder e-mail was sent a few days prior to
    the closure of the survey to these same addresses, as well as to the <em>MCN-L</em> (Museum
    Computer Network) discussion list (January 4, 2007).</p>
  <h2>Survey Results</h2>

  <p class="caption">Table 1.2 Top 15 blogs ranked by Google links. Data retrieved
    12/21/06.</p>
  <h2>What Does This All Mean?</h2>
  <p >There are some interesting common features that most of
    the top-ranked museum blogs share. The first is that these sites tend to
    post more frequently (avg 37.6 per month) than the average museum blogs (10.17
    per month). More posts mean more possibilities for links back to the blog
    or trackbacks (links that allow bloggers to see citations from other blogs).
    In addition, posting more often means more aggregated content through blog
    aggregators and other services.</p>
  <p >Related to frequency of posting, the operational models
    that most of these top sites employ seems to be a factor. <em>Botany Photo
      of the Day</em> and <em>The Andy Warhol</em> blog (until its closure) are somewhat
    automated, providing new content regularly while staying focused in a particular
    topic area. <em>Eye Level</em>,<em> Science Buzz</em>,<em> Musematic</em>,<em> Hanging
      Together</em>,<em> Walker Blogs</em>,<em> National Museums Liverpool</em>, and
    Y<em>esterday SG</em> have teams of bloggers, allowing for more frequent postings,
    but also for varied perspectives. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the lone blogger
    cannot be successful; the most prolific blog was <em>Zeke&rsquo;s Galler</em>y which
    is also the 4th most popular of all museum blogs (according to Technorati).</p>
  <p >The top four in the Technorati Ranking - <em>Modern Art
      Notes</em>,<em> Eye Level</em>,<em> Botany Photo of the Day</em>, and <em>Zeke&rsquo;s
      Gallery</em> - appeal to the general public. Museum blogs as a whole are
      split between those that are geared for a public audience and those that
      focus on professional development. As we&rsquo;ll see in the results from the
      on-line survey, the split was nearly 50/50. Of the top blogs, <em>Hanging
      Together</em> and <em>Musematic</em> are the only two that focus squarely
      on professional development.</p>
  <p >Another measure of success is a blog&rsquo;s engagement with
    its target audience. This is best measured by the volume, quality, and relevance
    of comments in response to posts. While a few blogs surveyed do not allow
    commenting and measuring, quality and relevance is beyond the scope of this
    study.</p>

  <p class="caption">Table 1.3 Top 15 blogs ranked by the number of user comments
    in previous 30 days. Data retrieved 12/21/06. </p>
  <p >Examining this list of blogs, a different picture emerges.
    Here the blogs that rank highly are those that invite user participation
    as a factor of their content and design. Many of these blogs operate as community
    hubs (<em>Museum People</em>, a group LiveJournal conversation) and professional-to-professional
    blogs such as <em>Fresh &amp; New</em>, <em>Inherent Vice</em>, <em>Museum 2.0</em>,<em> Hanging
      Together,</em> <em>Oz</em>, <em>Musematic</em>, and <em>Ideum Blog</em>. Of those
    aimed directly at the general public, <em>Botany Photo of the Day</em>, <em>Science
      Buzz</em>, and <em>Observations</em> all can be demonstrated to be engaging
    successfully with their target audience by measuring participation in, and
    reaction to, blog postings.</p>
  <h3>Stage Two &ndash; The On-line Survey</h3>
  <p >The on-line survey collected information from 51 blogs
    submitted by 53 individuals (two blogs had two authors participate), more
    than half of the known museum blogs at the time the survey was conducted.
    Accordingly, the group represents a wide range of institutions, individuals,
    and blogs from across the globe, representing many &lsquo;first world&rsquo; countries
    of North America, Europe, and Oceania. </p>
  <p >Most of the blogs that participated use English as their
    primary language although five of the blogs are in other languages. This
    is fairly representative of the number of foreign language blogs that currently
    appear on the Museum Blogs site. As of late January 2007, 13 of the 111 blogs
    in the directory were in a language other than English.</p>
  <p >More than half of the participating blogs are directly
    affiliated with a museum, a university, or an institution of some sort. From
    those who responded to the question of what &lsquo;Department&rsquo; they were affiliated
    with, a wide range of responses was collected. Museum blogs can be found
    in exhibit and exhibitions departments, collections, education, marketing,
    or IT or specialized Web departments. The diversity represented here is in
    keeping with McAfee&rsquo;s (2006) assertion that social software will initially
    emerge from various places within large organizations, rather than from the &lsquo;top
    down.&rsquo; </p>
  <p >Most of the participants (46 of 53) agreed to share their
    responses. We will quote some of those responses directly as we summarize
    the results of the on-line survey.</p>
  <p ><strong>Purpose and Target Audience</strong></p>
  <p >We asked bloggers to describe their target audience and
    the purpose of their blog. As indicated in the first the survey, there is
    a split between those that are geared for the general public and those focusing
    on museum professionals. In addition, there are blogs that target both of
    these audiences as the numbers indicate (General Public and Museum Professionals
    have shares of more than half of the responses). </p>

  <p class="caption">Table 2.1 Target audiences of museum blogs </p>
  <p >When we asked participants to describe the purpose of
    the blog, we received a wide range of responses. There were few common threads
    (although a number blogs used the word &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; in describing their
    purpose). Here are a few comments from those blogs that are geared primary
    for professional development.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The purpose of Musematic was to provide a place for museum
    information professionals to talk about museum technology. Several of us
    also have a foot in the library community and we observed the growth of blogging
    as a professional communication tool and felt that the museum community needed
    a similar venue. Musematic was conceived as an experimental space and we
    continue to refine our expectations and goals.  (Richard Urban, Musematic,
    USA)</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">This blog wants to reflect the complexity of the education
    in the museums, the problems which daily we faced and to the rich horizon
    that appears before us. Between the strictly academic and nonformal thing,
    applying old methodologies or experimenting with present, looking for new
    ways to spread the knowledge of our institutions, those that we dedicated
    ourselves to these questions we looked for our voice before the interferences
    of other professionals (Rufino Ferreras, Museo Abierto, Spain).</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">e-artcasting is a nonprofit research project, an information
    source&rsquo; [sic] and a professional network to share experiences, exchange information
    and develop resources about Sociable Technologies in Art Museums from all
    over the world. It is our belief that these new ways of communication are
    valuable tools for Art Museums interacting with their audiences. From this
    point of view, e-artcasting explores and documents their use, impact, and
    possibilities. (lamusediffuse [name given)], e-artcasting, [country not given]).</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Share my experience in museum projects as multimedia content
    producer: films, interactives, videogames, kiosks, web sites, and installations.
    Explain my company goals and motivations. Publish our references  (St&eacute;phane
    Bezombes, Reciproque, France).</p>
  <p >Among those that target the general public or museum visitors
    there was also sense that blogging is new ground.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">It is still early days for us and this blog and the exhibition
    itself probably have a rather narrowly banded target audience of interested
    people. We are still learning by using the blog, but feedback and evaluation
    to date seems positive. I've found the process of blogging the curation of
    an exhibition to be useful in itself. It does help one keep a focus on the
    exhibition itself and just thinking about regularly generating content for
    the blog has a number of useful benefits for the exhibition team (Mal Booth,
    Lawrence of Arabia and the Light Horse, Australia).</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Support has grown. [The blog] was not a marketing initiative
    but came from discussion between program and web staff. In fact, marketing
    had issues dealing with unorthodox approach to the program (which basically
    is a hoax with parents as collaborators) [but] now marketing can see the
    value and are increasingly using it in their own PR (Helen Whitty, Dragon
    &amp; The Pearl, Australia)</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">This blog is a part of Questacon's contribution to International
    Polar Year. The blog is really an experiment,
    to see whether we can facilitate a working scientist in communicating about
    his work (and somewhat unusual life), as well to see what sort of audience
    we can create for that. The scientist writing the blog is from the Australian
    National University, and will spend four or so months in Antarctica (he's
    just arrived by ship as of writing this)  (Geoff Crane, Polar Passport, Australia/Antartica).</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The blog is really part of a bigger Web publishing effort
    that began in April of 2006. Stories are generated for a weekly e-newsletter,
    our Web site, a bi-monthly printed publication that now has circulation of
    250,000, as well as general news releases. When I started in April, there
    was little or no participation from anyone. Now, we're getting story submissions
    from all parts of the institution. We have a long way to go, but the stories
    are flowing and being told. The staff seems thrilled. We've come a long way
    in less than a year (Stan Orchard, Pacific Science Center, USA).</p>
  <h3>Operational Details</h3>
  <p >The on-line survey looked at who publishes to the blog,
    how frequently, and whether these posts are published directly or are reviewed
    in some way. Given the diverse nature of museum blogs, the &lsquo;type&rsquo; of individual
    varied accordingly. No particular type of individual had more than 14 total
    responses (see Table 2.2).</p>

  </table>
  <p class="caption">Table 2.2: Museum bloggers describe themselves.</p>
  <p >Many of the survey participants made more than one choice
    and the &lsquo;Other&rsquo; category contained a wide-variety of individual responses
    such as<em>: media developer, librarian, historian, museum youth staff, IT
      specialist, Collections Assistant, Podcast Producer</em>. The diversity of
    museum blogs represented by those who operate them is apparent here.</p>
  <p >The question of whether staff members publish directly
    or whether content goes through a team for review explores a key operational
    question. Blogs have a reputation for informality, spontaneity, and championing
    the individual. In a large institution this tendency of social media such
    as blogs often runs counter to both institutional policy and culture. Surprisingly
    then, of the respondents, nearly four-fifths publish directly. Seven respondents
    reported that content is reviewed and of these, one reviewed content of posts
    by some individuals but not others. Frequency of posting is in keeping with
    the findings of our single-day analysis, where the average number of posts
    was 10.17. In the on-line survey, 62.3 percent of respondents post 5 or fewer
    times per month; 9.4 percent between 6 and 10 times per month; and 28.3 percent
    over 10 times per month. </p>
  <p >Resources and sustainability are ongoing concerns for
    bloggers, with only 6 of 53 receiving any form of exhibit or project funding,
    and only 2 receiving support from their marketing departments. The lack of
    resources may explain why the time spent managing and maintaining the blogs
    is relatively low, with more than half reporting 5 hours or less per-month. </p>

  <h3>Visitation and Evaluation</h3>
  <p >The vast majority of museum bloggers measure visitation:
    over four-fifths (81.13 percent) responded positively when asked. Not surprisingly,
    a majority of survey respondents (33 of 53) cited the number of visitors
    as a measure of success of their blogs. However, about half the museum bloggers
    cited the &ldquo;Quality and relevance of comments&rdquo; (27 of 53) and &ldquo;Number of links&rdquo; (25
    of 53) as benchmarks to measure success. A lesser number of museum bloggers
    listed the &ldquo;Geographic spread of blog visitors&rdquo; (15 of 53) and the &ldquo;Number
    of media mentions&rdquo; (10 of 53).</p>
  <h3>Technology</h3>
  <p >The platforms that museum bloggers employ are fairly evenly
    split between installed software and blog hosting services. Those who have
    installed software prefer WordPress (22 of 53), with Moveable Type (3 of
    53) and Drupal (2 of 53) marginally represented. For hosted services a similar
    pattern emerges, with Blogger (17 of 53) dominating. Only TypePad (2 of 53)
    had more than one user of the remaining services.</p>
  <p >The majority of museum blogs support some type of syndication:
    only about one-fifth do not (11 of 53). As far as syndication format is concerned,
    RSS was the most popular (37 of 53), with Atom not far behind (21 of 53).</p>
  <p >Most museum bloggers use supplementary blogging software
    tools and services. A majority (29 of 53) reported using Technorati. Feedburner
    (16 of 53) and Google Blog Search (19 of 53) were also fairly well represented,
    although about one-fifth of the respondents (9 of 53) reported using no outside
    blogging software tools or services.</p>
  <h3>Successes and Challenges</h3>
  <p >We asked survey respondents to share &lsquo;success stories&rsquo; and
    while many commented that they were still too new to blogging to have much
    to share, there were a few interesting stories.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">&ldquo;In less than two years the blogs on our web site have
    gone from zero visits to the 3rd highest traffic part of our site after our
    on-line Collections and the Walker home page. Each month shows about a 30
    percent gain.&rdquo;   (Brent Gustaf, New Media Initiatives, USA)</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">&ldquo;My audience is limited as I write in Swedish to a narrow
    group of people. But I think that I have an audience. Now a year since I
    started the blog I get serious comments and lots of encouraging words The
    blog has appeared in museum employees workers' union magazine in an article
    about exhibition reviews&rdquo; (Karolina Uggla, Kuriosakabinettet, Cabinet of
    Curiosities, Sweden).<br />
    &ldquo;Several posts about new web 2.0 services have been responded to by the CEOs
    of the relevant companies within 24 hours!&rdquo; (Seb Chan, Fresh + New, Australia).</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">&ldquo;The word &lsquo;love&rsquo; appears in over a hundred search result
    hits for [our] subdomain [in Google] (Daniel Mosquin, Botany Photo of the
    Day, Canada)</p>
  <p >Finally, Bryan Kennedy from <em>Science Buzz</em>, which
    is also accessible through kiosks on the museum floor at Science Museum of
    Minnesota, shared this:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Visit times internally (on the floor of the museum) have
    been much higher than we expected and on-par with more hands-on full body
    interactives. We have continued to grow steadily in visitation since the
    site's launch. The number one way people reach our site is through specific
    content-focused searches. A blog style format allows us to have the narrow
    focus on topics across a broad range of topics that benefits this sort of
    Internet audience.</p>
  <p >When it comes to challenges, sustainability is by far
    the primary concern of the bloggers surveyed (see Table 2.4). This not surprising
    as we&rsquo;ve already learned that less one in five museum blogs have any kind
    of direct funding. Institutional support, spam, and hate speech were also
    listed as concerns for some bloggers. </p>

  <h2>Future Directions</h2>
  <p >Our final survey question was, &ldquo;What are your plans for
    the blog over the next 6 months? The next year?&rdquo; This question, perhaps more
    than other in the survey, elicited many similar responses. While a few shared
    concerns about a lack of time or continuing funding, most shared plans for
    continuing their blog and even for expanding it.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">&ldquo;I just plan to continue blogging - let the core committee
    worry about directional issues. We are inviting new voices to blog in an
    attempt to engage young professionals&rdquo;<strong>  (</strong>Holly Witchey, Museumatic,
    USA).</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">&ldquo;I will be blogging more often and starting to include
    other online museum resources such as discussion lists and podcasts&rdquo; (MuseumGuru,
    Anita Cohen, USA).</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">&ldquo;Keep up with developments and make changes as and when
    needed. Find some more contributors. Install WordPress mu (MultiUser) for
    all staff members to use (60+) and broaden our reach&rdquo; (Dan Pett, Portable
    Antiques, United Kingdom)</p>
  <p >While continuation and even expansion were common threads,
    a few respondents looked to work on expanding the community aspects of their
    blogs.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">&ldquo;Continue what we're doing. We'd like to add more rich
    media if possible, and perhaps do more in the way of &quot;community&rdquo; (Brent
    Gustaf, New Media Initiatives, USA).</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote"> We are working on enhancing the community aspects of our
    blog. We have seen a need for more personalization around our content. This
    will involve more developed user and author profiles. Using this info we
    will build ways for users to find stories that will interest them most. We
    also know that if we want to build a community around the discussions happening
    on Science Buzz we need to remove all technical barriers to the user participating
    in this discussion  (Bryan Kennedy, Science Buzz, USA).</p>
  <p >Zeke from <em>Zeke&rsquo;s Gallery</em>  summed up the thoughts
    of many museum bloggers, as far as the future is concerned: &ldquo;Bigger, more,
    faster, better.&rdquo;<strong> </strong></p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p >Museum blogging is maturing and is becoming an accepted
    (and unfunded!) communication platform. From an operational standpoint, the
    team approach to blogging that <em>Museumatic</em>, <em>Hanging Together</em>, <em>New
      Media Initiatives</em>, and others have developed scored highly in most of
    our measures. Due to its distributed nature it is perhaps the most sustainable
    as well. These blogs, and others in the top of the visitation rankings, also
    tend to deliver focused and consistent content to their target audience.
    In addition, they tend to allow and encourage audience participation through
    comments.</p>
  <p >The success of &lsquo;semi-automated&rsquo; blogs such <em>Botany Photo
      of the Day</em><em> </em>and <em>Andy
      Warhol Blog</em><em> </em>provide
      an interesting model that many museums can explore at low cost and with
      minimal resources. One could easily imagine a <strong>collection item of the
      day</strong> from an art or history museum. We&rsquo;ve already seen the Rijksmuseum
      and the American Museum of Natural History develop Apple and Yahoo! Widgets
      (Urban, 2006) that work in much the same way. Putting this information
      in a blog format seems a natural next step.</p>
  <p >While blogs have great potential for marketing, those
    that have a strong marketing focus are far from the most popular, according
    our surveys. Providing blog visitors with more than just marketing information
    helps build and retain an audience, and thus an interest in those things
    one wishes to &lsquo;market&rsquo; (Barnes, 2005). However, for many marketing departments,
    blogging software can be a cheap means to attaining the productivity and
    workflow outcomes of a content management system, with RSS feeds and other
    highly desirable features. Perhaps comparing these &lsquo;marketing blogs&rsquo; with
    traditional static marketing Web pages would be a better measure.</p>
  <p >The survey and the response to it reveals an emerging
    museum blogging community. More than 60 percent of the known museum blogs
    participated in the survey. Many museum bloggers comment on each other&rsquo;s
    postings and, as the survey revealed, over 80 percent link to other museum
    blogs. Anecdotally, the two authors of this paper &lsquo;met&rsquo; while commenting
    on each other&rsquo;s blogs, and agreed to conduct this survey and write this paper
    without first meeting in person.</p>
  <p > As the museum blogosphere continues its rapid development,
    it is hoped that this community will strengthen. The rapid growth that we
    will experience (at the current rate, we&rsquo;ll have over 200 museum blogs by
    the fall of 2007) will bring new ideas and models to share and learn from.
    We look forward to the continuing conversation.</p>
