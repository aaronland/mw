      <p class="AbstractText">Traditional history relies on the ability to review
        hundreds or thousands of relevant documents and artifacts. Using Web
        2.0 tools, an archive can now gather those objects on-line, creating
        an historical record broader and deeper than ever before possible. In
        conceiving its &quot;Katrina's Jewish Voices&quot; project in late 2005,
        the Jewish Women's Archive realized that it was not enough to create
        a &quot;raw archive&quot; of such objects. For digital preservation we
        require assurances of fixity, as well as the capture of significant metadata
        about objects, their contributors and creators (where possible), and
        about the relationships between complex objects. In this project, we
        made good progress towards these goals and made a major step forward
        in our goal of becoming and exemplifying the &quot;Archive for the 21st
        century.&quot;</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The Jewish Women&rsquo;s Archive (JWA), founded in November 1995, grew
      out of the recognition that neither the historical record preserved in
      America&rsquo;s Jewish archives nor that preserved in its women&rsquo;s
      archives accurately or adequately represented the complexity of Jewish
      women&rsquo;s lives and experiences over the three centuries in which they
      had been making history in the United States. (JWA, 2006)</p>
    <p>The Archive&rsquo;s mission is to &ldquo;uncover, chronicle, and transmit
      the rich history of American Jewish women.&rdquo; That includes a commitment
      to documenting Jewish women from all walks of life, and to reaching out
      to the general public, as well as to scholars. Uniquely, JWA does not maintain
      physical archives. Rather, from its inception, the commitment has been
      to present information on-line, available at any time to anyone with access
      to the Internet.</p>
    <p>Collaboration has also been a key part of the Archive&rsquo;s work. Initial
      JWA projects grew out of collaboration with MIT&rsquo;s Center for Educational
      Computing Initiatives and resulted in profiles of significant &ldquo;Women
      of Valor,&rdquo; as well as a database, the &ldquo;Virtual Archive&rdquo; containing
      information about where to find the papers of hundreds of significant Jewish
      women. In 2005 we teamed up the University of Michigan to use OCR and new
      indexing technology to make the full text of <em>The American Jewess,</em> the
      first American periodical for Jewish women, accessible and searchable over
      the Web. That same year we also launched a new type of exhibit, &ldquo;Jewish
      Women and the Feminist Revolution&rdquo; in which the women profiled were
      asked to determine the relevant artifacts to be digitized for inclusion
      in the exhibit. That freedom to choose enabled us to present a variety
      of documents and digitized artifacts that would never otherwise have been
      presented.</p>
    <p>The Archive has long been active in gathering oral histories, as well.
      In addition to exhibits profiling communities in Baltimore and Seattle,
      the Archive has undertaken numerous smaller oral history projects, including
      a popular series, &ldquo;Women Who Dared,&rdquo; featured both on our Web
      site and in events held in several cities in the United States, including
      New Orleans.</p>
    <h1>Katrina&rsquo;s Jewish Voices</h1>
    <p>Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath profoundly changed communities along
      the Gulf Coast and in New Orleans. The Jewish communities were also changed,
      but in ways that reflected and accelerated shifts that had begun in those
      communities decades ago. To capture those communities&rsquo; history and
      changes, JWA joined forces with the Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern
      Jewish Life (ISJL) to conduct 100 in-depth oral histories with members
      of the Jewish communities of New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and the Gulf Coast.
      In addition, we partnered with the Center for History and New Media (CHNM)
      to create a Web site to help capture the stories more broadly, using on-line
      collecting. This paper is about that on-line collecting project.</p>
    <p>By this time, CHNM had been involved with on-line collecting for over
      half a decade. Starting with their 9/11 on-line collecting site (CHNM,
      2001), the organization had literally written the book on on-line collecting
      (Cohen &amp; Rosenzweig, 2005).</p>
    <p>CHNM projects focused on providing a comfortable user interface buttressed
      by the latest in Web2.0 technologies. They were early to use AJAX to simplify
      the form, inviting site visitors to contribute stories and digital items
      on-line, and similarly early in using a mashup with Google Maps to provide
      a map-based interface to browsing. For this project, they added the ability
      to categorize items using folksonomic tags. The tags could be added by
      the original item contributors, by registered users on the site, and by
      the JWA administrative site on the back end.</p>
    <p>As is the case with <em>all</em> on-line history projects, outreach would
      be essential. Throughout the project, CHNM staff warned us that outreach
      would be the critical requirement for populating the archive: &ldquo;If
      you build it, they will not come.&rdquo; They also provided invaluable
      and ongoing advice in holding workshops and outreach sessions in various
      communities.</p>
    <h1>The Back End Challenges</h1>
    <p>There were three major components to the back end of the system: administration,
      users, and data. Each posed special challenges. </p>
    <h2>Digital Preservation</h2>
    <p>The back end of the site was an interesting cross between a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Web
      site Content Management System (CMS) and a Digital Asset Management System
      (DAMS). For Content Management, we had to ask ourselves questions about
      what would appear on the Web and how:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What workflow was required to vet and approve materials, or to remove
        materials if problems were discovered?</li>
      <li>How would we handle materials which were for researchers only? </li>
      <li>Which items would appear as &ldquo;featured items,&rdquo; etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The DAM side had longer-term implications. Digital Asset Management, buttressed
      by appropriate policies and procedures, carried out successfully and predictably
      over time, is Digital Preservation. To do this well, we had to ensure that
      we captured all appropriate technical, personal, and descriptive metadata.
      We also had to provide assurance of fixity - to ensure that what we were
      presenting was, in fact, what had been contributed, and that nothing had
      been changed or corrupted over time. </p>
    <p>The fixity issue is of significant importance. I had personal awareness
      of how slippery digital provenance could be. About 20 years ago, I typeset
      a book about Kurt Waldheim. One of the photo exhibits for the book was
      a copy of Waldheim&rsquo;s indictment after WWII by the UN. The document
      we received was unreadable. It looked as though it had been faxed and copied
      a few too many times. An early software package to edit image bitmaps had
      just been released. We carefully researched how the text might have read
      had it been readable, and then used SuperPaint to make it so. The result
      made a much better impression on casual readers, but was no more &ldquo;true&rdquo; than
      the photoshopped images passed around after 9/11 purporting to show the
      planes about to hit the Twin Towers. </p>
    <p>As historical artifacts, it was fine for the archive to receive photoshopped
      images. We have no way of usefully vetting authenticity. But it is essential
      that we be able to prove that what we display (or the original of what
      we display) is exactly what was submitted - that each object has neither
      been altered nor corrupted.</p>
    <p>Digital Preservation workflow and processes involve several automated
      steps. This is an area where entering data by hand takes time, and is prone
      to mistake. In larger systems, tools such as JHOVE (http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/)
      can be used to extract technical information from digital objects as they
      are submitted. This information includes what type of object has been submitted,
      as well as compliance with the standard for that object (i.e., the file
      appears to be a JPEG, but is that really the case? Is anything wrong with
      the object?). In our case, we used a smaller open source module, as customized
      by the CHNM project team. </p>
    <p>In the original data model for the Web site, we initially followed CHNM&rsquo;s
      lead in creating categories called &ldquo;online text&rdquo; and &ldquo;online
      file&rdquo;. The reason for segregating content created using our Web site
      lies with the second category: &ldquo;online file.&rdquo; Since we don&rsquo;t
      ask contributors technical information (nor do we expect most on-line contributors
      to be sufficiently computer-savvy to reliably know such information), it
      seemed initially safest to segregate such items. But our backend system <em>does</em> know
      what it has received - we derive that information as part of the automated
      technical information extraction process. By segregating some objects as &ldquo;online
      file,&rdquo; we complicate site visitor&rsquo;s ability to find objects.
      How will our site visitors know that cousin Janet&rsquo;s pictures aren&rsquo;t
      categorized as &ldquo;still images&rdquo; (which we might have further
      simplified to &ldquo;photos&rdquo; or &ldquo;photos/images&rdquo;) but &ldquo;online
      files&rdquo;? As part of &ldquo;lessons learned,&rdquo; we are currently
      changing that functionality to eliminate the &ldquo;online&rdquo; categories.</p>
    <p>For &ldquo;fixity&rdquo; - assurance that what we were holding is what
      was submitted - we insisted on changes to the original CHNM processes.
      First, the upload software calculates a &ldquo;checksum,&rdquo; which is
      a unique digital fingerprint of the submitted file. The software then records
      the date and time at which the file was received. Subsequently, work done
      through the administration tools will also automatically record the &ldquo;last
      modified&rdquo; date. By regularly checking that the file generates the
      same checksum, we know that it has not been modified. By looking at the
      creation and last-modified dates on the archive&rsquo;s file system, and
      comparing those with what is stored in the file metadata, we have further
      assurance of the file&rsquo;s integrity over time.</p>
    <p>It is also worth noting that the fact that we take these elaborate precautions
      to ensure that the original file (or files, in the case of an aggregate
      object - see below) is not altered does not mean that we present the original
      file to archive visitors. In some cases this is simply not possible: a
      URL pointing to a Web site might point to entirely different content tomorrow,
      and might look entirely different when viewed with tomorrow&rsquo;s Web
      browser technology. We preserve Web pages as we can, and present the &ldquo;look
      and feel&rdquo; on the public archive via Acrobat PDF. Similarly, we do
      not present Word documents, but rather first create Acrobat PDFs. Over
      time, part of our Digital Preservation effort will include deciding when/if
      to migrate files or how to otherwise continue to ensure usability (where
      possible) of the original bitstream. In other cases, where people contribute
      files that have no common Web analog (image TIFFs, for instance), we create
      JPEG or GIF files for Web display, as appropriate. We are also looking
      at techniques for better preserving the look and feel of complex Web sites
      using technologies such as MPEG 21 (Smith &amp; Nelson, 2007).</p>
    <p>In addition to the data automatically generated when an item is uploaded,
      there is object type-specific data that is accessed via an AJAX controlled
      administration form.</p>

      once &ldquo;email&rdquo; has been selected from the dropdown menu.</p>
    <h2>Users - or People, in General</h2>
    <p>In a typical CMS or DAM, &ldquo;Users&rdquo; are the people with authorization
      to use the system. Depending on what role has been assigned to the users,
      they may be able to view objects, edit them, or even alter the system.
      Typically, these administrative users are also entirely different from
      the people who contribute the objects that are being managed. In our case,
      this model was different, and the roles were much more complex.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Public</li>
      <li>Researcher</li>
      <li>Admin</li>
      <li>Superuser</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;This was familiar territory, but we did not notice during our original
      planning that we were building something that was more complex than previous
      CHNM Web sites. Some of the new features didn&rsquo;t matter: for instance,
      the fact that <strong>Public</strong> could now potentially include people
      who didn&rsquo;t also appear in the <strong>Contributors</strong> table
      was minor. Some people contributed items on-line. Some people registered
      with the site so that they could mark favorite items in <em>MyArchive</em> and
      add their tags to objects as seemed appropriate. Mistakes were made in
      failing to carefully consider two things.</p>
    <p>First, some contributors use our on-line collecting interface. Because
      we require only an e-mail address and a name from on-line contributors,
      we do not collect an explicit <strong>login id</strong>. There is no reason
      not to use the e-mail address as login id, and many good reasons to do
      so. But, by habit, we think of administration as requiring a login, and
      in building the admin side of the site, we had created a specific field
      for login. Thus, we have two login patterns. These patterns are further
      complicated by the fact that when contributing on-line - doing exactly
      what we were hoping people would do - individuals didn&rsquo;t get the
      opportunity to set a password. So, if we succeed in making fans out of
      our contributors and they come back to collect favorites, or to contribute
      more items, they have no way of actually logging in. Worse, if they try
      to contribute again without logging in, the original site software notes
      that the contributor&rsquo;s e-mail address matches one already on file.
      The logic insists that our contributor is registered on the site and must
      not log in. The solution is to rethink user-related id and password issues.
      We&rsquo;ll use e-mail addresses as logins, and will be sending new contributors
      the appropriate login information and system-generated &ldquo;starter passwords&rdquo; as
      part of the message that informs them that their contribution has been
      received and tells them how to view it.</p>
    <p>A second set of problems arose when we realized that there were three
      different contribution-related roles, not one: contributor, creator, and
      collector. Any user role from Public to Superuser can be attached to a
      login that also appears in what we are now calling the <strong>People</strong> table
      - the table of people who are involved in the creation, collection, or
      contribution of items to the database. Where the original design had us
      entering <strong>creator</strong> or <strong>collector</strong> names into
      a text field, whether or not the names were already in our database, we
      will finally have a way to prevent typos, on the one hand, and to record
      information about the person on the other.</p>
    <p>When we receive an on-line contribution (<a href="../http://katrina.jwa.org/contribute/%20" target="_blank">http://katrina.jwa.org/contribute/ </a>),
      all that we <em>require</em> of the contributor is that he or she give
      us a name, a verifiable e-mail address, and permission to use the object(s).
      What we want, of course, is much more. We have had reasonable success in
      getting that information from our on-line contributors, as well as from
      people who submit items via email, CD ROM, or other media.</p>
    <p>The additional information - metadata - includes several pieces of information
      about the object: a description, whether or not the contributor created
      the object (and if not, who did),&nbsp; what location (using Google Maps
      or a form) the object refers to, the date to which the object refers, and
      even tags. This object metadata is presumed to apply to each individual
      item that someone contributes in a given session, whether they type in
      one story, upload one file, or upload several files. Such metadata, like
      the metadata we gather about the objects themselves, would be the same
      for any on-line collecting project.</p>
    <p>Once we have the contribution, plus whatever object metadata the contributor
      chooses to enter, we ask for permission to use the object, and then for
      an e-mail address, and a name. At this point, we have enough information
      to accept the item. Nonetheless, we do want to know more about each contributor. </p>
    <p>Much of the personal metadata that we gather is unique to this project.
      This is the part of the form that changes with each project. We ask obvious
      questions such as occupation, age, gender, and religious affiliation. We
      also ask whether or not the person lived in New Orleans at the time of
      the hurricane, and if so, where they evacuated to, where they have been
      since, and whether they plan to return. If they didn&rsquo;t live in New
      Orleans, we ask how they came to be involved. The form is mediated using
      AJAX so that people only see parts of the form that are relevant to their
      answers. If they change answers, the form will change to suit. (On the
      administration side, we use similar AJAX constructions to navigate contributor
      information.) We not only wanted to simplify each person&rsquo;s experience
      so that they see only questions relevant to their self-identification,
      but also wanted them to be able to explore without having to start over.</p>
    <p class="caption"><a href="davidow.fig3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="davidow.fig3a.jpg" alt="Fig 3" width="370" height="328" border="0" /></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig. 3: Tell Us More</p>
    <p>Once the required minimum information has been gathered, a contributor
      can choose to submit the contribution, or to tell us more. In either case,
      AJAX us used to shape the form based on the contributor&rsquo;s responses.</p>
    <p>In most cases, we receive submissions indirectly - not through the site.
      We then follow up using e-mail to gather that additional personal metadata.</p>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>If there was an area that highlighted the difference between &ldquo;good
      enough to get usable material on-line,&rdquo; aka &ldquo;raw archives&rdquo; and
      our attempts at setting up a system that would support asset management
      and preservation, getting a handle on &ldquo;objects&rdquo; was it. In
      the CHNM model, items are contributed one at a time. In some cases, items
      are united by considering them &ldquo;collections&rdquo;, but in most cases
      there is no easy way to view related objects as a group. This is a common
      DAM issue. How does one indicate that the 10 images used for a VRML presentation
      of a museum asset are one &ldquo;object&rdquo;? How does one indicate that
      these 5 items are part of a set? In our case, we knew from the start that &ldquo;Object&rdquo; could
      not be a synonym for &ldquo;file,&rdquo; just as there had to be collections,
      sub-collections, meta-collections, and the like. The example we used most
      often was an e-mail with attachments: pictures, for instance.</p>
    <h3>We simply got it wrong. </h3>
    <p>We spent several weeks at the beginning of the project working on content
      models, and CHNM did a great job of coming up with terms and metadata,
      primarily based on Dublin Core, to describe the various object types, generalized
      object metadata, and relationships among items. But CHNM, up to this point,
      had been doing &ldquo;instant history&rdquo; and gathering &ldquo;raw archives.&rdquo; They
      had only captured this metadata in text fields, even significant items
      such as &ldquo;unique ID&rdquo; and &ldquo;upload date.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Implementing the metadata in meaningful ways that would contribute to
      Digital Preservation was significantly more complex than any prior on-line
      collecting site our vendor had built, and we simply got it wrong. We did
      not sufficiently understand how to set up the application to indicate and
      enforce relationships such that specific file metadata could be easily
      stored and edited on the file level without getting in the way of&nbsp; &ldquo;Object&rdquo; metadata
      that might have similar metadata descriptors. &ldquo;Creator&rdquo; or &ldquo;creation
      date&rdquo; or &ldquo;location&rdquo; might refer to a specific &ldquo;object&rdquo; (what
      we now call a &ldquo;working copy&rdquo;) as a whole, or to specific parts
      (which we now call &ldquo;items&rdquo;). When a group of items is contributed
      in a single on-line session, that metadata will apply both to the working
      copy, and to its component items. As we look forward to coming&nbsp; projects,
      this is the area that will change the most. We just didn&rsquo;t have the
      archivist&rsquo; or librarians&rsquo; knowledge that would have made obvious
      the need for being able to record component attributes separately from
      aggregations, nor did the programmer have experience with models that involved
      relationships more complex than could be indicated in a series of metadata
      text fields. </p>
    <h3>Levels of Aggregation/Distinction</h3>
    <p>For the record, we think we recognize the need for at least four levels
      of aggregation/distinction:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong class="listwithnumbers">item</strong> - this is the individual
        file - the smallest component of something</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithnumbers">working copy</strong> - this is one
        or more items that form a working object - that e-mail with attachments,
        or the set of images+xml in a VRML set</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithnumbers">subcollection</strong> - this is used
        to collect items in a set or session; in the KJV context, this might
        be used to represent all items created by one person, or in one session,
        from a collection, as well. </li>
      <li><strong class="listwithnumbers">collection </strong>- this is used
        to collect items contributed or collected by one person or organization.
        In KJV terms, this could be the set of items gathered by one of the local
        Jewish communal groups</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Items can belong to more than one working copy, subcollection, or collection.</p>
    <p>A good explanation of these levels has been provided recently by Leslie
      Johnston, Head of Digital Access Services at the University of Virginia,
      at the Open Repositories Conference 2007, in San Antonio (Johnston, 2007).</p>
    <p>In addition to the complex relationships, it is important to recognize
      that metadata&nbsp; is best stored and maintained in a variety of ways.
      Text fields are to be avoided where possible. </p>
    <p>In some cases, the application should be gathering the metadata (especially
      for items such as the item checksum, upload date, last-modified date; and
      hopefully for all technical metadata). Some dates do need to be entered
      by humans (On what date did this event occur?), but they also need to be
      stored as dates in the database, not as text, and the form design needs
      to provide affordances such that dates are entered consistently, correctly.
      Without enforcing &ldquo;date&rdquo; attributes, it is impossible to do
      any date-related searches or browses (What was uploaded in the last two
      months? Do we have items pegged to the Katrina commemoration on August
      29, 2006?). </p>
    <p>In the case of repeatable information, such as the people who create,
      contribute, or collect items, their names need to be selected from a list,
      or verified against a list with a request for &ldquo;Person&rdquo; metadata
      when a new name is encountered. It is not a good thing to have the same
      person in the database more than once. Even worse is to have that person&rsquo;s
      name indicated by variant spellings. (If we were gathering old documents,
      such variances are common, and are resolved using something called an &ldquo;Authority
      file.&rdquo; Such files indicate the &ldquo;authoritative&rdquo; spelling
      of a name or a term. In the age of relational databases, where the data
      are under the control of a single organization, there is no justification
      for such drift.) </p>
    <p>Relationships between objects similarly need to be defined or verified
      from a pick list, not keyed in. Without such constraints, one winds up
      with objects having unique relationships: isPartOf, isChildOf. </p>
    <h3>Duplicate File Names</h3>
    <p>There is one last, minor issue that we encountered: how to deal with duplicate
      file names. Files are stored in the Web server&rsquo;s file system rather
      than inside the database. This is usually much easier to maintain and back
      up than otherwise, but creates a problem when more than one file is submitted
      with the same file name. (This can happen either because more than one
      person uploads the same file, or because some names are natural choices
      when subjects are similar.) The usual practice when encountering a new
      file using an already extant name is to add a number. So, the first file
      might be called &ldquo;overturned car.jpg&rdquo;. The next time around,
      you store the file as &ldquo;overturned car1.jpg&rdquo; (as well as the
      original filename for fixity purposes). In the first iteration of <em>Katrina&rsquo;s
      Jewish Voices</em> we decided to be overly clever and included part of
      the checksum in the filenames. This means that a file received as &ldquo;ZAKA
      torah photo_1.jpg&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;ZAKA torah photo_1_1f8ee628f1.jpg.&rdquo; The
      extra work complicates some file maintenance, complicates the 
      usability of the files when downloaded, and gets very much in the way of
       debugging.</p>
    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
    <p>Gathering raw archival data would not have been sufficient to meet the
      needs of the Jewish Women&rsquo;s Archive&rsquo;s mandate. Working with
      the Center for History and New Media, we succeeded in extending their vision
      of on-line collecting while also taking advantage of CHNM&rsquo;s experience
      in the subject and meeting very tight deadlines. In true Web2.0 fashion,
      we are already working on a new iteration of the Katrina site which should
      be available by Spring 2007. </p>
    <p>Automation is the key to sanity and success. Had we not automated the
      gathering of technical metadata, we would have no reasonable way of ensuring
      fixity, nor would we have a reasonable way of handling the hundreds of
      items currently backlogged. Future projects will want to include good tools
      for dealing with batches of items at a time. </p>
    <p>As we plan for a full-fledged DAMS, ensuring that maximum metadata is
      generated by automated tools is something we think about a lot. We&rsquo;re
      not ready to try automating descriptive data, but to the degree that humans
      don&rsquo;t have to do things such as indicate file size or type, or manually
      type in dates that can be generated by the computer, the greater degree
      that such data is likely to be accurate. That accuracy is an essential
      part of our plan to create the full suite of tools, policies and procedures
      required for a Trusted Digital Repository.</p>
    <p>The biggest thing we learned is the vast gap between &ldquo;raw archive&rdquo; and
      Digital Preservation. Since this project was initiated, one staff member
      has completed a course in managing digital preservation and we have hired
      a digital archivist. At the same time, we need to acknowledge that the
      project succeeded. This Web site is used by a growing number of people
      and is attracting exponentially increasing quantities of contributions.
      The tool is sufficiently successful to encourage use and revision. To me,
      this strongly reinforces the desirability of undertaking projects in short,
      iterative steps. If we had waited until we knew what we know now, we would
      still not be on-line, and many of the materials we have collected would
      already be lost.</p>
    <p>It is also true that we would not have succeeded as well as we did without
      the meticulous Content Model definition and workflow analysis that preceded
      the actual design and coding. This leads me to a favorite issue: project
      management. When one is creating a very simple Web site from a well-known
      template, project management can be fairly casual. It is absolutely critical
      that both my own organization and our future vendors are both grounded
      in professional project management practice. A simple, full-semester project
      management course is enough to learn professional vocabulary and norms
      and to begin to understand what Project Management is. But without some
      basic professional Project Management skills, it is impossible for staff
      to break a project down and discover what they do not know, <em>early</em>,
      and to effectively solve problems before they affect schedule, scope, or
      cost. Although I remain convinced that having one project management professional
      on one team should be enough, my experience suggests that each partner
      to the collaboration needs the skills. Without such skills, miscommunication
      and inadequate management flourish. Where this project underachieved, this
      is where the problem lay.</p>
    <p>Finally, as we look forward, it occurs to us that a single on-line collection
      Website is always going to be a hard sell. It will always require significant
      effort to reach out to people and to get the first contributors to participate.
      We are looking hard at ways to make our MyArchive tools easier to use,
      and to generalize them throughout the JWA Web site. As we build on the
      success of <em>Katrina&rsquo;s Jewish Voices</em> and create new on-line
      collecting projects, we should also be creating a community interested
      in the Jewish Women&rsquo;s Archive. As that develops, we will find ourselves
      with a core group of people who participate regularly. They might be using
      Web site forums, sharing tags, commenting on blog posts. They will be familiar
      with us, and comfortable being those first contributors on new projects.
      We believe that this will nudge us gradually into a virtuous cycle in which
      participation brings more participation.</p>
    <p>As William H. Whyte noted years ago (Whyte 1988), people like to be where
      people are.&nbsp; If JWA is to succeed in its mission of uncovering and
      transmitting history, we must focus not just on new ways of gathering information
      and artifacts. We need to ensure that we provide affordances such that
      our Web site becomes a place &ldquo;where people are.&rdquo;</p>
