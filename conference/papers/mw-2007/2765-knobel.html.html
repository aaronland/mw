  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p><em>NanoAventura</em> (NanoAdventure) is the first exhibition organized by
    the new Science Museum of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in the
    city of Campinas, state of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. It was opened to the public
    in April 2005, and during its first year of operation was exhibited in the
    Brazilian cities of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Porto Alegre (RS), S&atilde;o Paulo (SP)
    and Campinas (SP), and had over 25,000 visitors. The exhibition was developed
    in partnership with the Sinchrotron Light National Laboratory (LNLS) and
    the Sangari Institute, both Brazilian institutions. The project received
    financial support from the Vitae Foundation and the State of S&atilde;o Paulo Foundation
    for Research Support (FAPESP), as well as the patronage and support of other
    partners.</p>
  <p>The proposal was to create an interactive exhibit that would attract the
    interest of children and teenagers (9 to14 years old) to nanoscience and
    nanotechnology by generating a space for learning and entertainment. With
    this perspective, <em>NanoAventura</em> was conceived as an invitation to explore
    the nanoscopic world in a playful fashion through images, music and simulations. </p>
  <p><strong>Nanoscience</strong> is currently referred to as a new science. However, the
    study of elements on a nanometric scale existed before being denominated
    as such. The development of appropriate instruments to observe and manipulate
    these elements has had a strong push in the last two decades, leading to
    the emergence of a new technology with its share of promises and uncertainties. </p>
  <p><strong>Nanotechnology</strong> is the engineering of materials from atoms and molecules,
    making it possible to use the results of nanoscience in order to manipulate
    and reorganize nanoparticles and thus promote other combinations and thus
    elaborate new materials and devices. This is an emerging technology that
    is among the science and technology, investment priorities which have exponentially
    multiplied in the last decade (Stephens, 2005) but which, according to research
    in this field in different countries, is still far from the concerns and
    interests of the greater part of the population.</p>
  <h2>A Web Site For An Exhibition Under Construction</h2>
  <p>The first Web site created for the NanoAventura project was conceived during
    the process of creation of the exhibition itself, with a rather broad perspective
    and without a clear picture of its main utilization. Should it be a Web site
    to be used by the eventual partners and patrons, and therefore should it
    have a strong institutional appeal? Should it be for visitors (or potential
    visitors) of NanoAventura to search for more information regarding nanoscience
    and nanotechnology? Or should it be for those same visitors who are looking
    for a means to continue the ludic-interactive experience they started during
    the in-person visit to the project? Should it be for Web surfers looking
    for information available in Portuguese on nanoscience and nanotechnology?</p>
  <p>At that initial moment it was not possible to answer all such questions,
    because we did not even know what the impact and acceptation of the exhibition
    itself would be. However, the proposal to create a site from the beginning,
    even knowing it might not have the ideal format, was aimed to create a fundamental
    communication channel, not only to promote the project, but also to make
    available several extra resources on the complex subject that the exhibition
    was designed to show and discuss. </p>
  <p>The initial site was created in a traditional format with five areas: </p>
  <ol>
  <li>NanoAventura,
    in which there was information on the history of the project, credits, booking
    and agenda; </li>
  <li>NanoWorld
    with bibliography, interviews, etc.; </li>
  <li>Support
    resources, such as didactic materials for teachers, and other digital materials;</li>
 <li>A
    press section, with clippings and press-releases, and finally </li>
 <li>A
    section with a description of the partners and supporters of the project. </li>
 </ol>
  <p>There was also a contact form, which was the only communication channel
    available to the visitors. </p>
  <h2>Immediately at least two problems were identified. </h2>
  <h3>Problems and Solutions</h3>
  <p>The first problem was related to the hierarchy of information provided.
    Although it was not so clear at the design stage, it became obvious when
    the project was maturing that one of the main uses of the site was for prospective
    visitors looking for practical information such as place, hours, how to arrive,
    price, booking information, calendar, etc. In the initial site there was
    no special space for such kinds of information. In an attempt to solve this
    problem, we added some ad-hoc space for practical news and some links, and
    eventually a pop-up window. However, we knew that the problem was yet to
    be solved.</p>
  <p>The second problem was the lack of agility for updating information in a
    project that from the very beginning had a stretched working team. This lack
    of speed was eventually detrimental because it resulted in bad communication
    with the public, both from the practical and additional resources viewpoints.
    Some updates were performed, but the use of static HTML pages was a major
    drawback for the team formed by non-IT specialists. The development team
    was clamoring for tools that would allow the democratization of contributions to the Web site, avoiding an excess of bureaucratization and hierarchy in the expected dynamic content of the Web site. </p>
  <p>However, in order to have real interactivity with users, we needed something
    else. We wanted somehow to provide navigation throughout the site to extend
    the exhibit experience in which, according to the evaluation performed, games
    were the major attractions for our target audience. Within this context,
    new games were designed developed for the Web site (see below). </p>
  <p>Another problematic aspect of the initial site was the aesthetics that did
    not reflect the strong visual appeal of the exhibition itself. Therefore,
    with the exhibition already running, a new Web site began to be delineated.
    This proposal needed to consider the previously related points: organizing
    information hierarchically, providing update facility and agility, recovering
    interactive aspects of the project, and following a layout and visual design
    closer to the exhibition itself.</p>
  <h2>Interface Architecture and Communication Structure of the New Web Site</h2>
  <p>What kind of site did we need? The discussion regarding the new Web site
    of the NanoAventura project started with really basic definitions and main
    objectives. There was an institutional character to show and diffuse through
    the exhibition, keeping in mind the basic idea of using the site as a channel
    to make scientific content also available. Therefore the project was designed
    with two main environments:</p>
	<ul>
  <li><strong>NanoAventura</strong> <strong>(NanoAdventure</strong>):
    This contains information regarding the exhibition, both institutional and
    operational, such as the calendar, support material, research, evaluation
    data, clippings, etc., also with new on-line games.</li>
  <li> <strong>NanoMundo
      (NanoWorld</strong>).. This a simple blog that allows the discussion and popularization
      of nanoscience and nanotechnology.</li>
	  </ul>
  <p>Both areas display a similar basic structure. At the top of each of the
    sections is an interactive box where the on-line games are located. In the
    case of NanoAventura, additional information related to the exhibition is
    also displayed. Below this interactive box, wider content is shown. For both
    areas, the main idea is always to show at the top of the page a rather interactive
    communication with nice illustrations. However, each section has well
    defined characteristics that were fundamental to the detailed design of each
    structure. While NanoAventura is unidirectional, and information is produced
    by the team of the Science Museum of UNICAMP to show to the public, NanoWorld
    is bidirectional, and allows the exchange of information both between the
    development team and the visitors, and among the visitors themselves. The
    entire Web site has a Web-based Content Management System (CMS) that allows
    Museum staff to edit and add texts, images, documents, tags.</p>
  <h3>NanoAventura (NanoAdventure)</h3>
  <p>The design of the main environment predicated that several pieces of information
    should be presented simultaneously. The idea was to break down the traditional
    Web page concept that is directly related to the press media (Manovich, 2001).
    Instead of an alphabetically ordered menu to provide access to just one piece
    of information, different pieces of information are presented together, creating
    a concept similar to an environment rather than a printed page (Prado, 2006).
    At the top of the screen, interactivity predominates: the visitor, through
    a video, images and a map, can &ldquo;visit&rdquo; the exhibition with rather good detail.
    Also in this area are two on-line games inspired by the games of the exhibition
    itself: as in the case of the exhibition, they allow the public to have first
    contact with the nanoscience world by playing.</p>
  <p>Although this section is usually employed as a one-way communication channel
    between the Museum and the public,  there is the possibility of inserting
    opinions and comments that can be shown if approved by the Webmaster or museum
    team.</p>

    <a href="../http://www.mc.unicamp.br/nanoaventura" target="_blank">http://www.mc.unicamp.br/nanoaventura</a> </p>
  <h3>NanoMundo (NanoWorld)</h3>
  <p>The structural idea for the NanoWorld area started from the concept of a
    blog, a simple interface that would allow the insertion of news, articles,
    interviews, images, links, and that would also allow public participation
    through opinions, comments, suggestions and questions. However, the conventional
    tools found in a blog were not enough for the project. The text organization
    in a temporal history &ndash; weeks, months, years &ndash; would not allow a more specific
    search. Thus, for each insertion of a piece of content in NanoWorld, there
    are several indexers that construct the search system developed specifically
    for this blog. The index is predetermined by the Museum team. As  NanoWorld
    is a search system, it was important to develop tools for a rather broad
    search. It is worth noting that each visitor can build a personal NanoWorld
    by choosing the type of information, the theme and the ordering of information
    to be presented.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="knobel.fig2.jpg" alt="Fig 2: The Home Page of the Project NanoAventura. NanoWorld ambient. http://www.mc.unicamp.br/nanoaventura/nanoMundo/index.php" width="394" height="274" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 2: The Home Page of the Project NanoAventura. NanoWorld
    ambient. <a href="../http://www.mc.unicamp.br/nanoaventura/nanoMundo/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.mc.unicamp.br/nanoaventura/nanoMundo/index.php</a></p>
  <p>The information is divided into five categories<strong>: opinion</strong>, <strong>articles,
      interviews,</strong> <strong>bibliography</strong>, and <strong>other.</strong> The
    &ldquo;opinions&rdquo; are any comments inserted by visitors, while the other categories
    are inserted by the Museum team. The themes are dynamic, and can be edited
    and created through the CMS.</p>
  <p>The format of the answers to a specific search are not similar to the traditional
    format of a blog. We tried a mixed response between a search system (with
    the respective answers) and the blogs (with the respective content presentation).
    In the blogs, even if there is content paging, the last information of each
    page remains distant from quick access, and some scrolling is necessary to
    reach it. Also, two interesting and related pieces of information can remain
    distant one from the other, a fact that can hinder reading. Therefore, at
    NanoWorld, the result of a search is presented only with title, date and
    type of information (not showing the content) &ndash;
    similar to traditional search systems. Thus, initially one looks for information
    through the title, to go deep into the content afterwards. If the visitor
    opts for any information by clicking on it, instead of opening a new window
    or page, as in traditional systems, its content is opened in the very same
    place, keeping the ordering. In other words, the insertions appear all &ldquo;closed&rdquo;,
    keeping only the titles visible, and they can be opened by the visitor. It
    is a way to separate the content, but keep a defined organization and avoid
    rather long pages.</p>
  <p>There are three types of ordering for a search: by recommendations, by popularity,
    and by chronology. The standard ordering system first presents content that
    was tagged by the museum team through its CMS (represented by a star in the
    title). This function is usually used to call attention to a specific subject.
    The second option, frequently used in blogs, is to order all information
    chronologically. In a third option, when a user asks for order by popularity,
    the system provides a list ordered by the content that was more discussed,
    i.e., the ones with a greater number of comments. </p>
  <p>The information cataloguing is, however, not limited to the text. NanoWorld
    has a column where images and links related to nanoscience and nanotechnology
    can be found. As in the case of texts, the images and links can be indexed
    with pre-determined terms by the team responsible for the site; this facilitates
    and provides more resources for a specific search. </p>
  <p>As previously mentioned, the top of the page has a ludic functionality with
    a rather strong visual appeal. In NanoWorld we have developed a game that
    considers the scale of things and the necessary instrument to observe them,
    a central question in nanoscience and nanotechnology. </p>
  <h2>The Games </h2>
  <p>It is worth remembering that the Web site was conceived to reach several
    different types of visitors. One type is composed of young people who come
    either through their own curiosity or through proposed school projects and
    research. Games in the Web site can play a fundamental role for such a public:
    while having fun playing the games, young people start developing a new vocabulary
    and gain a sense of purpose for such advances in human knowledge. With these
    aims in mind, three games were produced:</p>
	<ul>
  <li> <strong>Nanomedicine </strong>(Figure
    3): a game about the application of nanotechnology in medicine. The users
    enter into a virtual environment where they can &ldquo;test&rdquo; the efficacy of medicaments
    inserted in nanostructures. The user is alerted that the game does not correspond
    to real situations, but links are offered to explanations about how the nanomedicaments
    act. In the game the users can experiment with different types of drugs for
    different types of diseases in cells. There are scores and levels to make
    the game more fun. </li>
	</ul>
  <p class="caption"><img src="knobel.fig3.jpg" alt="Fig 3: Screenshot of the Nanomedicine game. http://www.mc.unicamp.br/nanoaventura (under jogos - jogos on-line)" width="394" height="265" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 3: Screenshot of the Nanomedicine game.<br /> 
    <a
href="../http://www.mc.unicamp.br/nanoaventura" target="_blank">http://www.mc.unicamp.br/nanoaventura</a> (under
    jogos - jogos on-line)</p>
	<ul>
  <li> <strong>Nanocircuit </strong>(Figure
    4): a game about nanostructures.
    The users have to complete a circuit using nanotubes, buckyballs, and filaments
    of atoms. Here  users are introduced to the names of some nanostructures
    and the idea of combining them to form more complex structures. To make the
    game more interesting, there is a race against time while building the circuits.
    There are links in the game to explanations regarding the terms used. Contextualization
    is achieved by initiating the game in a situation where two scientists talk
    about using a piece of software to simulate the manipulation of nanostructures.
    Again there are different levels of difficulty and highest scores are computed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="caption"><img src="knobel.fig4.jpg" alt="Fig4: Screenshot of the Nanocircuit game. http://www.mc.unicamp.br/nanoaventura (under jogos - jogos on-line)" width="397" height="267" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig4: Screenshot of the Nanocircuit game.<br /> 
    <a
href="../http://www.mc.unicamp.br/nanoaventura" target="_blank">http://www.mc.unicamp.br/nanoaventura</a> (under
    jogos - jogos on-line)</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Game
      about visualization instruments and the corresponding scales</strong>:  in
      this game, players have to match the name of an image that is shown with
      its scale and the visualization instrument needed to see it. The score
      changes according to the number of correct answers and there are three
      levels of difficulty. After finishing, users get feedback about the correct
      and incorrect answers and add their names to see if they may be added to
      the &ldquo;highest scores hall&rdquo;. By playing this game, participants get used
      to the difference in scales and visualization instruments. The comparison
      among known images, scales and visualization of images in the scale of
      micrometers and nanometers helps in developing a sense of &ldquo;size&rdquo; and
      the instruments needed to measure it.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Expectations of the Game Creators</h3>
  <p>When creating such games, certain expectations were taken into account (Nunes &amp; Gaible,
    2002). The content specialists who are responsible for the site and who participated
    in the production process may want to add new images, update texts, consult
    scores and maybe eliminate items from it. All the games have an <em>administration</em> page,
    accessed through a usual browser, where it is possible to make changes without
    having to enter the Flash software used to develop the games. All the &ldquo;changeable&rdquo; parts
    of the games are saved in XML files that are accessed and changed through
    the administrative pages. The Flash games read such XML files in runtime. </p>
  <p>Another expectation was that these are classes of games that will possibly
    be reused in other games or even other Web sites. With this in mind, the
    construction process was modular: it is possible and easy to reuse the matching
    engine, the administration engines, the score engine, etc. Such engines could
    be considered cornerstones for the construction of more elaborate learning
    engines that allow the use of game-like simulations. This could alter the
    educational landscape (Foreman and Aldrich, 2005). </p>
  <p>The last important point to consider with respect to the games in the <em>NanoAventura</em> Web
    site is the possibility of reusing them as
    &ldquo;learning objects&rdquo;. That means they could possibly be reused as &ldquo;ready&rdquo;
    resources to be inserted in other Web sites or even in Learning Management
    Systems used for course administration. The rich and interactive simulations
    used for the games include communication to a background system for identification
    of users, and storage of states and scores. The construction of such games
    followed specifications that facilitate their reuse in other environments.
    Although some popular specifications for communications among learning objects
    and LMS exist, e.g. SCORM, there are limitations in using such specifications
    for game-like learning objects. For instance, in the case of the games presented
    here, just  plugging in and playing the learning object (the game) does
    not make it possible to access high scores without manual modifications in
    the databases &ndash; not the philosophy of the SCORM model. Another possibility,
    richer than this, is to pack the game as a content package that is used in
    IMS Learning Design course engines (Burgos et al, 2005). The advantage of
    doing this is that is possible to track how students used the game. By accessing
    and comparing their steps and scores, it is possible to create a discussion
    environment to complement and deepen the experience of using the game for
    educational purposes. The simulations were constructed with this frame in
    mind: exporting data about the use of the simulations may be useful someday. </p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>The extension of the museological experience of NanoAventura into the virtual
    environment presents the possibility of reaching new visitors from different
    places, not only leading to a diffusion of the exhibition, but also opening
    the ludic-learning experience. With the new version of the Web site already
    on-line, the challenge now is to convert it into a reference space on nanoscience
    and nanotechnology to permit coverage of the inherent interdisciplinarity
    of nanoscience and the huge amount of debate regarding these new technologies.
    The existence of a site with updated information in Portuguese is  a
    contribution to better communication of a scientific-technical area in development
    that, however, is still far from the everyday life for most of the population. </p>
