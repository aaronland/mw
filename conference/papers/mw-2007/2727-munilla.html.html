				<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
				<p class="abstract">This project is conceived as an interdisciplinary project,
				  to be developed in three years and involving different museums and heritage
				  institutions. Its framework goal is to extend the relationship between
				  industrial heritage, memory and ICTs, placing special emphasis on formal
				  and non-formal education, teaching and learning, and in particular the
				  potential of ICTs. Specifically, the project has as its main goals preserving
				  the industrial heritage of Catalonia; the use of industrial heritage as
				  a learning goal; and the development of virtual (on-line/on site) resources
				  for industrial heritage management, documentation and dissemination.</p>
				<p class="abstract">Complementary goals are to analyse virtual resources
				  and tools that can be used in transversal areas of knowledge like heritage;
				  and to investigate the design of learning activities that use these resources.
				  From this perspective, we consider it essential to conduct a theoretical
				  and methodological review of the current state of knowledge in this area,
				  and the development of case studies and specific products, including an
				  evaluation process.&nbsp; Taking as a base the different experiences carried
				  out in this area, we intend to confirm that the ICT resources in the Broadcasting
				  and Didactics of Heritage can become an essential factor for formal education.
				  Bearing in mind the above, this proposed project relates to the research,
				  analysis and design of tools channeled particularly to promote this new
				  interdisciplinary area of knowledge.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This project is in line with the research activity of the
    Museia Group (IN3/UOC) coordinated by Dr. Gloria Munilla and made up of an
    interdisciplinary team. Its objective is to become a space for research on
    Heritage, Museology and Museography that embraces different ambits of
    knowledge: museums, society, studies of publics, education, interpretation of
    heritage and evaluation; broadcasting and documentation of heritage; studies of
    museum publics and on-site and/or virtual exhibitions.</p>
  <p>Some of Museia's earlier research experiences focus on:
    evaluating the effectiveness of ICTs (nformation and communication
    technologies) in the broadcasting and documentation of heritage; the design and
    implementation of Web sites; their monitoring and evaluation (qualitative and
    quantitative); and the development of multi-media, hypertextual, on-line
    resources (teaching, learning, formal and non-formal education).</p>
  <p>In addition, projects developed around the different virtual
    exhibitions and thematic portals (<a href="../http://www.museia.cat/" target="_blank">http://www.museia.cat</a>) have permitted research
    focusing on the analysis of cybermuseum experiences through monitoring and
    evaluating their use and effectiveness; the definition of their appropriate
    methodology and criteria; analysis of the usage and resources of virtuality and
    its relationship with museography and heritage; methodologies for qualitative
    and quantitative evaluation as applied in this scientific field; the nucleation
    of an interdisciplinary evaluation team brought on by direct work with the
    Museum.</p>
  <p>Some of the conclusions of this preliminary research have
    already become standard references in national and international Heritage,
    Museology and ICT circles through presentations at congresses, publication of
    articles and books and participation in courses, lectures, etc. (cf. curricular
    documentation of participants in this proposed project, attached).</p>
  <p>The research process highlighted the relationship that must
    of necessity exist between ICTs and the field of studies of publics as applied
    to museums and heritage, and dealt specifically with issues like
    complementariness between on-site and/or virtual evaluation; behaviour of
    publics and different types of public; power of attraction and power of
    retention; aspects of communication, broadcasting and teaching; positioning;
    the need for an interdisciplinary evaluation team, etc. </p>
  <p>Museia is also working in the field of university teaching
    with contributions in the field of regulated training, postgraduate and
    doctoral training, as well as the changes and/or adaptations to come in with
    ESHA. Museia has set up alliances (also reflected in this proposed research
    project) with heritage and museums institutions such as the Directorate General
    for Heritage, Ministry of Culture of the Generalitat de Catalunya, the Institut
    de Cultura de Barcelona (Culture Institute of Barcelona) and several museums
    (MnACTEC, Museu Mar&iacute;tim, etc.); and other universities (UIB, UdeGi).</p>
  <p>Museia is currently working on the following projects:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Projects related to the Scientific Observatory of the
    Mediterranean City (ICUB/Generalitat) (Created and directed until 2004 by Dr.
    Carme Prats. Currently still under way). Based on the evaluation of ICTs as
    applied to museums and science centres.</li>
  
  <li>
    Museum/School and
    School/Museum, project run jointly with schools in Catalonia, and which gives
    specific priority to the relationship between formal and non-formal education,
    teaching and learning, with special emphasis on the potential of ICTs. </li>
  <li>
  Heritage, identity
  and cultural rights. Includes different subprojects such as the project on Cultural
  Identity, Heritage and Historical memory, which includes a full analysis of the
  potential of ICTs in this field; and the project related to the dissemination
  and documentation of heritage as a basic cultural right.</li>
  
<li>
  Heritage, Museums and
  ICTs in Catalonia. A project that nucleates into different subprojects and is
  based on the analysis of the potential of ICTs in the field of heritage and
  museums, and in the design and development of experiences in this field,
  jointly with different institutions that work in these fields, both in
  Catalonia and the rest of Spain. </li>
    </ol>
  <p>Of these projects, number 3 on Heritage, identity and
    cultural rights is the object of this presentation. However the current
    structure of the research group, with its interdisciplinary team, means we can
    develop the other projects to varying extents, since one of the basic
    objectives is that all 4 should give mutual feedback. For example, analysing
    the introduction of ICTs in Catalan museums and heritage institutions in a way
    complements the research approach that we wish to develop in this presentation:
    as we know, the issue of the introduction of and literacy in technology are the
    basis of the application and theoretical budgets of this or other research
    processes that have ICTs as a framework.</p>
  <p>As we have seen, among the basic objectives of the research
    group, within the framework of what is currently defined as the transversal
    field of knowledge of Heritage Interpretation, is to analyse the relationship
    between Cultural Identity, Heritage and Historical memory (Museia Annual
    Report: <a href="../http://www.museia.cat/" target="_blank">http://www.museia.cat</a>), including a full analysis of ICT's potential; and
    proposing and developing the project related to dissemination and documentation
    of heritage as a basic cultural right. In both senses, one of the most
    important thematic hubs is industrial Heritage, the object of analysis of this
    project. We refer specifically to the industrial heritage of Catalonia in which
    the most important institution involved with its conservation, recognised
    nationally and internationally, is the Science and Technological Museum of
    Catalonia - mNACTEC (<a href="../http://www.mnactec.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mnactec.com</a>) with which we are working directly on
    this proposal (with the expert guidance of Dr. Carme Prats, coordinator of the
    Territorial System of the mNACTEC, and member of the Museia research team) and
    other projects currently under way. Here, we should point out the development
    of joint projects focused on the production and use of resources that
    strengthen and revalue the natural and scientific heritage, as well as the
    analysis of the social perception of science and technology through heritage.
    Among other questions, this involves the approach to the communication and
    dissemination of knowledge processes and the analysis and study of publics (<a
href="../http://www.museia.cat/" target="_blank">http://www.museia.cat</a>;
  <a href="../http://www.mnactec.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mnactec.com</a>).</p>
  <p>The general aim of the mNACTEC is to foster knowledge of the
    history of science and technology and the industrialisation of Catalonia, and
    of the productive processes in society. To achieve this aim, the museum
    embraces the following specific objectives: to acquire, conserve and restore
    past and present-day scientific and technical property, both in movable
    heritage (objects, tools, machines) and built heritage (buildings,
    constructions); and to stimulate studies of the history of science, technology
    and industrialisation; to make known the technical and scientific knowledge and
    progress of present-day society; to become the centre of activities related to
    industrial heritage; and to offer a meeting place for society, industry, the
    scientific community and, in particular, universities. </p>
  <p>The geographical location, heritage, and landscape values of
    the museums in the mNACTEC System make them socio-cultural catalysers of their
    respective local areas. Also as members of a structured and organised network,
    they are centres of reference and tourist attractions for a large area. The
    development of content and proposals for scientific dissemination in attractive
    formats to stimulate curiosity and revalue knowledge amongst the general
    public, particularly young people, is a priority objective of the mNACTEC
    System. </p>
  <p>Amongst other options, the project so approached lets us
    work transversally in different areas of museology and heritage knowledge: the
    recovery of industrial heritage, specifically of Catalonia; the educational use
    of industrial heritage; and the development of virtual and digital resources
    (on-line/on site) to manage, document and make known industrial heritage.</p>
  <h2>The Recovery Of Catalan
    Industrial Heritage</h2>
  <p>The project has the general objectives of documenting and
    making known the industrial heritage of Catalonia, laying the foundations of
    what will become the Network of Scientific Museums of Catalonia, focusing its
    research on the analysis of material and immaterial heritage related to
    industrialisation. It also aims to establish and develop the relationship
    between heritage and space (industrial landscape, industrial ecology,
    industrial archaeology, etc.). Team researchers have extensive experience in
    the scientific-technical and industrial heritage fields, and have been or are
    linked to a greater or lesser extent to institutions of these characteristics.</p>
  <p>It is important to recall the links of Museia with the
    Scientific Observatory of the Mediterranean City (ICUB/Generalitat) and
    scientific production in this field (Gomis, R. M&ordf;. (2004)). </p>
  <h3>The Educational Use Of Industrial Heritage</h3>
  <p>Traditionally the relationship of museums with schools
    (primary, secondary and sixth-forms) has been fundamental in the science of
    Heritage, among other reasons to increase understanding of the exhibition
    discourse in heritage museums and/or institutions. This can be corroborated by
    a brief analysis of Spanish and international experiences over the last 10
    years, and the enhancement of the education, communication and dissemination
    services in these institutions. A more important issue, however, is how far
    educational institutions use and/or could use museum educational resources to
    complement formal education, introducing them into their curriculum. Here, the
    role that ICTs play and could play in this field is critical.</p>
  <p>These days, discussion of information and communication technologies
    (ICTs) and their relationship with the different fields of knowledge,
    particularly education and culture, is inevitable. For example, the concept of
    e-learning, or new ways of making known and interpreting heritage, only go to
    prove the basic relationships that can be established between:
    formal/non-formal education; on-siteness/virtuality; virtual museum/on-site
    museum; school/museum and museum/school; formal/non-formal education; etc. On
    studying different experiences developed in this field (Sub&iacute;as (2004); Sub&iacute;as,
    Munilla,  (2005); Corral (2006)), we find that ICT resources could become an
    indispensable factor in the Dissemination and Didactics of Heritage in formal
    education. In all these respects, the role of the Museu de la Ci&egrave;ncia i de la
    T&egrave;cnica de Catalunya has been and continues to be fundamental. See, among
    others, the project &lsquo;18 Museus per a les escoles. 18 Museus per con&egrave;ixer la
    industrialitzaci&oacute; i comprendre la ciencia i la t&egrave;cnica' (18 museums for
    schools. 18 museums for exploring industrialisation and understanding science
    and technology), in which the &lsquo;Sistema territorial del Museu de la Ci&egrave;ncia i de
    la T&egrave;cnica de Catalunya' (<a href="../http://www.mnactec.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mnactec.com</a>) is developed and
    enhanced (Spr&uuml;nker, J.; Munilla, G. (2007). </p>
  <h3>The Development Of Virtual
    And Digital Resources (On-Line/On Site) For The Management, Documentation And
    Dissemination Of Industrial Heritage.</h3>
  <p>From our research itinerary (already outlined above) and
    very particularly in the field of the relationship between heritage, museology
    and ICTs, we have established some basic aspects that are essential for dealing
    with this third area of knowledge:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Digital heritage as
    part of our heritage.</li>
  
<li>
  The relationship of
  museums with the Information Society (ICOM Barcelona 2001: domain
  &lt;museum&gt;).</li>
  
<li>
  Computers/the
  Internet in Catalonia, Spain and internationally; Culture/Museums/Heritage and
  the rest.</li>
  
<li>
  Training and
  specialisation in this area. </li>
  
<li>
  Recovery,
  conservation, documentation, didactics and dissemination. Work on the network.</li>
  
<li>
  Virtual resources and
  media dissemination. Dissemination and communication strategies. Positioning.</li>
  
<li>
  Different languages
  for dissemination.</li>
  
<li>
  Development of
  experiences for different types of public.</li>
  
<li>
  Museum/school
  activities.</li>
  
<li>
  Cybermuseography.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>We should mention some experiences that have already been
    developed dealing with the relationship between scientific and technical
    heritage and ICTs (Gomis (2004) and some of the current projects already
    indicated.</p>
  <h2>Objectives of the Project</h2>
  <p>Starting from the above, the project aims to follow a line
    of research, analysis and tool design that will particularly enhance this new
    interdisciplinary field of knowledge. </p>
  <p>Starting hypotheses are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Industrial heritage
    is an essential tool contributing to the recovery of historical memory.</li>
  
<li>
  Both on-site and
  virtual heritage communication and interpretation strategies are essential in
  the dissemination of industrial heritage.</li>
  
<li>
  ICTs foster access to
  documentation and dissemination of industrial heritage.</li>
  
<li>
  The use of ICTs in studying
  transverse fields of knowledge may encourage assimilation of content at
  primary, secondary and sixth-form levels.</li>
  
<li>
  The dissemination and
  teaching of collections can be encouraged through ICTs.</li>
  
<li>
  ICTs improve
  non-formal education in heritage institutions.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>From both perspectives, we believe that the interrelated and
    decisive research questions are: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    What is industrial
    heritage, and what direct and/or complementary relationship does it have with
    the concept and term &lsquo;historical memory'? </li>
  
<li>
  What do we understand
  by historical memory?</li>
  
<li>
  What are the elements
  that make up industrial heritage, and what type are they?</li>
  
<li>
  How can we show
  documentary heritage interactively on-line? Criteria for indexing.</li>
  
<li>
  What it is the best
  way to display oral heritage on-line? (Transcriptions, abstracts, video and
  audio recordings, etc.)</li>
  
<li>
  How can we establish
  a suitable methodology for evaluating virtual products?</li>
  
<li>
  What are the most
  effective learning activities (formal and/or non-formal) based on the use of
  ICTs for accessing knowledge of industrial heritage? </li>
  
<li>
  What form and content
  are presented? How are they organised?  </li>
  
<li>
  What is the behaviour
  of the school public (school students and teaching body) towards the different
  virtual resources (on-line/on site)? Strategies for analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Previous Cases Studies</h2>
  <p>Earlier projects that form our starting point, as
    experiences already carried out: </p>
  <p><strong>a) A research experience and some reflections on
    non-formal education in school curricula. </strong>Conducted by Carolina Sub&iacute;as
    under the supervision of Gloria Munilla, 2003-2004 (Munilla et al.. 2005).</p>
  <p>The school/museum and museum/school relationship is one of
    the clearest in dissemination policies by heritage and museum institutions, and
    already has a sound tradition (Alderoqui, 1996; Aguilera and Villalba, 1998; Hooper-Greenhill,
    1998; Hein, 1998; Fern&aacute;ndez Cervantes, 2001/2002). However, there have not been
    many experiences in the area of virtuality and of course this requires more
    specific monitoring. Currently, experiences relating museums with schools and
    virtual resources or spaces are becoming very interesting (Colorado (2003),
    Giordan et al. (1997), Errington et al. (2001), Bertuglia et al. (1999), Rico
    (2002), particularly p. 153-170 )on the potential of the Web. Another
    consideration is the significance in the most important international
    conferences on Heritage, Museums and ICTs allotted to pedagogical aspects of
    museums and ICTs: Culturtec 2002 (Madrid), EVA 2003 (Florence) and Museums and
    the Web 2003 (USA) (Ferreras, 2003).</p>
  <p>Apart from this, recent studies on the cultural consumption
    of young Catalans after the Enquesta de consum i pr&agrave;ctiques culturals de
    Catalunya, 2001 (Survey on cultural consumption and practices of Catalonia,
    2001) (Mart&iacute;nez  et al. (2004), only confirm the already well-established tradition
    of the relationship between memory institutions and young students. It is now
    received thinking to consider that there is a distancing in cultural
    consumption between young people and museums, felt to be distant from &lsquo;today's
    culture'.  But this distancing has been reduced by data now to hand: 48% of
    young people (say that they) have visited at least one museum a year, and
    almost 22% have visited more than twice. These data are almost 10 points above
    the average for the population at large. Among other issues, those responsible
    for the study consider that the inclusion of the school or university factor
    may also have a great bearing here.</p>
  <p>This work is a specific case study which has opened up many
    possibilities in formal/non-formal education and school/museum (or
    museum/school) relationships. It is therefore based on the experience of a
    specific project, in which pedagogical aspects have been among the basic
    factors of its conceptual structure. Currently, two of the virtual spaces
    designed have proved themselves to be ideal for carrying out joint activities
    with schools: &lsquo;Memorias de nuestra infancia: los ni&ntilde;os de la guerra (&lsquo;Memories
    of our childhood: the war children' <a href="../http://www.museia.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.museia.ca</a>t and the &lsquo;Portal de la Vall
    de Bo&iacute;' (Portal of the Vall de Bo&iacute; <a href="../http://www.museia.cat/" target="_blank">http://www.museia.cat</a>).</p>
  <p>This fact, as well as the specific purposes of the research
    project, including the wish to further explore the resources of non-formal
    education offered by museums and ICTs, led us to plan a series of on-site
    virtual activities with students at different levels of schooling. These were
    carried out between September and November 2003, and formed the End of Course
    Work in Humanities of Carolina Sub&iacute;as at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya
    between February 2003 and June 2004 (Sub&iacute;as, C. (2004 A and B)). The objective
    was to involve school students in carrying out specific activities related to
    some of the virtual exhibitions designed, particularly the exhibition &lsquo;Memorias
    de nuestra infancia: los ni&ntilde;os de la guerra' and &lsquo;Portal de la Vall de Bo&iacute;'.
    Activities were carried out in groups and brought together different students
    from each school. </p>
  <p>There has been a proposal to exhibit the activities carried
    out through a temporary on-site exhibition. This is because extensive and very
    diverse documentation was obtained: drawings, comments, compositions, works and
    essays on the Spanish Civil War, films, exchange of experiences between the
    young and older people who lived through this conflict, personal experiences of
    life and school in rural and urban environments, analysis of the introduction
    of ICTs into schools and their assimilation by child and youth publics. Also
    taken into account was feedback on the experience, raising among other
    possibilities subsequent evaluation of the experience by the specialist publics
    involved (teaching body, students, research team members, etc.). The evaluative
    process thus includes the basic parameters defined for a complete model of
    preliminary, educational and final evaluation, which is also what we are
    proposing here for cybermuseographic experiences (Hooper-Greenhill, 1998,
    99-116).</p>
  <p> Throughout the work, we have established levels of
    comparison between the fields of public and private school, different levels of
    the school public, and rural and urban areas. The schools involved were:
    several schools in the City of Barcelona (Pr&agrave;ctiques II, a public primary
    school; IES Emperador Carles, a public secondary and sixth-form school; IPSE, a
    private primary school); as well as Pont de Suert (IES Pont de Suert, a public
    secondary and sixth-form school) and Vall de Bo&iacute; (public primary schools). The
    experience thus constituted a detailed analysis of the potential of non-formal
    education with ICT support in the school field, and its relationship with the
    field of museums and heritage. Also essential for the development of this
    experience was the direct involvement of both teaching body and students.
    Another basic aspect was the definitive inclusion of an activity of this kind,
    based on virtual exhibitions, which permitted the production of a series of
    contents that have been recognised as free-choice credits by the management of
    the different centres.</p>
  <p>b) <strong>Diagnosis of the relationship between virtual
    museography teaching applications and formal education:</strong> case analyses, by
    Rosa Corral with the supervision of Laura Solanilla, 2005-2006 (Corral 2006).
    In this case, work was done on two levels. There is a theoretical analysis of
    the role played by new technologies in the museum in the educational field.
    Apart from this, a series of case studies proposed by heritage institutions was
    selected (The British Museum, Le Louvre, The Smithsonian, etc.) and their
    contributions and limitations in the field of formal education were analysed.</p>
  <p>c) <strong>Museu Nacional de la Ci&egrave;ncia i de la T&egrave;cnica de
    Catalunya (mNACTEC): several projects related to the documentation, didactics
    and dissemination of industrial heritage</strong>. Among these were &ldquo;18 museums for
    schools. Territorial system of Museu de la Ciencia i de la T&egrave;cnica de Catalunya.
    A national museum all over the country&rdquo; (<a href="../http://www.mnactec.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mnactec.com</a>)'. Currently, two
    projects are being put together and developed, with joint participation from
    museum researchers and researchers from the Museia research group:</p>
  <p>d) <strong>The social perception of science and technology
    through industrial and cultural heritage</strong>: an experimental study,
    coordinator: Dr. Carme Prats i Joaniquet (Deputy Director, mNACTEC): an
    evaluation programme for use with the general public and captive groups of
    schoolchildren, using audiovisual resources prepared ex professo for the
    project, based on the scientific and industrial heritage of the Sistema del
    Museu de la Ci&egrave;ncia i de la T&egrave;cnica de Catalunya (mNACTEC System), a network
    made up of 18 science and technology museums all over Catalonia. The general
    objective of this study is to add to the knowledge on social perceptions about
    science and technology in two environments: a physical visit to 4 centres in
    the mNACTEC System, and a virtual visit to the same heritage resources adapted
    to use of the Internet. The three specific objectives of the project are: </p>
  <ol>
  <li>
    to set up an
    interdisciplinary work team, including scientific, museological and
    communication specialists to prepare the experience's audiovisual resources,
    surveys and assessment system and conceptual discussion; </li>
  
<li>
  to create a product
  based on the scientific and technological heritage of the mNACTEC System in an
  attractive scientific disclosure format for exhibition in museums and on the
  Internet; and </li>
  
<li>
  to develop an
  innovative assessment system that can measure how far and in what specific
  aspects heritage resources influence the information, opinion, interest and
  scientific culture of people and communities. (Programa Nacional de Fomento de la
  Cultura Cient&iacute;fica Y Tecnol&oacute;gica Convocatoria de Ayudas 2006. (National

    </ol>
  <p>The Network of Scientific (science and technology) Museums
    of Catalonia, as its name indicates, aims to set up a virtual platform for
    management, documentation, didactics and dissemination in these institutions,
    based on the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) factor. In fact,
    the project which we are presenting means the start and development of the
    theoretical, methodological and applicable factors that will constitute the
    origin and implementation of this network. Coordinator: Dr. Carme Prats

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>The methodology to be implemented in this project is based
    on its organisation into the following objectives and phases:</p>
  <p>1) Analysing and drawing up the theoretical framework.</p>
  <p>2) Running case studies or pilot experiences in this field
    that involve the collection and analysis of data: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Recovery and
    documentation of industrial heritage elements (material heritage): the
    buildings.</li>
  
<li>
  Recovery and
  documentation of industrial heritage elements (oral heritage): people,
  historical memory.</li>
  
<li>
  Recovery and
  documentation of industrial heritage elements related to space and landscape:
  industrial landscape, industrial ecology.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>3)  Presenting industrial heritage items in the best form:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    The geographical
    factor: map of the industrial heritage of Catalonia.</li>
  
<li>
  The factor of didactics/access
  to industrial heritage by different types of public and at different levels of
  complexity.</li>
  
<li>
  The documentary and
  management factor: Network of museums of Science and Technology in Catalonia.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>4) Documenting the industrial heritage of Catalonia using
    different data types: images, documents, buildings, landscapes, interviews,
    testimony, etc. Develop the different resources for documentation and
    dissemination: on-line / on site; on-siteness, virtuality, etc.</p>
  <p>5) Evaluating and systematically monitoring pilot
    experiences carried out. The whole experience will be evaluated from the start
    of the project, allowing comprehensive monitoring of its implementation, taking
    into account similar prior experiences run by the research group. Overall, the
    evaluation process involves:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Monitoring of the
    virtual space and its use by different types of public and therefore analysis
    of access.</li>
  
<li>
  Evaluation by
  interviews, participant observation.</li>
  
<li>
  Quantitative and
  qualitative analysis.</li>
  
<li>
  Development of
  on-site and/or virtual activities with different types and groups of public.</li>
  
<li>
  Development and
  monitoring of strategies for positioning the virtual resources and/or spaces
  designed.</li>
  
<li>
  Analysis of the
  complementary or other nature of on-site and virtual projects. </li>
  
<li>
  Analysis and relationship
  between the on-site and virtual public or virtual communities developed in
  relation to the project, from a sociological and anthropological perspective.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>6) Drawing up the report of the whole project </p>
  <p>7) Applying results of the research in:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    museum spaces dealing
    with Catalan industrial heritage (the  mNACTEC territorial system).</li>
  
<li>
  improved learning
  processes within the framework of the curricular itineraries of students in
  primary, secondary and sixth-form education.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>8) Using the research project to open up extensive and
    recognised lines in this interdisciplinary field of knowledge between
    Industrial Heritage, Historical Memory, Documentation, Teaching and ICTs.</p>
  <p>9) Designing and carrying out a plan of action in the field
    of broadcasting, coverage and dissemination of the project's results. This
    broadcasting and dissemination plan is directly related to the plan proposed in
    the joint project on Percepci&oacute;n social de la ciencia y t&eacute;cnica mediante el
    patrimonio industrial i cultural: estudio experimental (Social perception of
    science and technology through industrial and cultural heritage: experimental
    study), coordinated by Dr. Carme Prats, already referred to.</p>
  <p>Finally, we propose the conceptualisation and development of
    a portal for the Industrial heritage and historical memory of Catalonia that
    deals with the subject from three viewpoints: </p>
  <p>1. Map of the Industrial Heritage of Catalonia. Topographic
    location, relationship with the landscape and documentation of each of the
    elements/buildings featured on this map</p>
  <p>2. Data base of documentary heritage related to Industrial
    heritage. To produce this, we will work from the collections of museums in the
    network, complementing them with collections from local archives and
    individuals: company store tokens, payroll sheets, photographs etc.</p>
  <p>3. Oral heritage project based on people who worked in the
    different industrial centres, documenting changes in the ways of life, culture
    and mindset. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of women in the
    industrialisation process, so incorporating a gender component</p>
  <p>Transversally, the portal will have a battery of on-line
    teaching resources, suitable for each educational level, which will allow us to
    use it as a teaching tool, so demonstrating the potential of new technologies in
    the educational field. </p>
  <h2>The Project </h2>
  <h3>1. Analysis, Review And
    Production Of The Theoretical Framework</h3>
  <h4>1.1. Plan of Work</h4>
  <p>The review and state-of-the-art focuses particularly on the
    last decade (1996/2006). As already explained, we must keep in mind that the
    project proposes a new look at the now classical relationship between
    industrial heritage, historical memory and teaching. Thus, from this
    perspective too, museum institutions have planned many related activities and
    much research within their educational and dissemination areas. The reverse
    relationship is less common, where ICTs and virtual resources are clearly basic
    for the approach to and exploration in these fields of knowledge. In fact, the
    precedents of our own research (in both Museia and the mNACTEC network) set the
    pace, and few similar works are known. It is above all in the English-speaking
    world where similar lines of work have been carried out, but overwhelmingly
    from the disciplinary focus of museology and heritage, as well as heritage institutions.

  <h4>1.2. Methodology: </h4>
  <p>The project is tackled from different perspectives:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Industrial heritage
    museums and institutions: teaching and education services, and activities
    specifically designed for different kinds of public.</li>
  
<li>
  Historic heritage,
  and its relationship with industrial heritage and historical memory.</li>
  
<li>
  The relationship of
  formal and non-formal education and its &lsquo;new' context, with an ICT focus.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>This is why in Phase One, the intervention of the whole (interdisciplinary) research team is
    essential. Each will contribute the perspective of their different fields of
    knowledge. The bibliographical and documentary review is important for the
    theoretical framework, as are the Spanish and international experiences of
    application over the last decade.</p>
  <h3>2. Development Of Case
    Studies And Pilot Experiences</h3>
  <h4><strong><em>2.1.
    Plan of Work</em></strong></h4>
  <br />
  <p>The plan of work also includes the objective of presenting the industrial
    heritage elements in the best way (Objective 3, explained above):</p>
  <p><strong>Phase One</strong>: Map of the Industrial heritage of
    Catalonia. Means the production of a museographic project and of what is known
    as an exhibition discourse, based on graphic, Web graphic, written, oral, etc.
    documentation. Involves the development of both on-site and virtual resources.
    In Phase One, work concentrates specifically on the following aspects: provision
    of content; exhibition design and discourse; graphics, communication and
    dissemination aspects; implementation and teaching and learning applications;
    and evaluation and study of the public.</p>
  <p><strong>Phase Two</strong>: structuring, design and implementation of
    spaces suitable for use as museums and interpretation centres in the mNACTEC
    Territorial System (Museu Nacional de la Ci&egrave;ncia i de la T&egrave;cnica de Catalunya),
    based on the network of science and technology museums of Catalonia.</p>
  <p><strong>Phase Three</strong>: design and development of a virtual
    space of the memory, focused on the field of modern and contemporary history
    and so also on industrial heritage. This aims to digitise and ensure access by
    the general public to the documentation and individual heritage deposited in
    collections and archives that in their current state have little chance of
    being consulted. In addition, this will be a virtual space specially designed
    for the educational community, developing specific programmes and proposals for
    work based on sound, visual, graphic and textual documentation contained in
    this resource. Also involves producing content and its systematic evaluation.</p>
  <h4> 2.2. Methodology</h4>
  <p>This is when the need for interdisciplinarity in the project
    can be most clearly seen. This involves aspects of design and conceptualisation
    of virtual resources (Cybermuseographics); assessment and supervision; analysis
    of data bases; design of educational activities within curricular itineraries;
    dissemination and communication of heritage; spaces for memory and interpretation
    and teaching about heritage. </p>
  <h3> 3. Documenting The Industrial Heritage Of Catalonia With
    Different Types Of Data</h3>
  <h4>3.1. Plan of Work: </h4>
  <p>Objective 4 involves the development of documentary activity
    almost from the start of the project and is thus parallel to Objective 1
    (theoretical framework) and Objective 2 (implementation, development,
    evaluation and dissemination of specific projects).</p>
  <h4><strong><em>3.2.
    Methodology</em></strong>: </h4>
  <p>Documenting the industrial heritage of Catalonia involves
    collation of different kinds of data: images, documents, buildings, landscapes,
    interviews, testimony, etc. Many of the techniques used for this collation and
    documentation come from historic, industrial archaeological and industrial
    ecological methodology, and the methodology applied in the transverse and 
    interdisciplinary field of knowledge that establishes the relationship between
    space and heritage.</p>
  <h3>4. Evaluating And Developing The Systematic Monitoring Of
    Pilot Experiences</h3>
  <h4><strong><em>4.1.
    Plan of work</em></strong>: </h4>
  <p>As with the former case, this objective involves development
    of activity from Phase Two of the project. </p>
  <h4>4.2. Methodology: </h4>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Monitoring of the
    virtual space and its use by different kinds of public and so analysis of
    access.</li>
  
<li>
  Evaluation by
  interviews, participant observation and other strategies.</li>
  
<li>
  Development of
  on-site and/or virtual activities with different kinds and groups of public.</li>
  
<li>
  Development and
  monitoring of strategies for positioning the virtual resources and/or spaces
  designed.</li>
  
<li>
  Analysis of the
  complementary or other nature of on-site and virtual projects. </li>
  
<li>
  Analysis and
  relationship between on-site and virtual publics or virtual communities
  developed in relation to the project, from sociological and anthropological
  perspectives.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>5. Drawing Up The Report Of The Whole Project</h3>
  <h4>5.1. Plan Of Work Envisaged:</h4>
  <p>Amongst other issues, the report will reflect the direct or
    indirect results of the project, as well as its timing, methodology and
    conclusions as regards the following fields of knowledge: analysis and
    evaluation, studies of publics, didactics and learning, exhibition discourse
    tools, museography, museology and heritage; industrial heritage: oral memory,
    material elements, etc. </p>
  <h4>5.2. Methodology:</h4>
  <p>All team members will be involved in preparing the report,
    each taking responsibility for one field of knowledge related to their own
    speciality. One of the main bases of the project is its evaluation and
    supervision with a view to obtaining feedback; results and data obtained must
    therefore be considered in the report. Both previously and in parallel, the research  
    team has already designed a communication and dissemination plan for its
    results (see below).</p>
  <h3>6. Applying Research Results </h3>
  <h4>6.1. Plan Of Work Envisaged:</h4>
  <p>In this section, it must be recalled that work begins from
    Phase One of the project, where the schools, teachers and students with whom we
    will agree to develop the pilot experiences will be directly involved. The
    schedule of involvement at different levels must therefore be designed jointly
    with these groups.</p>
  <h4>6.2. Methodology:</h4>
  <p>One of the keys to
    this entire research process is the development of methodologies and strategies
    that allow:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Access to industrial
    heritage by different kinds of public.</li>
  
<li>
  Access to industrial
  heritage at different levels of complexity.</li>
  
<li>
  Development of
  teaching and learning resources in relation to industrial heritage.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>The Research Project also intends these experiences to be
    considered as a framework for key content in school curricula. In this, as in
    the experiences already carried out, we rely on the complicity and cooperation
    of education professionals and students themselves.  </p>
  <p>Among the most interesting aspects of the project are
    aspects related to the analysis of experiences and their effectiveness for a
    particular type of public, the school public. In fact, this transverse approach
    is the subject of a specific transverse project which the research group has
    already begun to work on, under the title Tic, Educaci&oacute;n y Patrimonio (ICTs,
    Education and Heritage), and whose specific structure is given in the following
    diagram:</p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="fig1" id="Fig1"></a><a href="munilla.fig1.html"><img src="munilla.fig1.gif" alt="Fig 1: Project Scheme" width="400" height="259" border="0" /></a></p>
  <p class="caption" align="left">Fig 1: Project Scheme</p>
  <h3>7) Using The Research Project To Open Up Broad And
    Recognised Lines Of Research In This Interdisciplinary Field Of Knowledge.</h3>
  <p>The plan of work and methodology both run parallel to and
    follow the earlier phases. One of the project's objectives is that, when seen
    from the academic and university environment, these interdisciplinary fields of
    knowledge are recognised as amongst the basic channels for higher education. We
    therefore also try to design, for primary, secondary and sixth-form levels,
    credits that deal with these contents, like those we developed at the earlier
    stages of our research.</p>
  <p>This process will also be parallel to all actions for
    national and international dissemination planned by team members. </p>
  <h3>8) Designing And Carrying Out A Plan Of Action For
    Broadcasting And Dissemination Of The Project's Results </h3>
  <h4>8.1. Plan of Work: </h4>
  <p>It is intended to make a special effort to disseminate
    project results. This has two aims: </p>
  <ol>
  <li>
    To bring the most
    important results of our research to the general public. </li>
  
<li>
  To make known the
  results in Spanish and international scientific circles. To achieve this,
  absolutely all media available will be used: articles, monographs, conferences,
  attendance at lectures, reports, Web pages, etc. </li>
    </ol>
  <p>Finally, we envisage the creation of our own Web page. This
    page will also be conceptualised with two aims in mind: its access will be
    specially designed to bring the main results to the general public, and it will
    be a window open to the scientific world. The Web page will be regularly
    updated with results as we obtain them. In the last instance, the Museia Web
    page or portal has the overall objective of becoming a systematically updated
    virtual space about the fields of heritage, teaching, learning and virtual
    related resources.</p>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal">We expect this project to provide several scientific
    benefits. The most important scientific-and technical contributions that we
    hope to make at the end of the project are the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Establishment of an
    interdisciplinary framework for action among different fields of knowledge:
    Heritage, Memory and ICTs.</li>
  
<li>
  Analysis and
  development of a series of case studies that may open up a new line of action
  in this field.</li>
  
<li>
  Acknowledging new
  channels of interpretation of the relationship between formal and non-formal
  education.</li>
  
<li>
  Developing virtual
  spaces that will involve the provision and digitisation of large amounts of
  written, sound and visual documentary collections; both on-line and off- line
  resources.</li>
  
<li>
  Developing a series
  of transverse subjects/credits (focusing on the imminent European convergence
  in higher education) in the field of degrees, postgraduate qualifications and
  doctorates, within the framework of the areas of knowledge of heritage,
  culture, ICTs and education (also the Humanities).</li>
  
<li>
  Establishing a Web
  page that will serve to make known this continuously accumulating data both to
  the scientific world and to the international scientific community.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>As regards the plan for dissemination, we
    expect to obtain and create a great many articles, monographs, attendances at
    lectures, conferences, exhibitions, etc. which will help us continue to feed
    the appropriate channels with the continuous accumulation of information as our
    research team proceeds. We intend to attend the most important international
    conferences and symposiums in this field. Communications will also be presented
    to all Spanish conferences and symposiums on themes or from sectors that focus
    on any of the issues possibly related to our subject of study. We intend to
    publish in reputable Spanish publications at least five articles a year of a
    global and generic nature on the progress of our research. We will also write
    an indeterminate number of articles on the more specific themes of our research.
    Lastly, going back to the Web page, we intend to have it up and running around
    the end of the first year, and this will allow us the continuous and updated
    dissemination of results. We intend to organise international study days at the
    end of the entire project to present its overall results. In addition, we are
    hoping to organise at least one specific workshop each year of the project.</p>
  <p>The project that we have presented and detailed above is a
    proposal that contributes an up-to-date and interdisciplinary vision of the
    relationship between heritage, formal/non-formal education and ICTs. We
    therefore envisage from the start that the benefits from our activity will be
    very diverse. We also feel that although the desired results of and main reason
    for our activity are scientific, we also wish to achieve maximum dissemination
    of our research among the general public. </p>
