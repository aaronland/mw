			      <h3 class="URL">&nbsp;Abstract</h3>
			      <p class="AbstractText">The
				      phrase <strong>Web 2.0</strong>,
				      now so well-known as to be generally considered mainstream, has taken
				      hold on-line, first as a catch phrase and now as a way of life to many
				      of the bigger, content rich providers. No longer are users content
				      to just consume content; instead they want to take part in it, to personalise,
				      it and to share experiences with others. In the museum sector, however,
				      uptake has typically been low. Some notable exceptions exist, of course,
				      but key questions remains. Why has deployment of this &ldquo;new&rdquo; approach
				      to content been slow? What barriers exist in museums? How can we go
				      about addressing these? </p>
				  <p class="AbstractText">This
				      paper attempts first to identify why Web 2.0 is of particular importance
				      to our sector; next, to examine common barriers in our particular context;
				      and finally, to find ways practitioners might go about addressing these
				      barriers in their organisations.</p>

				  <h1>Web
				    2.0 and Why Museums Should Care</h1>
				  <p>Web 2.0 is often
				      lauded, sometimes derided and almost always subjected to scrutiny.
				      What exactly does this phrase mean? Does it mean anything, or nothing?
				      Has Web 2.0 been and gone, already bloomed, or is it about to be the
				      next big thing, a fad? Is it finally the Berners-Lee vision of the &ldquo;Read-Write
				      Web&rdquo;? Or is it just about technology, and not, actually, about
				      content? Aren&rsquo;t we better off waiting for Web 3? And last, but
				      not least, as people who produce Web content, should we actually care?</p>
				  <p>The fact that Web 2.0 is a catchphrase, a meaningless
				    marketing slogan to some, is immaterial here. What the phrase has done,
				    usefully, is to draw a dotted line around a series of aspects of Web
				    experience. The finer points about the extent of Web 2-ness are also
				    unimportant &ndash; to some, Web 2.0 may encompass any kind of Web site
				    which has the means for users to <em>author the experience</em> in
				    some way; to others, it may be about an &lsquo;AJAX-ified&rsquo; user
				    interface.</p>
				  <p>Trawling the Web finds the following phrases recurring
				    around Web 2.0: &ldquo;mashup&rdquo;, &ldquo;de-centralisation&rdquo;, &ldquo;non-Web
				    like&rdquo;, &ldquo;user generated content&rdquo;, &ldquo;permission
				    based activity&rdquo;, &ldquo;collaboration&rdquo;, &ldquo;Creative Commons&rdquo; &hellip; What
				    sits at the heart of all of these, and one of the reasons Web 2.0 has
				    been difficult for bigger, established organisations (including museums)
				    to embrace, is that almost all the things talked about put <strong>users</strong> and
				    not <strong>the organisation </strong>at
				    the centre of the equation. Organisational structures, departmental ways
				    of naming things, the perceived &lsquo;value&rsquo; of our assets, in
				    fact, <em>what the organisation has to say about itself - all </em>are
				    being challenged. </p>
				  <p>These are difficult things to question, particularly
				    in an organisation which is historically highly respected or has a long-standing
				    way of doing things. Web 2.0 does uncomfortable things: it releases assets
				    into the wild, it empowers users to speak their minds, it asks people
				    to share and collaborate in unprecedented ways. For museums, the challenges
				    are profound. What about dumbing down? Who is going to moderate? What
				    if they don&rsquo;t <strong>like</strong> our
				    exhibition? Surely our curators are the experts, not some random bloke
				    who rode one of those bikes when he was a kid&hellip;?</p>
				  <p>Questions like this often form the basis of the barriers
				    to &lsquo;doing&rsquo; Web 2.0. Later on, we&rsquo;ll examine these barriers
				    in detail and try to find some strategies for addressing them.</p>
				  <p>As mainstream writers start to bring <strong>YouTube</strong> and <strong>MySpace</strong> into
				      the public eye, there is also of course a major risk. It is no different
				      from the risk with other new technologies, particularly those that
				      are climbing the <em>Gartner Hype Curve</em>. The risk is that
				      we do these things just because we can, or because everyone else is
				      doing them, or even more dangerously, because it attracts funding. </p>
				  <p>These are not good reasons for &lsquo;doing&rsquo; Web
				    2.0. </p>
				  <p>There are, however, many synergies between some of
				    the key tenets of Web 2.0 and what Museums are trying to do, both in-gallery
				    and on-line. For years, we have tried as a sector to appeal to mass market,
				    to solicit opinions about our objects, to not just be a repository of
				    dusty stuff in cases. At the centre of Web 2.0 is the promise of richer,
				    more relevant, more personal content: content which can make a difference
				    to users &ndash; ultimately, content which goes at least some distance
				    to answering these challenges. This is a Web where the reactive consumers
				    become public producers. Experiences are shared and opinions given.</p>

				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      1: Modified from &ldquo;Hobby Princess&rdquo; (<a href="../http://tinyurl.com/pmf38" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/pmf38</a>)</p>
				  <p>In this light, Web 2.0 brings some very interesting
				    things to the party, especially in our particular environment.</p>
				  <p>Doing Web 2.0 just because we can is wrong. However,
				    doing it because our users expect it, because it adds real value to what
				    we &ndash; and they - have to say, or because it extends the content
				    experience in real and meaningful ways, is, of course, right.</p>
				  <h2>We Should Care Because&hellip;It&rsquo;s the Way the Web is Going</h2>
				  <h3>User Generated Content (UGC)</h3>
				  <p>Users are no longer content to just surf. Media consumers
				    are instead becoming <strong>prosumers</strong> &ndash; spending
				    time either producing content themselves or reading content produced
				    by other users. Although current thinking has percentages of content
				    producers&nbsp; far eclipsed by content consumers, as the tools become
				    available and confidence grows, people will produce more and more. At
				    the same time, the means by which value is atttibuted to this content
				    will become better defined.</p>
				  <p>Museum Web sites should not be exceptions to this
				    groundswell of UGC. Of course, there are still many places where museum
				    Web site content (like any Web site content) should just be published,
				    and where UGC is irrelevant. Opening times and location maps don&rsquo;t
				    typically need comments, opinions or other external input. Museological
				    content, however &ndash; objects, stories, games &ndash; are often ripe
				    for UGC. What better way to make that object relevant to today&rsquo;s
				    users than by offering the opportunity to write about it, comment about
				    it, compare it with what is in their lives now?</p>
				  <h3>Opinions&hellip;</h3>
				  <p>Opinions count, and although authority is important
				    (more on this later), real people are attracted by real people&rsquo;s
				    opinions. Sites like eBay are examples of user-generated content at its
				    most lucrative. eBay would not exist without the core understanding of
				    trust and what it means. This trust is built by and between users; eBay
				    provides a <em>mechanism</em> for expressing
				    this trust, but it has absolutely nothing to do with authoring or moderating
				    this trust. At a secondary level is, of course, trust of the eBay brand,
				    or trust of their e-commerce mechanism, but the means by which users
				    rate each other is absolutely fundamental to the operation of the site.<strong></strong></p>
				  <p>Countless examples exist of the amplifying power of
				    the Web for user opinion: from RatherGate (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rathergate)
				    to iPod Nano Screens (<a href="../http://www.flawedmusicplayer.com/" target="_blank">www.flawedmusicplayer.com</a> &ndash; no
				    longer live, following requests from Apple: see http://www.google.com/search?q=flawedmusicplayer).
				    Real people are changing the real world through the Web. </p>
				  <h3>Syndication &ndash; We&rsquo;re Already Doing It, But May Not Realise &hellip;</h3>
				  <p>Mashups, feed sharing, APIs &ndash; these are still
				    on the edge of the curve, only really understood and used by early adopters.
				    RSS is one area where syndication is starting to become main-stream,
				    but what is slightly less well understood is that almost every Web site
				    is essentially already a source of syndicated content. Many people browse
				    your content without even visiting your Web site. </p>
				  <p>Take Google Images. Here is a tool which sets out
				    specifically to side-step on-site search engines and to provide
				    a much more powerful <em>user-focused</em> interface.
				    Why search one (museum) site for information on George Stephenson when
				    you can search the entire Web? Once images have been found in this way,
				    people are increasingly then embedding them in their blogs and MySpace pages.
				    Around 9% of
				    referring traffic to the Science Museum Web site is from
				    MySpace with people &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; images in this way. And quite possibly,
				    none of these people have ever actually been to
				    the Science Museum Web site!</p>
				  <p>Sites like ClipMarks (http://<a href="../http://www.clipmarks.com/" target="_blank">www.clipmarks.com</a>/)
				      or Google Notebook (http://<a href="../http://www.google.com/notebook" target="_blank">www.google.com/notebook</a>/)
				      let users &lsquo;clip&rsquo; (essentially, copy and paste) content
				      from any site &ndash; again, the consumers of this content probably
				      never even get as far as your site, let alone the homepage or some
				      means of contextualising what they&rsquo;ve just read. These sites,
				      and RSS, are popular because people are busy &ndash; often far too
				      busy to want to dig deep into pages of description. </p>
				  <p>Later on, we will describe why this is an important
				    point, particularly when trying to justify the production of feeds and
				    APIs, as well as when supporting more open content sharing standards.</p>
				  <p>Museums are perfect examples of the &lsquo;long tail&rsquo; &ndash; our
				    popular content is probably eclipsed in overall popularity by the weirdnesses
				    lurking at the end of the tail: the artefacts and stories which make
				    our curators and our organisations real and interesting to users. Google
				    isn&rsquo;t great in many ways at helping long tail content (by its nature
				    it promotes pages which are &lsquo;popular&rsquo; - i.e. by definition,
				    not at the thinner end of the tail), but it does get people to content
				    on sites they probably wouldn&rsquo;t normally visit. People increasingly
				    use Google to find stuff (surprise!) &ndash; but it is easily forgotten
				    that they may well not have set out to look at your museum Web site,
				    but instead were just searching for a biography of Charles Babbage or
				    an image for their homework essay.</p>
				  <h3>User Experience</h3>
				  <p>For some people, Web 2.0 seemed as well to define
				    a whole new look and feel. For a while, it seemed as if the entire world
				    had reflected logos, beta signs and the letter &ldquo;r&rdquo; suffixed
				    at the end of the name (Flickr, Mappr&hellip;Objectr, anybody?). Any
				    serious examination of what Web 2.0 means should ignore the more fickle
				    aspects of this, but there are some interesting points which this &lsquo;new&rsquo; way
				    of working uncovers.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="ellis_m-fig-2.gif" alt="Fig 2: From the Web 2.0 Logo Generator" width="252" height="90" /></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      2: From the Web 2.0 Logo Generator (<a href="../http://h-master.net/web2.0/" target="_blank">http://h-master.net/web2.0/</a>)</p>
				  <p>Probably most interesting here is that technologies
				    such as AJAX can be used to change the users&rsquo; relationships with
				    the on-line environment. The &lsquo;rich user experience&rsquo; as explained
				    by the original O&rsquo;Reilly &lsquo;meme map&rsquo; (O&rsquo;Reilly,
				    2005) covers not only the ways in which users are empowered to engage
				    with content, but also the <strong>environment</strong> in
				    which they engage. AJAX, as one example, provides new paradigms in Web
				    browsing where drag and drop shopping baskets can co-exist with accessibility,
				    where external content can be fed seamlessly on to the page, or where
				    a pop-up window can work (elegantly!) to display large versions of images.
				    In short, an environment can now be created where users&rsquo; experiences
				    are much closer to using a desktop program. </p>
				  <h1>The Barriers&hellip;</h1>
				  <p>Like any change, &lsquo;Web 2-ness&rsquo; can be a
				    source of fear. New technologies &ndash; in particular those that impact
				    on core aspects of what an organisation is and does - are particularly
				    subject to reservations from all levels of an organisation. From the
				    fears that a Web developer might have over learning a new technology,
				    to clashes at management level over ownership, to director-level fears
				    about the public and sponsor perceptions of an organisation, Web 2.0
				    is a difficult beast to tame. </p>
				  <h3>&ldquo;Simply, Why Should We Bother?&rdquo;</h3>
				  <p>Challenging the status quo of an activity which is
				    already well established (or not, in some cases!) is always difficult.
				    Hearing about major Web 2.0 companies in the popular media as they continue
				    to thrive certainly helps the drive to adopt these technologies, provided
				    expectation can be managed, of course. </p>
				  <p>Often, though, finding justification to &lsquo;do&rsquo; Web
				    2.0 is a challenge in itself. Measurement of success is ill-defined (see &ldquo;Measuring
				    It&rdquo;, below); and the actual tangible benefit is hard to define. &lsquo;Content
				    ROI&rsquo;, as in the Web many of us worked in 5-8 years ago, is very
				    hard to pin down.</p>
				  <h3>Cultural and Political: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s My Content&hellip;&rdquo;</h3>
				  <p>Cultural and political barriers are often the most
				    challenging to respond to, because they require a hard-to-define &ldquo;soft&rdquo; approach
				    which is not about proving new technologies, but is instead about working
				    with people who feel challenged by these. Often, the Web function is
				    situated in an already debated position within an organisation. Marketing,
				    IT and education departments often lay claim to the Web, with &lsquo;matrix
				    managed&rsquo; lines between them: Web teams are often scattered among
				    these teams, not firmly embedded into any one. </p>
				  <p>Throwing contestable technologies into this mix can
				    prove extremely challenging, especially when these technologies go against
				    much of what has gone before. Education and Marketing functions often
				    have trouble with the UGC elements of Web 2.0; both find the concept
				    of an external party editing content on the site difficult from both
				    a brand and a &lsquo;trusted organisation&rsquo; perspective. Curatorial
				    staff have additional, deep seated concerns about authority once user
				    content is brought into the mix. </p>
				  <h3>Technical</h3>
				  <p>Over in IT, the questions are often instead about
				    security, denial of service attacks, or how to manage accessibility or
				    metrics within these new frameworks of content delivery. </p>
				  <p>As well as these concerns, members of the IT community
				    may well also focus on issues such as interoperability; import and export
				    of data; management of users&rsquo; ids; and the scalability and the
				    reliability of a service. This becomes particularly relevant when external
				    services are also a part of the delivery framework: depending on one&rsquo;s
				    own IT infrastructure is one thing; depending on a (sometimes unknown)
				    third party is something else altogether.</p>
				  <p>There may also be understandable concerns regarding
				    the levels of technical expertise&nbsp; required in order to develop
				    innovative services.</p>
				  <h3>Resource and Cost</h3>
				  <p>Resource concerns are common: surely the organisation
				    requires additional money, time or expertise to invest in the deployment
				    of new services? There is a perception that all UGC requires intensive
				    moderation, or that any new technology is, by its definition, expensive
				    and difficult to implement. In the early stages of implementation of
				    technologies, figures and comparisons are hard to come by &ndash; case
				    studies often only exist in the form of privately funded start-ups whose
				    writers are often loath to produce details on implementation.</p>
				  <h3>Content: Legality, Privacy, Liability</h3>
				  <p>Data protection, privacy, liability and accessibility
				    issues, uncertainties regarding the lack of any formal contractual agreements
				    - are often fears which surround Web 2.0. This may also give rise to
				    concerns regarding the sustainability of such services, and disaster
				    recovery strategies which may be needed if an external provider of a
				    service becomes bankrupt or changes the terms and conditions governing
				    use of the service to the detriment of the user organisation. </p>
				  <p>At the same time, commercial arms of organisations
				    - who obviously guard their content jealously and often charge for access
				    - are of course nervous when a new approach is suggested and appears
				    to give away that content for free, or apparently dilutes the value of
				    that content by allowing users to edit. </p>
				  <p>Liability and the legality of who is responsible for
				    content is also an area of much confusion. Negotiating terms with users
				    and funders is often key to this, and this negotiation is frequently
				    done by those outside the group driving for Web 2.0. Internal relationship
				    building is vital, and where disparate groups are negotiating for different
				    things, major setbacks can easily occur.</p>
				  <h3>Measuring It</h3>
				  <p>Even basic Web metrics are often difficult to pin
				    down: already, defining terms such as &lsquo;visits&rsquo; to internal
				    groups, let alone government or sponsors, is very often hard to do. </p>
				  <p>Throwing Web 2.0 into the mix confuses things much
				    further. Not only are there ill-defined ways of measuring success, technically,
				    but alsoagreed standards are often non-existent. Couple this with the
				    fact that technologies such as AJAX actually <strong>change</strong> the
				    way that people interact with a page (and hence change visit analysis),
				    and things become much more complex: an AJAX style approach to pages
				    means that the relationship between page views, visits and hits are skewed
				    in as-yet unknown ways. A third layer of confusion is added when you
				    consider off-site content. How do you measure syndicated content: either
				    RSS feeds or borrowed resources such as images or clips? And if you could
				    find a way of measuring them, technically, how can you then measure their
				    effectiveness? Do they count as &lsquo;your&rsquo; content? And what
				    if your content is mashed up with someone else&rsquo;s?</p>
				  <h1>Some Answers&hellip;</h1>
				  <h3>Simply, Why Should We Bother...</h3>
				  <p>Museums <strong>must</strong> continue
				      to pioneer on the Web. We have extraordinary content: niche, long tail
				      content as well as high-profile &lsquo;exhibition friendly&rsquo; content.
				      We also have people who are among the best in the world and certainly
				      the most knowledgeable about their fields.</p>
				  <p>The opportunities we have as a sector for touching
				    real people with what we do are immense. To do this we need to find technologies
				    which bridge the gap between &lsquo;us&rsquo; and &lsquo;them&rsquo;.</p>
				  <p>Obviously, the environment needs first and foremost
				    to be <em>right</em> for Web
				    2.0: it needs to fit the organisation, the process and the
				    particular application. But, provided this is the case, examples from
				    the bigger players (YouTube, MySpace, Google, Yahoo, Flickr) can demonstrate
				    the immense power, and profitability, of user generated content, the
				    mashup environment and ways of distributed working. Real-world examples
				    are starting to emerge of how UGC can boost Web site traffic and profits.
				    Museums are also bringing specific examples into the arena
				    of how to use these tools effectively in our sector.</p>
				  <p>Provided expectation can be managed, one of the strongest
				    things about Web 2.0 is its media visibility. Unlike server-side technologies,
				    or &ldquo;deep tech&rdquo; such as hardware, Web 2.0 is now talked about,
				    debated, and endlessly cited in the public media. Museums can look to
				    this publicity and use it to their own advantage. Having said already
				    that &ldquo;doing Web 2.0&rdquo; just for the funding is wrong, it is
				    also accurate to highlight that funding <em>follows
				    significant social movement</em>: money is usually
				    available for technologies that pioneer new ways of engaging users. </p>
				  <h3>Cultural and Political: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s My Content&hellip;&rdquo;</h3>
				  <p>Ownership of Web sites, content, and user-facing resources
				    has always been a challenge and it is unlikely that this is going to
				    change in the short term. On the one hand, Web 2.0 approaches can be
				    considered difficult in these environments: conversely it can also be
				    demonstrated that UGC and associated Web 2.0 technologies can bring real
				    benefits to educational audiences and also provide a powerful marketing
				    tool. Increasingly as museums and other respected organisations such
				    as the BBC produce this kind of content and begin to embrace what it
				    means, case studies are becoming available which prove that users feel
				    empowered and engaged by these new content approaches.</p>
				  <p>Often concerns about how UGC may damage a brand or
				    the authority of that brand can be alleviated very simply by good graphic
				    and interface design: for example, users understand now that certain
				    reviews on Amazon are from the publisher whilst others are from other
				    users. There is no confusion here about &ldquo;authority&rdquo;. We can
				    afford to mix and match our curatorial &ldquo;expert&rdquo; content with
				    those who have different sets of experiences.</p>
				  <h3><strong>Technical</strong> </h3>
				  <p>Technical concerns are often difficult to un-pick,
				    but in many scenarios the core technical and IT teams are often the first
				    users (the &ldquo;Early Adopters&rdquo; &ndash; see below) of these kinds
				    of technology. As such, these teams are incredibly useful sources of
				    information when looking for innovative solutions to Web 2.0 issues. </p>
				  <p>There are understandable concerns with distributed
				    computing, but often technologies exist which can be brought to bear
				    on these issues. The &ldquo;API approach&rdquo; &ndash; where systems
				    provide data via web services or other network connectivity is <strong>the</strong> way
				    ahead for web development, and few deny this common-sense approach. Museums
				    should look to apply pressure to software suppliers to provide well-documented
				    APIs, and even embargo those who don&rsquo;t have this functionality
				    on their development roadmaps. </p>
				  <h3><strong>Resource, Cost and Content Legality</strong> </h3>
				  <p>One of the most interesting things about Web 2.0 is
				    that it does not call for a sea-change: small-scale solutions can, and
				    should, be rolled out very easily. Benefits can be measured and fed back
				    quickly, and used as input into a virtuous cycle of support for these
				    technologies. This is Rapid Application Design (RAD) for the Web: build
				    it, test it, amend it, then rinse and repeat&hellip;</p>
				  <p>From a human resource perspective, User Generated
				    Content is usually not the scary &ldquo;all we&rsquo;ll end up doing
				    is editing endless obscene comments 24/7&rdquo; beast that it first appears.
				    The key here is to provide user-facing platforms which <strong>encourage</strong> users
				    to get involved but at the same time have a certain level <strong>barrier
				    to entry</strong> to discourage spam.
				    The classic example is asking users to provide a valid email address.
				    Not only does this kind of approach discourage bots, but it also means
				    that the user is probably serious about writing some content for your
				    site. Users who genuinely want to take part will cross these barriers.
				    Those who are simply looking to abuse your institution probably won&rsquo;t. </p>
				  <p>Other strategies can always be brought to bear, and
				    often answer legal concerns. The BBC, for example, has a &ldquo;tell
				    us and we&rsquo;ll remove it within X hours&rdquo; disclaimer on the
				    UGC. External moderation companies such as eModeration (<a href="../http://www.emoderation.com/" target="_blank">http://www.emoderation.com</a>)
				    can be employed purely to moderate content. Part-moderation
				    (pre- and post-moderation) or asking end-users themselves
				    to moderate content have also been employed successfully
				    on many sites. As more institutions, including museums, start
				    to work with these kinds of techniques, the legal boundaries
				    will become clearer and better defined. </p>
				  <h3><strong>Measuring It</strong> </h3>
				  <p>Our sector could, and should, play a leading role
				    in helping define what Web 2.0 metrics look like. By engaging
				    with government and other funding bodies early, we could
				    begin to shape some of the emerging standards. Sites like
				    Feed Burner (<a href="../http://www.feedburner.com/" target="_blank">http://www.feedburner.com</a>)
				    already provide (free) tools for measuring RSS usage. As
				    a sector, we should start to report on these usage figures
				    for our own feeds and begin defining what we think success
				    looks like for these different ways of producing and consuming
				    content. <strong></strong></p>
				  <h1>More Answers: Shaping the Curve</h1>
				  <p>The Gartner hype curve, a modified version of which
				    is shown in Figure 3, provides a useful mechanism for understanding how
				    new technologies may be perceived. This can help us to develop generic
				    strategies which are appropriate at particular points on the curve when
				    dealing with <strong>any</strong> new
				    technology.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="ellis_m-fig-3.gif" alt="Fig 3: Gartner Hype Curve (modified)" width="400" height="277" /></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      3: Gartner Hype Curve (modified)</p>
				  <p><em>Early adopters</em> are
				      little or no challenge. These are the people who are technically savvy;
				      those who &lsquo;get it&rsquo; and are prepared to make do with (in
				      fact, relish) beta versions which are often buggy, incomplete, or inadequate
				      in other ways. As the technology becomes more widespread, often with
				      increased media coverage, it moves up the curve, before peaking at
				      a point called the <em>Peak of Inflated Expectations</em>.
				      Here, media hype has expanded and extended the original reach of the
				      technology to realms often way beyond those which are actually possible.
				      Typically here we see the technology presented as somehow being the
				      panacea to everything; funding is widely available; and, to quote a
				      well-known blog, &ldquo;&hellip;your mum has one in her living room&rdquo;. </p>
				  <p>At around this time, or earlier, voices of dissent
				    begin to be heard, typically in the non-mainstream media, blogosphere
				    or technical community. The technology isn&rsquo;t as good as the hype,
				    the screen tends to break&hellip;the battery life is short&hellip;the
				    wheels fall off&hellip;Shortly afterwards the technology begins an inevitable
				    descent into the trough of despair &ndash; before
				    leveling out sometime later with the service plateau. </p>
				  <p>The growth and burst of the &lsquo;first Internet
				    bubble&rsquo; is a typical example of Gartner hype, albeit one with a
				    quite unprecedented and widespread impact.</p>
				  <p>The technology chasm which
				      is indicated on the graph is a critical time for any new technology.
				      Given the widespread understanding of how hype ebbs and flows, it is
				      often during the rising phase that technology is at the highest risk
				      of failing to gain a foothold in the mainstream. During this time,
				      the challenges to organisations (as outlined above) are at their most
				      acute.</p>
				  <p>In order to prevent failure of potentially useful
				    technologies to bridge this chasm and also to reduce the time it takes
				    for useful technologies to move from use by early adopters to more widespread
				    usage, there is a need to adopt an appropriate set of strategies. There
				    is also a need to manage expectations so that organisations do not have
				    unrealistic expectations as to the capabilities of a particular technology
				    or the difficulties which may be experienced in achieving such expectations.
				    Similarly, there is a need to minimise the 'trough of despair' and to
				    ease the transition to a stable service plateau &ndash; until, of course,
				    the next disruptive technology arrives.</p>
				  <h3>Avoiding the Chasm</h3>
				  <p>The following approaches may help to shape the Gartner
				    hype in a Web 2.0 environment:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong>Advocacy: </strong>It
				        is not always true to say that IT innovation should be deployed in
				        response to clearly articulated user requirements. The take-up of
				        the Web in the early to mid 1990s was due to the potential which
				        organisations identified once that had seen the Web and identified
				        its potential to support current business requirements and also to
				        provide new services which hadn't been considered previously.</li>
				    <li><strong>Listening to and addressing concerns</strong>:
				        The advocacy of the potential benefits should be followed up by a
				        period of listening to concerns and addressing issues which may be
				        raised. There need not, however, be a clearly identified solution
				        to all of the concerns. Solutions may emerge as more experience is
				        gained. Alternatively, it may be that concerns are not as significant
				        as initially thought.</li>
				    <li><strong>Supporting enthusiasts</strong>:
				        It will probably be naive to expect everyone to be willing to accept
				        a major new technological development. Rather than waiting to gain
				        general acceptance, an alternative approach may be to support those
				        who are enthusiastic and who may still have concerns but would be
				        willing to experiment.</li>
				    <li><strong>Refining approaches</strong>:
				        It is important to ensure that the experiences (positive and negative)
				        gained by the initial adopters are noted and refinements to a final
				        service deployment are developed.</li>
				    <li><strong>Conducting risk assessments</strong>:
				        It is a mistake to expect innovation to be completely risk free.
				        Rather, any potential risks should be identified and assessed. Balance
				        the risks of deploying an innovative service and the risks of doing
				        nothing. The latter, for example, could be that one's competitors
				        take the risks, resulting in the marginalising of your organization.</li>
				    <li><strong>Managing expectations</strong>:
				        The need to promote potential benefits in order to overcome inertia
				        needs to be balanced against the need to avoid overselling the benefits
				        of a technology or the effort needed to ensure that the technology
				        can be used in a sustainable fashion.<strong> </strong> </li>
				    <li><strong>Sharing experiences and expertise</strong>:
				        Conferences and events (such as the <em>Museums and the Web</em> and
				        the <em>Museums and the Web UK</em> conferences),
				        mailing lists (such as the MCG JISCMail list) and resources such
				        as the QA Focus briefing documents (<a href="../http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/qa-focus/documents/briefings/" target="_blank">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/qa-focus/documents/briefings/</a>)
				        can help developers in learning about innovations and sharing implementation
				        experiences.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <h3>Avoiding the Trough</h3>
				  <p>Once technologies become over-hyped there is a danger
				    that disillusionment will set in when the technologies fail to live up
				    to expectations. The 'trough of despair' can be avoided by </p>
				  <ul>
				    <li><strong>Low risk and low cost solutions</strong>.
				        In a Web 2.0 environment in particular,&nbsp; there may be low risk
				        solutions which can be deployed for little cost. Hosted services
				        such as Blogger provide resilient, flexible, and, most important,
				        free means to build Web 2.0 platforms.</li>
				    <li><strong>Flexible business cases</strong>.
				        At these early stages it can be useful to examine existing business
				        models and reflect on the opportunities which new technologies may
				        provide. For example, providing RSS feeds about the museum can allow
				        third party aggregators to expose this information to their user
				        community. This may result in visits to your physical museum from
				        groups who might otherwise have proved difficult to reach.</li>
				    <li><strong>Quality assurance</strong>.
				        There will be a need to develop and deploy quality assurance procedures
				        which document both policies for the service and systematic procedures
				        to ensure that the policies are being correctly implemented.</li>
				    <li><strong>Managed transition into a service environment</strong>.
				        The enthusiasm of&nbsp;&nbsp; innovators and early adopters is not
				        likely to be sustainable when the innovation is deployed in a service
				        environment. There will be a need to manage this transitional stage.</li>
				    <li><strong>Migration.</strong> The
				        planning stage for the deployment of a new service should also be
				        the time when plans are made for the migration of the service to
				        a new environment. This should include the export of data held in
				        the system and testing processes for importing the data into alternative
				        services.</li>
				    <li><strong>Risk management</strong>:
				        migration of data is one aspect of a risk management strategy. A
				        risk management strategy should also include aspects such as planning
				        for server unavailability, performance problems, etc. </li>
				    <li><strong>Openness and Transparency</strong>.
				        A simple technique for minimising possible risks associated with
				        innovation is to be open with one&rsquo;s user community. If a new
				        service is being trialed, inform the users of this, and be honest
				        about possible dangers. You may find that they appreciate being informed
				        and involved in the experimentation.</li>
				    <li><strong>Professional development</strong>.
				        Ensure that those who are involved in the development work have suitable
				        training. Also ensure that other members of the organisation have
				        a better understanding of how Web 2.0 is being used and how possible
				        risks are being managed.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <h1>Conclusions</h1>
				  <p>This paper has argued that the museum community needs
				    to continue to strengthen its understanding of the Web 2.0 phenomenon.
				    Although &lsquo;doing Web 2.0&rsquo; just for the sake of it is a danger,
				    the opportunities which Web 2.0 presents are incredibly exciting, particularly
				    given the content museums have and the audiences we seek to engage.</p>
				  <p>It is only by working with these technologies &lsquo;in
				    the wild&rsquo; that we begin to understand exactly what the benefits
				    and risks of these approaches are. This paper has identified some of
				    the more common barriers for not engaging with these new approaches and
				    suggests strategies for overcoming these barriers. Continued peer dialogue
				    is the strongest means of building engaging and relevant Web 2.0 experiences
				    within the museum sector. </p>
