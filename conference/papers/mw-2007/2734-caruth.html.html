				<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
				<p class="abstractText">The
				      mission of the Brooklyn Museum is to act as a bridge between the rich
				      artistic heritage of world cultures, as embodied in its collections,
				      and the unique experience of each visitor. Dedicated to the primacy
				      of the visitor experience, committed to excellence in every aspect
				      of its collections and programs, and drawing on both new and traditional
				      tools of communication, interpretation, and presentation, the Museum
				      aims to serve its diverse public as a dynamic, innovative, and welcoming
				      center for learning through the visual arts.</p>
				  <p class="keywords">Keywords:
				      Web 2.0, community, Brooklyn, Graffiti, flickr, MySpace,
				    interpretive materials</p>
				  <p>The mission of the Brooklyn Museum carries forth from
				    our Director, Arnold Lehman, to our exhibitions, programs, and services,
				    and through our Web site. Conscious of our community-oriented mission
				    and the diversity of our audience, as well as that of the greater metropolitan
				    area, in 2006 we set out to further engage our current on-line audiences
				    and simultaneously build an interactive Web community. The Interpretive
				    Materials Manager and the Manager of Information Systems have worked
				    together closely to utilize Web 2.0 sites and services not only to reach
				    out to our young audience demographic, but also to provide interactive
				    learning tools and relevant forms of interpretation. Our efforts have
				    for the most part been successful, despite a very modest budget. This
				    paper discusses the challenges, successes, and lessons of our various
				    Web 2.0 projects in 2006-7, involving but not limited to Blogger, Flickr,
				    MySpace, Facebook, Blip.tv, YouTube, Cell Phone Audio Tours, and podcasts/mp3
				    downloads. </p>
				  <p>As one example, we will review lessons learned from
				    the Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s summer exhibition, <em>Graffiti</em>,
				    on view June 30&ndash;September 6, 2006.&nbsp; <em>Graffiti</em> utilized
				    sites such as Flickr and MySpace to highlight the exhibition itself as
				    well as its in-gallery and on-line interactive&nbsp; projects (see &ldquo;Multimedia
				    Highlights&rdquo; at <a href="../http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/graffiti/">www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/graffiti/</a> for
				    examples).</p>
				  <h1>Building
				      an On-line Community at the Brooklyn Museum: A Timeline</h1>
				  <p>In 2006, the Manager of Information Systems and the
				    Interpretive Materials Manager somewhat inadvertently began to align
				    what had been detached efforts in order to create a more dynamic Web
				    site, provide interactive exhibition experiences on-line, and extend
				    the Museum visit. The narrative that follows discusses the various pilot
				    projects, from spring 2006 to the present, in which we employed Web 2.0
				    to support the Museum&rsquo;s community-oriented and visitor-friendly
				    mission, fostering the general public&rsquo;s interaction and dialogue
				    with the institution. Of course we recognize the many public and scholarly
				    conversations currently taking place about on-line communities, the commercialization
				    of the Web, and the &ldquo;I&rdquo;/&rdquo;U&rdquo; phenomenon of the
				    Internet generation, characterized by the rise of the Internet, rapid
				    communication, and informality, both in and out of a museum context.
				    But our narrative does not address them directly. Instead, we present
				    our work as it unfolded - organically, seasonally, and sometimes improvisationally.
				    We hope that this chronological &lsquo;timeline&rsquo; presentation will
				    encourage other institutions in similar situations and/or with similar
				    goals to look at their exhibition schedules and find an occasion to begin
				    participating in these community-generated arenas. &ldquo;The era of
				    control is over: You can either stay in the bunker, or you can try to
				    participate. And to not participate is criminal&rdquo; (Dilworth 2006).In
				    the beginning, we faced a number of challenges and concerns.</p>
				  <h2>Challenges</h2>
				  <p><strong>Museum mission:</strong> Though
				      the Museum&rsquo;s community-based mission had somewhat different ramifications
				      for our distinct institutional roles, essentially both of us faced
				      the same question. How do we translate that mission&nbsp; to our Web
				      site and make it relevant and exciting for our audiences?</p>
				  <p><strong>Audience:</strong> A
				      series of visitor surveys from 2002 on had revealed that the majority
				      of our audience were young (55% under the age 45), highly educated
				      (72% had undergraduate degrees or higher), and computer-savvy (8 out
				      of 10 had access to the Internet).&nbsp; The same surveys indicated
				      that these younger visitors consumed content faster - that is, they
				      visited more exhibitions in a shorter period of time - yet wanted to
				      get more out of their visits.</p>
				  <p><strong>Web Migration:</strong> In
				      early spring 2006, the Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s Web site was going through
				      a complicated four-month technical migration; this meant freezing all
				      new development until that transition was complete. This circumstance
				      limited what we were able to accomplish for our immediate exhibitions.</p>
				  <p><strong>Limited Staff:</strong>&nbsp; During
				      this period, there was not enough Information Systems programming staff
				      to keep up with institutional demands and other apparent needs. At
				      the same time, the Museum had (and has) only one Interpretive Materials
				      person, carrying responsibility for both in-gallery and on-line interpretive
				      projects.</p>
				  <p><strong>Funding:</strong>&nbsp; Limited
				      funding to develop programming and/or increase the staff was an issue
				      for us, as it is for many museums.</p>
				  <p><strong>Staff Education: </strong>The
				      Museum&rsquo;s Director, Arnold Lehman, was very supportive of our
				      efforts and recognized how Web 2.0 initiatives advanced the Museum&rsquo;s
				      mission. Still, it was necessary<strong> </strong>to<strong> </strong>educate
				      a number of others on staff about these platforms and how they could
				      be used effectively and efficiently.&nbsp; </p>
				  <p><strong>Limited Communication:</strong> We
				      are two people within a staff of 350 and reside in two different wings,
				      and two different departments, of the Museum. As a result, contact
				      between us was at first minimal and our efforts not always unified.</p>
				  <h2>Progress</h2>
				  <p>Despite these issues, things began to come together:
				    at the same time that our Web site was migrating and the Information
				    Systems Manager (Shelley) was thinking about ways to make a more dynamic
				    and interactive Web site, the Interpretive Materials Manager (Nicole)
				    was considering new ways not only to keep a digital record of our gallery
				    interactives, but also to make them accessible and relevant to our audiences
				    on-line (whether as their sole form of visitation or as an extension
				    of their physical visits to the Museum). </p>
				  <p>Then, with the IS department&rsquo;s discovery of
				    Blip.tv and Flickr and a growing sense of IM&rsquo;s objectives, we recognized
				    that our goals were actually parallel: we realized that Web 2.0 communities
				    allowed us to provide interesting content and interpretation on-line
				    - letting us operate within the constraints just mentioned while nonetheless
				    reaching for the institution&rsquo;s overarching goals. </p>
				  <h1>Waking
				      Up with Wegman: Spring 2006</h1>
				  <p>Our first foray into the Web 2.0 world occurred during
				    our exhibition<em> William Wegman: Funney/Strange</em> (March
				    10-May 28, 2006). With the artist&rsquo;s fabulous video titled <em>Museum</em> on
				    view in our lobby, we wanted to find a way to provide that content for
				    our audience on-line. Why? It was the basic impulse of wanting to share
				    - the impetus that drives most Web 2.0 sites. With no way to program
				    video into our Web site at the time, we found that with an upload to
				    Blip.tv and a simple link, we could indeed provide the content quickly
				    and easily. With Blip.tv&rsquo;s ability to track views and their comment-posting
				    feature, we could immediately see that video was fairly popular on the
				    site and that our visitors wanted to express themselves about it. </p>
				  <p><strong>Audience</strong>:
				      Suddenly, we had two audiences: first, our regular visitors; and, second,
				      a substantial new audience from Blip.tv, made up of people viewing
				      our content on-line even though they might never have come to our homepage
				      otherwise.</p>
				  <p><strong>Community </strong>happened
				      instantly, and<strong> </strong>our
				      visitors were giving us direct feedback on the video by posting comments.<strong></strong></p>
				  <p><strong>Simplicity: </strong>Keeping
				      things simple (an upload plus a link) made our work - and visitor navigation
				      - quick and easy.</p>

				      1: William Wegman Cell Phone Audio Tour page.&nbsp; <a href="../http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/william_wegman/william_wegman_audio_tour.php">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/william_wegman
				      /william_wegman_audio_tour.php</a></p>
				  <p>The Interpretive Materials package for the Wegman
				    exhibition included our pilot cell phone audio tour in which visitors
				    could hear William Wegman and/or a Brooklyn Museum curator talk about
				    a selection of works on view. <strong>Guide BY Cell</strong>,
				    a San Francisco-based company, was offering a free 30-day trial, and
				    so we developed this audio component to run for the last four weeks of
				    the exhibition. The cell phone tour came at a time when the IM Manager
				    was reevaluating the institution&rsquo;s more traditional audio tours
				    and researching the new options that the market had to offer. In that
				    research, the cellular phone seemed to be the one device that significantly
				    reduced (though perhaps did not completely eliminate) the generational
				    divide, as cell ownership ran the gamut from pre-teens to older adults.
				    In our pilot program, we discovered that the pickup rate for the cell
				    phone tour tripled from our usual audio tour numbers. We will return
				    to this subject later in our narrative, to discuss the subsequent integration
				    of cell phone tours into our Web site and Web 2.0 ventures. This integration
				    could not be completely foreseen at the time of the Wegman show. </p>
				  <h1>Growing
				      with GRAFFITI: Summer 2006</h1>
				  <p>Struck by the positive visitor and staff response
				    to the Wegman video and cell phone audio pilot, we began to evaluate
				    various Web 2.0 sites to see how they could help us create more interactive
				    exhibition content, within our limitations. </p>

				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      4: The Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s &ldquo;Graffiti Mural&rdquo; following
				      weeks of visitor participation </p>
				  <p>The Interpretive Materials plan for <em>Graffiti</em> invited
				      museum-goers to &lsquo;tag&rsquo; two designated walls within the exhibition
				      space. This wall was<em> <u>the</u></em> tipping
				      point for our collaboration, going forward, and the catalyst for building
				      a dynamic interactive Web site.&nbsp; For, anticipating that this wall
				      would change significantly during the exhibition&rsquo;s eight-week
				      run, the IM manager planned to take the activity one step further -
				      inviting visitors to track the progress of the &ldquo;Museum Mural&rdquo; on
				      our Web site. Again, the idea was at hand before we knew quite how
				      to bring it to fruition. At the suggestion of members of the IS department,
				      we employed the popular photo-sharing site Flickr, and for $24 a year
				      (the cost of a Flickr pro account), we could upload new digital images,
				      weekly, taken off the wall. Through the use of Flickr, we realized
				      that we could provide this content/activity quickly and efficiently,
				      and without the arduous in-house development of our own program. Caruth/Bernstein_Link: http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/sets/72157594171809720/</p>
				  <h2>The &ldquo;Graffiti
				      in Brooklyn&rdquo; Archive</h2>
				  <p class="caption"><a href="caruth_Fig5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="caruth_Fig5.jpg" alt="Fig 5" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">&nbsp;Fig
				      5: A public work by the Brooklyn-based street artist Elbow-Toe</p>
				  <p>Now that we had our Flickr account, we started to
				    think about other ways it could be leveraged. We decided to create another
				    project in which we asked visitors to submit images of already-existing
				    street art from their local Brooklyn neighborhoods. Photos e-mailed to
				    the Museum were posted to our Flickr account throughout the run of the
				    exhibition. In the end, the community established the first-ever Museum
				    archive of local street artists. Caruth/Bernstein_Link: <a href="../http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/sets/72157594168613271/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/sets/72157594168613271/</a></p>
				  <h2>Virtual
				      Graffiti</h2>
			      
				  <p class="caption"><a href="caruth_Fig6.png" target="_blank"><img src="caruth_Fig6.png" alt="Fig 6" width="400" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">&nbsp;Fig

				      drawing_tool_template/drawing_gallery.php</a></p>
				  <p>Having a plan for in-gallery tagging, we started to
				    ask ourselves if we could provide a way for Web visitors to do the same
				    thing - create a graffiti drawing, but virtually, via the Web. We soon
				    remembered that there was an on-line drawing tool as part of the Museum&rsquo;s
				    award-winning teen site <em>From Street to Studio</em>,
				    created for the exhibition <em>Basquiat</em> the
				    previous year. In order to add this to our multimedia package, we hired
				    the original development team of the <em>Basquiat</em> site
				    (EduWeb) to repurpose the same tool in a generic form.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><a href="caruth_Fig7.png" target="_blank"><img src="caruth_Fig7.png" alt="Fig 7" width="400" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">&nbsp;Fig
				      7: Screenshot of the Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s on-line drawing tool.</p>
				  <p>With this drawing tool, visitors to the <em>Graffiti</em> exhibition
				      page were able to create on-line work using a virtual spray can, marker,
				      pencil, or pen and submit it to an on-line gallery for others to see.
				      The re-engineering of the drawing tool cost a fraction of what new
				      development would have, and now that this tool has been generalized,
				      we can use it over and over again for any suitable exhibition.&nbsp; Advancing
				      the idea of Museum accessibility, the drawing tool provided a way for
				      visitors to make their mark even if they couldn&rsquo;t come to the
				      Museum in person. Many submissions came in, both from local Brooklynites
				      and a range of international contributors.</p>
				  <h2>Podcasting </h2>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="caruth_Fig8.png" alt="Fig 8" width="400" /></p>
				  <p class="caption">&nbsp;Fig
				      8: The Brooklyn Museum Web Page for Graffiti related
				      podcasts. <a href="../http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/graffiti/podcast.php">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/graffiti/podcast.php</a></p>
				  <p>With the digital equipment that we had purchased to
				    record William Wegman for the cell phone audio tour, we partnered with
				    the Museum&rsquo;s Adult Programs office to record exhibiting artists
				    and local street artists, live, as they led tours through the exhibition
				    during our popular <em>Target First Saturday</em> events.
				    (<em>First Saturday</em> is
				    a series of Museum programs taking place on the first Saturday of every
				    month; it includes artist talks, films, dance lessons, live bands or
				    DJs, and more, ending with a two-hour dance party.) These recordings
				    launched the Museum&rsquo;s podcast series. Because the recordings were
				    live, we felt that these podcasts spoke to the spirit of spontaneity
				    which underlies our working style, and which is also seen on a <em>First
				    Saturday,</em> where recent attendance
				    has averaged 20,000 people<strong>.</strong></p>
				  <h2>MySpace </h2>
				  <p>In addition to promoting the <em>Graffiti</em> exhibition
				      on our own Web site, we got the word out through our MySpace page.
				      Interestingly, one of the local street artists, Ellis G., who was recorded
				      for our podcast series, had a popular MySpace presence. With Ellis&rsquo;s
				      help on MySpace, the Museum was able to gain good word-of-mouth about
				      the show and publicize the gallery talks and podcast series. Along
				      the way, Ellis helped the Museum make many MySpace friends. <strong></strong></p>
				  <h2>At
				      the close of GRAFFITI:</h2>
				  <p>There
				      were 35,314 photo-set views (The &lsquo;Museum Mural&rsquo; was viewed
				      12,488 times;&nbsp; <em>Graffiti in Brooklyn</em> was
				      viewed 12,376)</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>913
				      photographs were submitted to the <em>Graffiti in Brooklyn</em> archive </li>
				    <li>1,338
				      virtual drawings were submitted </li>
				    <li>There
				      were 1,000 downloads of our three cumulative podcasts</li>
				    <li>The
				      Museum&rsquo;s MySpace page had over 3,000 friends.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>The plan was a success in terms of sheer numbers,
				    and an even bigger success in terms of mission.&nbsp; We had discovered
				    that community on the Web didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean programming on
				    our own site. On the contrary, seeking out our audience in their own
				    Web communities (Flickr, MySpace, Blip.tv,) was even more powerful.&nbsp; After
				    all, why should we expect them to come to us?  </p>
				  <h1>Flowing
				      into Fall 2006</h1>
				  <p>After <em>Graffiti</em>,
				      we continued to fine-tune our Web 2.0 profiles, exploring how we could
				      utilize them with each new exhibition and give our visitors various
				      methods of interpretation for each.</p>

				      staff to install the exhibition Ron
				      Mueck on view
				      at the Brooklyn Museum, November 3, 2006&ndash;February 4, 2007. http://<a href="../http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/ron_mueck/">www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/ron_mueck/</a></p>
				  <p>The interpretation of scale is fundamental to Ron
				    Mueck&rsquo;s sculpture, and therefore it is essential to give the visitor
				    a direct experience of the actual work on view. By creating a Flickr
				    slideshow that took our visitors behind the scenes of installing the
				    exhibition, we were better able to translate the sense of the works&rsquo; scale,
				    capturing images of art handlers, the artist, and his assistant moving
				    around his larger-than-life <em>Girl</em> and
				    much smaller <em>Spooning Couple.</em></p>
				  <p>As with William Wegman, this exhibition included a
				    wonderful video about the artist&rsquo;s process (courtesy of the National
				    Gallery, London). We hosted a short clip of this significant resource
				    on our Web site, and then uploaded the full 30-minute video to Blip.tv,
				    where it has been viewed more than 8,000 times.</p>

				  <p>For the Mueck exhibition, we developed an on-line
				    Q&amp;A with the artist, a new multimedia highlight. For this we only
				    needed to set up an e-mail address to which visitors could submit questions
				    for the artist. After the submission deadline, all comments were gathered
				    and e-mailed to the artist for response. </p>

				  <p>A podcast was created for <em>Tigers of Wrath</em>,
				      but with a slightly different interpretive purpose from the others.
				      Made directly with the artist, the podcast was more than a cool highlight
				      or nice addition: it was essential, since the installation called for
				      minimal interpretation in the conventional form of printed didactic
				      materials.</p>
				  <h1>Bringing
				      Community Home: Winter/Spring 2007</h1>
				  <p class="caption"><a href="caruth_Fig15.png" target="_blank"><img src="caruth_Fig15.png" alt="Fig 15" width="400" border="0" /></a></p>
				  <p class="caption">&nbsp;Fig
				      15: Brooklyn Museum Community home page. http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/</p>
				  <p>By this point, we had not only received the continued
				    support of the Museum Director, but had also garnered interest from curators,
				    educators, and others on staff about future possibilities, and had extended
				    that excitement to the Board of Trustees. As a result, we now felt that
				    was time to bring community home. Having now developed a backbone of
				    various Web 2.0 ventures, we gathered and combined them into one area
				    on the Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s Web site and called it &lsquo;<strong>Community.&rsquo;</strong> The
				    move allowed for more visible Web participation and permitted the unification
				    of our two on-line audiences: the Web 2.0 communities and our general
				    Brooklyn Museum Web site visitors.</p>
				  <p>In addition to this special area, we are working to
				    integrate community features more directly into all areas of the Web
				    site.&nbsp; For example, when putting the Museum&rsquo;s collection of
				    Brooklyn Bridge-related materials on-line, we also created a community
				    area in which visitors can share their own photos and artworks of our
				    community&rsquo;s iconic bridge.&nbsp; By providing e-mail addresses
				    for feedback when we produce such Web projects, we are able to communicate
				    with our visitors directly. Our commitment to community on the Web site
				    will continue to evolve with each new exhibition and as we keep abreast
				    of new developments in Web 2.0.</p>

				  <p>To take community one step further, we will deploy
				    cell phone audio tours at the Museum in March 2007. These tours enable
				    us to integrate some of our Web efforts into the physical exhibition
				    and gallery experience by assigning a simple number code to related podcasts
				    in our ever-growing series. Our podcasts therefore become accessible
				    to anyone who has a cell phone (a more widespread device than the iPod
				    or other mp3 player), and visitors won&rsquo;t have to remember to download
				    at home prior to their visits. We also attach importance to the &lsquo;community-friendliness&rsquo; of
				    this device and system which extends our ability to gather feedback from
				    visitors; they are encouraged to key in #1 and record their comments
				    about an exhibition, an object, and/or the general audio tour itself.
				    These recordings can then be selectively transferred to the tour, in
				    this way making the community voice part of everyone&rsquo;s experience
				    and interpretation - a myriad of voices. With the recent release of the
				    iPhone and similar technologies, the future of cell phones as part and
				    parcel of Web 2.0 technology appears assured. </p>
				  <h1>Conclusion:
				      Our Advice and What We&rsquo;ve Learned</h1>
				  <ul>
				    <li>Commit
				      and respond.&nbsp; Remember, these are communities, and to be a good
				      community member, you need to participate.&nbsp; That means reading
				      comments, posting responses, joining groups, and providing
				      a steady stream of fresh content.</li>
				    <li>Know
				      your audience. Google yourself and find out what people
				      are saying about your institution and its Web presence. Create surveys,
				      if you can. Even the quick and dirty can be extremely useful.</li>
				    <li>Pilot
				      and evaluate. It&rsquo;s a good idea to pilot and then evaluate before
				      making any large up-front investments or commitments. The formative
				      stage is the time when you can begin to gauge what &lsquo;community&rsquo; really
				      means for your institution. </li>
				    <li>Success
				      is determined by audience participation. If your audience
				      is participating, your success can be measured in word-of-mouth.</li>
				    <li>Community
				      first and foremost, marketing second.&nbsp; If you make a commitment
				      to the community and provide worthwhile content, marketing
				      will follow naturally. If you are there just to advertise, you are
				      not being a good community member.</li>
				    <li>Interpretive
				      materials on the Web further the goals of both the exhibition
				      and the institution and are as valuable as any wall label or text panel.</li>
				    <li>To
				      build an on-line community, you really can start small.
				      Flickr is free, if you don't do a lot of uploading (a pro account is
				      just $24 a year). MySpace, YouTube, Facebook, and so on are all free,
				      too.&nbsp;Yes,
				      you need a camera, but doesn&rsquo;t almost everybody have one? </li>
				    <li>The
				      community&rsquo;s voice can be louder than the museum&rsquo;s, and
				      that can be a good thing. Be prepared for both the good comments and
				      the bad, and be open to constructive criticism.&nbsp; Listen to your
				      audience. It&rsquo;s worth the effort - and the comments (good or bad)
				      are more valuable than you could ever imagine.</li>
