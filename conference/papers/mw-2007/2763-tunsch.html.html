				<p class="abstract">The importance of Wikipedia for the documentation and
				  promotion of museum holdings is gaining acceptance, and the number of references
				  to articles is growing. However, the museum world still pays little attention
				  to the Wikipedia project as a collaborative community with&nbsp;
				  intentions, structures, and special features. Although these
				  observations are based on museums in Germany and focus on the German Wikipedia,
				  they are just as important and applicable to other museums and other editions
				  of Wikipedia. Universities and libraries have already taken advantage of
				  the Wikipedia and have established functional links.</p>
				<p class="abstract">In that the mission of museums is closely related to

				  is worthy of consideration. This paper provides the complete study to serve

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>In order to define the possible advantages of utilization
    and cooperation, both the museum world and the Wikipedia world can be considered
    communities dedicated to the expansion of knowledge. This knowledge is targeted
    at the large and not very specific audience that we commonly call
    &ldquo;the general public.&rdquo; Museums collect objects, provide documentation and
    produce knowledge about those objects and the representing fields of sciences
    or other scholarship. Wikipedia collects data and information pieces, provides
    articles, and at the same time offers insight into the process of how knowledge
    grows. Along these similarities, the Wikipedia shall be examined in the following
    areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> methods
      (discussion, conventions, manuals, standards)</li>
    <li> practical
      experience (interaction, stable knowledge/process)</li>
    <li> content
      (metadata, SWD, PND, templates, structure, quality management, languages)</li>
    <li> contributors
      (scholars and other museum staff, visitors, students)</li>
	  </ul>
  <p>This consideration will provide information to discuss
    the following questions in the Professional Forum:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Which
      parts of the DIKW chain (data, information, knowledge, wisdom) provide the
      most efficient connections between museums and the Wikipedia?</li>
    <li> Where
      are the easiest access points for scholars, and how can connections be built?</li>
    <li> Which
      museum activities can be seen as related to Wikipedia with mutual benefits
      for both communities, and how can scholars be part of these activities? In
      this context, consideration will be given to museum documentation, research,
      public access to information in the museum, publications, and educational
      material.</li>
   <li> What
     are possible tools that would enable the use of Wikipedia, and which tools
     are missing?</li>
  </ul>
  <p> The
      results of reflections and discussions can outline the map of interconnections
      between these two communities and thus provide orientation for scholars,
      museum activities, and projects.</p>
  <h2>Museum and Wikipedia</h2>
  <p class="BlockQuote">It&rsquo;s a museum, what&rsquo;s to know? You bang in a nail, you
    hang up a picture. Any idiot could do that.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Sophia Petrillo [The Golden Girls, 2007; episode
    34, 2<sup>nd</sup> season, episode 9: &ldquo;Joust
    [sic] between Friends&rdquo;]) </p>
  <p>Isn&rsquo;t that a quite charming definition of a museum? So
    we have a view on museums from outside, how about Wikipedia?</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">&ldquo;Wikipedia generates noise, not knowledge. Previous encyclopedias
    were well-researched and contained precise information that could be trusted
    to be correct. Wikipedia, on the other hand, contains a large amount of errors,
    omissions and superfluous trivia&rdquo; (Prillinger, 2004).</p>
  <p>According to his Web site, Prillinger (2006) holds master&rsquo;s
    and doctoral degrees in philosophy, is a librarian, editor-in-chief of a
    library Web site (Vienna University Library), a lecturer (Vienna University),
    and a teacher (Vienna State College of Education). Therefore we might refer
    to his opinion as the view of a scholar. The discrepancy between positions
    like this one and the prosperity of Wikipedia obviously needs some explanation,
    but this is not the purpose of this paper.</p>
  <p>Wikipedia is one of the most successful phenomena of the
    so-called Web 2.0 and has already been a subject in <em>Museums and the Web</em> conferences.
    For example, Bowen and Angus (2006) suggested the relation between early
    conceptions of the Web and the realization in Wikipedia: &ldquo;provide information
    for others and read information from others&rdquo; (Bowen &amp; Angus, 2006). They
    also offered compact instructions on how to write and maintain articles about
    museums.</p>
  <p>In Germany, Vo&szlig; (2006) found that &ldquo;Wikis&rdquo; (Wiki, 2007)
    are rarely used in museums. Nobody seems to know exactly how many museums
    have initiated articles about their collections in Wikipedia, or which of
    the authors in Wikipedia are museum scholars or staff members. We also don&rsquo;t
    know if museum scholars benefit from reading in Wikipedia or write articles
    for it. In fact, we don&rsquo;t know anything about quantity or quality of usage
    by museum personnel. This is not surprising because most authors in Wikipedia
    are anonymous, either represented by an IP address only, or covered with
    a nickname preventing identification with a specific person in &quot;real
    life.&quot; However, we can detect articles about museums in the German Wikipedia
    as well as thematic lists, articles about museum objects and museum related
    subjects.</p>
  <p>There are significant features connecting Wikipedia with
    the world of libraries like the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> International
      Standard Book Number (ISBN: Wikipedia:ISBN, 2007; Wikipedia:ISBN-Suche, 2007),</li>
    <li> PubMed
      Unique Identifier (PMID: Wikipedia:PMID, 2006, Hilfe:Datenbanklinks, 2007),</li>
    <li> &ldquo;Name
      Authority File&rdquo; in the German National Library (PND:Personennamendatei, PND,
      2006; Personennamendatei, 2006; Hilfe:PND, 2007; Template:PND, 2006), or
      the</li>
    <li> Subject
      Headings Authority File in German libraries (SWD: Subject Headings Authority
      File, 2006; Schlagwortnormdatei, 2006; Vorlage:SWD,
      2006).</li>
	  </ul>
  <p>These features generate links to on-line sources maintained
    by libraries, and thus they provide access to content independent from Wikipedia.</p>
  <p>Libraries belong in the category of institutions, along
    with archives and museums, that are responsible for cultural heritage, or
    metaphorically speaking, they are guardians of the historic memory of mankind.
    This brings to mind the question of whether there are any signs of qualitative
    connections between Wikipedia and museums. This topic seems not to have been
    raised yet. Papers from the Museums and the Web conferences in 2005 and 2006
    deal with entries in the on-line encyclopedia about museums or the usage
    of Wikipedia. Also general remarks about Wikipedia regarding Web 2.0 are
    evident. Examining the annual conference of the &ldquo;Fachgruppe
    Dokumentation im Deutschen Museumsbund&rdquo; (Workgroup for Museum Documentation
    in the German Museum Association) in autumn, 2006,&nbsp; reveals no signs
    of intense discussion about the role of Wikipedia in the German museum community.
    However, at the same conference, many participants referred to Wikipedia
    in various contexts, so the subject seems to be interesting for at least
    some scholars in museums in Germany. But reviewing the discussions mentioned,
    there is no structured debate about Wikipedia and museums, neither in general,
    nor about specific subjects such as the possible role of Wikipedia in museums
    or in the research of scholars, or the approach of scholars to be authors
    in Wikipedia, or something similar.</p>
  <p>Therefore we can assume that museum scholars have no significant
    relationship to Wikipedia, and thus many of them might share the views of
    the general public provided by the media. Perspectives of Wikipedia, even
    in reliable magazines or on-line sources, often point out that anybody can
    write articles or change and delete content very easily. Even in the more
    sophisticated observations of Poe (2006), we find typical evidence of the
    more journalistic approach which is usually not very attractive to scholars.
    Although he starts with the interesting term &ldquo;collaborative knowledge,&rdquo; he
    later uses the subheading &ldquo;common knowledge&rdquo; which is likely to discourage
    experts and specialists from using Wikipedia, simply because it is their
    profession to create very special and distinguished knowledge. Also the public
    controversy between &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Encyclopaedia Britannica&rdquo; reported
    by Giles (2006) is not very condusive to encouraging scholars to make a closer
    study of the Web encyclopedia. While the method of comparing articles from &ldquo;Encyclopaedia Britannica&rdquo; and
    Wikipedia by a peer review group seems to be more scientific at first glance,
    the character of a news story is obvious. To restrict the investigation to
    the
    &ldquo;accuracy of ... science entries&rdquo; (Giles, 2006) of 42 articles reduces the
    importance of conclusions considerably. At least since the famous &ldquo;discovery&rdquo;
    of soccer in ancient Greece (Apopudobalia, 2006, August &amp; November) by
    Meier (1996) in a dignified encyclopedia of classical scholarship (Pauly-Wissowa,
    2007), we know that even traditional reference books by distinguished authors
    or publishers are not inerrable.</p>
  <p>A closer look at the relationship between scholars and
    reference books or on-line references can be more helpful in understanding
    their role in the practice of professionals. Most experts in museums are
    close to original sources such as objects in the collections and their documentation.
    For research, they try to benefit from publications of other scholars in
    their specific field as much as possible. Usually they need to consult works
    of reference only when leaving their own area of expertise, and they use
    the references to find more original sources or fundamental publications
    by other scholars. On the other hand, the contribution to a reference work
    can be part of scholarly activities. Therefore the accuracy of a reference
    might be important for the scholar who is responsible for the entry, but
    for the scholar who uses an encyclopedia, the reference has more the meaning
    of a map: it leads to other important original sources or publications &ndash; or
    not.</p>
  <p>To use these instruments of orientation in the world of
    knowledge, we need to know their functionality and structure. Like maps with
    different projections, scales, or symbols, there are many different reference
    works. Our professional training, methodological skills, knowledge about
    the specific field, and experience from practice of study enable us to evaluate
    the value of the single reference publication or the usefulness of each reference.</p>
  <p>We also have evidence for a more sophisticated view on
    Wikipedia. Most scholars would certainly agree that counting mistakes is
    not a very subtle instrument for measuring quality. On the other hand, the
    general remark of Vo&szlig; (2005) seems to be true for printed reference literature
    as well: &ldquo;The overall quality of Wikipedia mainly depends on your definition
    of (information) quality and the time scale you are interested in.&rdquo; More
    specifically Harcup and Nesbitt (2006) call the on-line encyclopedia &ldquo;a surprisingly
    authoritative reference source,&rdquo; holding interactivity responsible for this
    success to a great extent. At least Wikipedia itself is very clear about
    the function of references:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Wikipedia articles should be used for background information,
    as a reference for correct terminology and search terms, and as a starting
    point for further research. As with any community-built reference, there
    is a possibility for error in Wikipedia&rsquo;s content &ndash; please check
    your facts against multiple sources and read our disclaimers for more information
    (Wikipedia:Cite 2006).</p>
  <p>Therefore it seems to be reasonable that, in general,
    it is acceptable for scholars in museums to use Wikipedia. But many skills,
    tools, and experiences that we use to assess conventional reference books
    appear to fail with Wikipedia. Yet maybe the structures and processes behind
    the curtain are not as strange as they look from outside or through the eyes
    of mass media.</p>
  <h2>Collaborative Communities</h2>
  <p>Wikipedia can be used as in the beginning of this paper,
    where the citation of the entry &ldquo;Golden Girls&rdquo; offers additional reference
    for those who want background information or don&rsquo;t know that sitcom. You
    can follow the link to the &ldquo;Golden Girls,&rdquo; but that won't demonstrate the
    full potential of Wikipedia. We might compare this with people who run into
    a museum building to seek shelter from the rain without considering visiting
    the exhibition.</p>
  <p>However, for the purpose of this discussion we should
    see the organization of museums as a collaborative community. There is just
    one more basic premise necessary to make this definition appropriate for
    a museum in real life: the essential role of providing&nbsp; education for
    the general public. To regard education as a fundamental task for museums
    should not exclude entertaining elements in exhibitions or promotional efforts
    to generate money, for example, but it is important to make the primary responsibility
    of museums clear. With respect to that function in society, we can describe
    the collaborative community called &ldquo;Museum&rdquo; by its principal activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> collecting
      objects,</li>
    <li> providing
      documentation,</li>
    <li> creating
      knowledge about those objects and the representing fields of expertise, as
      well as</li>
    <li> presenting
      objects and information to the public.</li>
	  </ul>
  <p>For the purposes of this paper, this definition doesn&rsquo;t
    cover the complete function of a museum, but rather, the part of it to a
    large extent controlled by curators and museum scholars.</p>
  <p>Besides the collection of objects itself, the intellectual
    history of a given museum determines the character of the organization and
    other essential qualities of the institution. Therefore it is fundamental
    to include in this community previous scholars with their contributions to
    the intellectual resources.</p>
  <p>With the aid of this abstract model of a <em>knowledge-creating collaborative community,</em> we
    can explore the role of museums in the so-called information age, its connections
    with universities, libraries, and public education; and it might help to
    understand the position of scholars in the very dynamic processes concerning
    information: creation, transmission, verification, and conservation. Once
    we feel quite comfortable with this picture, we might have another look at
    Wikipedia, and may be surprised while reading Wikipedia:About&rdquo; (2007) to
    detect many similarities. The community of <em>Wikipedians</em> collects
    data and information pieces in order to generate articles, assemble categories,
    and build portals like the community of scholars in a museum which generates
    monographs, assembles exhibitions, and publishes catalogues. Despite the
    undoubted differences to be found, such as the more fluctuating structures,
    faster changing content, or diverse connections to other parts of society,
    the significant similarities justify a closer examination of Wikipedia.</p>
  <h2>Methods</h2>
  <p>Dialogue (Dialogue, 2007) and discussion or debate (Debate,
    2007) in different contexts and on many levels are essential in the professional
    life of scholars. However, access to these communications for others is quite
    limited. Outsiders hardly get an impression how the exchange of ideas happens.
    Even conferences provide an insight into those creative processes often for
    the participants only. Rather than offering different views on single subjects,
    published proceedings of a conference tend to reflect the intentions of speakers
    or results of debate dedicated to a number of principal topics. Publications
    representing controversial positions are often more suitable for obtaining
    an overview of the variety of ideas, but can also cloud the nuances of a
    creative discussion. Monographs provide the final outcome of a cognitive
    process, and only by means of footnotes, references, and citations can we
    derive some information about the process of how the scholar&rsquo;s knowledge
    grew. Even though the discussion or exchange of information is one of the
    most creative activities indeed, these types of publications are like filters.
    While extracting the juicy part of the fruit, we lose a lot of the texture.</p>
  <p>In Wikipedia there is a discussion page for each article
    which enables readers to follow the controversial or cooperative discussion.
    Using this, combined with the complete history of the article (Wikipedia:Help:Page
    history, 2006), they can track each step of an article&rsquo;s evolution and observe
    the participants closely. Furthermore, it is possible to collect more information
    about registered users by keeping track of their contributions or using other
    features of the user page (Wikipedia:User page, 2007). One of the downsides
    of these features is obvious: even for experienced users, and with helping
    tools (Toolserver Table of Contents, 2007) like Wikipedia Page History Statistics&rdquo; (2005)
    or &ldquo;Contribution Tree&rdquo; (2007), it takes a lot of effort in the beginning.
    But like attending a periodic conference, or while establishing themselves
    in the community of scholars, the <em>Wikipedians</em> get to know the area linked
    with their own activities depending on the intensity of their work.</p>
  <p>Writing in Wikipedia especially requires noticing conventions,
    manuals, and standards eventually. But in contrast to the regular scholar
    who acquires this methodological knowledge and its tools at university, the <em>Wikipedian</em> is
    encouraged to start editing even without it (Wikipedia:Introduction, 2007 Wikipedia:Five
    pillars, 2007). This might be one of the open secrets of Wikipedia&rsquo;s success:
    the low threshold between a reader and a contributing author. Even the more
    experienced user is not obliged to know every convention in detail as long
    as there is no obvious intention to neglect accepted rules (pretty sure to
    provoke resistance by other users or administrators). On the other hand,
    the evolution of guidelines and other conventions in Wikipedia can be studied
    as a process of acceptance and therefore be a good example for implementing
    standards in museums.</p>
  <p>The flexibility of both user roles and conventions allows
    users not only to create articles, contribute to existing articles or discussions,
    or participate in deletion (Wikipedia:Articles for deletion, 2007), but to
    take an active part in creating, changing, or discussing the methodic instruments
    as well. Because these instruments are part of the Wikimedia software, too,
    the design and development of methods and tools used in Wikipedia can be
    observed and studied with the same devices as the articles. Thus, such an
    important part of knowledge transfer from users to articles, categories or
    discussion pages is open to be observed, studied, and changed likewise.</p>
  <p>Although access to the corresponding methodology in museum-related
    scholarship is not restricted in general, we should consider at least two
    facts: implicit practice and habituation. The methods of research in museums
    are simply used rather than discussed. Especially the museum-related publications
    like catalogues do not provide the methodological background very often.
    There may be references to other sources providing relevant information about
    the techniques of research, but in general, the results are in the forefront.</p>
  <p>Most academics focus on the methodology of their field
    during their course of studies at&nbsp; university. While using these instruments
    for curatorial or related work at the museum, the individual scholar tends
    to trust their reliability rather than question them all the time. This enables
    us to concentrate on the multiple tasks of the daily life in a museum, but
    diminishes our potential of monitoring the effectiveness of our studies in
    the long run. However, intense communication with colleagues is very effective
    at keeping us on track. It is worth mentioning at this point the close affinity
    between the terms <em>collaborative</em>, <em>colleagues</em>, <em>communication</em> and <em>community</em>.</p>
  <h2>Practical Experience</h2>
  <p>The community of past and present museum scholars inherits
    the awareness of vast experience in accumulating expert knowledge from various
    resources. Although we realize the dynamic character of that process especially
    in the so-called information age, the impression of this knowledge is more
    a kind of stable treasure than an enormous but fluctuating cloud. Watching
    the growth and changes of an article in Wikipedia can teach us a lot about
    the difference between the levels of abstraction or precision while defining
    terms. It is common practice to imagine knowledge as being <em>in</em> a book, and there is evidence to suggest that many people
    treat Wikipedia as a collection of knowledge. This doesn&rsquo;t harmonize with
    another observation, though. </p>
  <p>The interaction of authors in Wikipedia can be seen as
    continual controversy, and consequently as the survival of the opinion of
    the most aggressive authors. Obviously this contradiction would not constitute
    trust at all. But the viewpoint will change significantly if we consider
    knowledge as &ldquo;generally personal, subjective, and inherently local,&rdquo; and
    therefore <em>shaped</em> by the
    &ldquo;existing perceptions and experiences&rdquo; of the knower (Hey, 2004). Personality
    development certainly includes interdependent patterns of status and relationships
    in society; therefore we might expect connections between personal knowledge
    and its representations in communities. Hence it is very convincing to consider
    the evolution of Wiki-texts as negotiation of knowledge by means of social
    processes (Schlieker, 2005). Furthermore, the perception of Wikipedia as
    part of a complex network of interacting people from different backgrounds
    with personal views as representations of individual knowledge seems to correspond
    well with one of the fundamental Wikipedia principles: the neutral point
    of view. The first sentence shall be cited here because of its importance
    for the content policy of Wikipedia:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral
    point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant
    views that have been published by a reliable source (Wikipedia:Neutral point
    of view, 2007).</p>
  <p>More thoughts about subjectivity and many-part conversations
    are published by Coldicutt and Streten (2005).</p>
  <p>Even people who only read Wikipedia should not be considered
    merely passive recipients of the content. Before the information actually
    becomes the knowledge of the reader, there are several
    &ldquo;filters&rdquo; to be passed, e.g.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> understanding
      the meaning,</li>
    <li> analysis
      and interpretation,</li>
    <li>trusting
      the source, including the separation of untrustworthy information pieces,</li>
   <li>comparison
     with recalled information from other sources,</li>
	  </ul>
  <p>and more. Of course especially for scholars, these filters
    definitely have multiple references to the community of scholars as well.</p>
  <p>Modeling the concept of knowledge as a complex process
    controlled by the knower, we come much closer to the role of scholar who
    is a keeper and creator of knowledge. To give up the imagination of &ldquo;<em>the</em> truth&rdquo; for a much more flexible
    concept of interdependent action of subjects or knowers might be not only
    a more sophisticated model to understand scholarship, but also a helpful
    background for acting in Wikipedia. At least as one benefit, scholars in
    Wikipedia could be able to gain better comprehension of the processes which
    originate knowledge.</p>
  <p>But is that really something new for the experienced scholar?
    We just have to remember a couple of well-known phenomena in the community
    of scholars, like disputes about a new theory, or different acceptance or
    valuation of the same source by different schools of thought. Some widely
    accepted theories of today once started as the very private opinion of just
    one scholar. But this would be too abstract to apply to Wikipedia without
    incorporating some observations about content as well.</p>
  <h2>Content</h2>
  <p>While the pure expression of a personal opinion can be
    questioned anytime, some new information or the linking and cross-linking
    with other information usually adds stability by incorporating content provided
    by others. For example, bibliographical information can be verified by others
    and with resources outside Wikipedia as well as with links to other articles
    and external links. Also, the compilation of metadata in articles such as
    those that summarize biographical information (Wikipedia:Persondata, 2007),
    or the linking with external sources such as mentioned before (ISBN, PMID,
    PND, SWD), not only has the potential of enhancing the quality of information
    but also can  be used as criterion for verification.</p>
  <p>The main structure of Wikipedia as a collection of articles
    supports individual reflection about the single entries, although this is
    moderated through the linking between articles already. In addition to the
    conventions and manuals about writing articles, there are features provided
    by the software or developed by the community to enhance the representation
    of valuable content itself as well as to enable improvements from simple
    corrections to inventing or enforcing standards. For example, templates (Wikipedia:Template
    namespace, 2007) can be used for labeling articles, for&nbsp; navigational
    elements, or for maintaining the same content or style in different articles.
    This now powerful instrument was not there in the beginning of the project
    and is therefore also a good example of the development of equipment by the
    community. The categories are another important organizing feature, as well
    as one of Wikipedia&rsquo;s own metadata (Wikipedia:Categorization, 2007). As a
    matter of fact, we have to be aware of similar dynamics as in the article <em>namespace</em>.
    Although the main categories can be stable for quite a while, a user just
    has to look at some discussion belonging to category pages to get an impression
    of the processes (Wikipedia:Categories for discussion, 2007). The German
    Wikipedia has a special project (Wikipedia:WikiProject, 2006) dedicated to
    the maintenance of the category system (Wikipedia:WikiProjekt Kategorien,
    2007).</p>
  <p>In the Wikipedia community, there are extra approaches
    for quality management (Wikipedia:Editorial oversight and control, 2007)
    which cannot be described in detail here. Some of the processes seem to be
    very technical and do not have corresponding practices in the communities
    of museum scholars, while others may look more familiar after adjustment
    to the different surrounding conditions.</p>
  <p>The shared media repository (<a href="../http://commons.wikimedia.org/" target="_blank">http://commons.wikimedia.org</a>)
    and so-called sister projects can only be mentioned here as other parts of
    the Wikimedia Foundation (<a href="../http://meta.wikimedia.org/" target="_blank">http://meta.wikimedia.org</a>)
    with the potential to enrich the content in Wikipedia.</p>
  <p>Last but not least, we should have a look at the benefits
    of the Wikipedias in other languages. Considering the correlations between
    information, knowledge, concepts, and thinking with language, the usefulness
    of these projects is self-evident. Scholars know the differences of traditions
    in their fields of expertise caused by language barriers as well as the connections
    built between specialists speaking the same language. In Wikipedia both effects
    can be observed when comparing articles belonging to the same term. Especially
    the more abstract entries like the ones about knowledge (Knowledge, 2007; Wissen, 2007)
    demonstrate strikingly that the intellectual concepts are not totally congruent.
    A simpler but effective advantage is the use of Wikipedia in another language
    if the article in the preferred one does not exist, or is not sufficient,
    or the user just needs to find more references. Also, authors can start an
    entry with a basic translation instead of starting their own research. As
    for the community, this seems to have the effect that a fast-growing Wikipedia
    in one language is an incentive for others to expand as well.</p>
  <h2>Contributors</h2>
  <p>Durbin
      (2005), Gaia, Boiano and Pasquali (2005), Chun and Jenkins (2005),
      as well as Harcup and Nesbitt (2006) have elaborated on the benefits of
      interactivity in general, and its value for the relationships between museums
      and their audience as well.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Interactivity also allows levels of engagement and participation
      to be scaled according to the needs and wants of different types of users
      and, unlike almost any other medium, a low-effort interaction on the part
      of the user can add a lot of value for others (Harcup and Nesbitt 2006).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This may also be the case for scholars and other museum
    staff as contributors in Wikipedia. As part of the Wikipedia community, they
    profit from the input and efforts of people outside the museum. At the same
    time, they get in touch with potential visitors of their museum or people
    such as students who are interested in the same subjects or fields of expertise
    while engaged in relevant articles. The growing public interest in Wikipedia
    alone might not be enough of an incentive to motivate museum scholars to
    work with it. However, this attitude may change once they recognize the increased
    efficiency in knowledge growth when these two sometimes disparate groups
    of people are brought together by means of well-defined subject headings
    of single entries in Wikipedia.</p>
  <p>In this context we should remember the conclusions of
    LaBar (2006) referring to participatory culture and public trust in museums.
    The task for museums to distribute information about cultural heritage is
    hardly to be questioned. But the close alliance between free distribution
    and public participation in Wikipedia can create new challenges. Hoffmann
    and Herczeg (2005) emphasize some aspects of motivation and reputation for
    contributors in participatory Wiki Webs. That may remind us of the similar
    function of publication lists in the scholar&rsquo;s community.</p>
  <h2>Museums, Scholars and Wikipedia</h2>
  <p>The previous observations and thoughts concerning Wikipedia
    may open a vast field of possible conclusions or ideas. This corresponds
    to the flexibility of the Wiki concept as well as the open character of the
    Wikipedia project and the evolution of the community. To be useful for those
    museum organizations or individual scholars who intend to participate in
    the on-line encyclopedia project, some major topics arising from the mentioned
    issues are selected for further consideration but are not intended to limit
    discussion in the professional forum. Moreover, the comments on the issues
    by the author are proposals to be discussed, changed, or amended by any interested
    colleague.</p>
  <h2>Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom</h2>
  <p>Which parts of the DIKW chain (DIKW, 2007) provide the
    most efficient connections between museums and the Wikipedia?</p>
  <p>Following Bellinger, Castro, and
      Mills (2004), who see the understanding of patterns as the transition
      between the levels of information and knowledge, we might agree that knowledge
      hardly can be assigned to a single article in Wikipedia, but either to
      a more complex entity containing information from articles, associative
      links, and other references, or to the members of the community involved,
      or both. Because the article is the basic structural element of Wikipedia,
      the data and information levels would then be the first choice for connections
      regarding specific entries. Notice that categories in Wikipedia with obvious
      analogies to specific fields of museum scholars or subject groups of museum
      objects fit in here as well. This is consistent with the mentioned model
      of knowledge as personal and subjective. In other words, individual scholars
      trying to bring into an article their knowledge about the subject and wanting
      to maintain it this way will probably fail, either because of the necessary
      effort to become widely accepted, or because of opposition from other contributors.</p>
  <p>On a more abstract level, there is also a good chance
    for a community of scholars to represent their area of expertise and related
    collections with coordinated activities, for example by maintaining a portal
    in Wikipedia (Wikipedia:Portal, 2007).</p>
  <h2>Access Points</h2>
  <p>Where are the easiest access points for scholars, and
    how can connections be built?</p>
  <p>Due to the mentioned role of articles in the intentions
    and structure of the project, this level is certainly the one to start with.
    Writing and editing articles can also serve as a practical introduction into
    Wikipedia and can serve as a starting point for those who plan to develop
    concepts of more sophisticated connections. One might think that knowledge
    of the software is sufficient for that, but keep in mind that there is a
    reason why &ldquo;Wikis&rdquo; are called <em>social</em> software
    (Social software, 2007). Comprehending the character and customs of the community
    processes may be essential for understanding the whole project and may prevent
    unnecessary efforts or even disappointments.</p>
  <p>The names of noteworthy objects in museums are, of course,
    prime candidates for entries in Wikipedia. But the structure and organization
    of museum documentation is often related to specific subjects of related
    fields or functional groups. For many of these terms, entries in Wikipedia
    exist already and can be enhanced with references to different types of museum
    documentation. If the documentation of a museum is presented on-line and
    the design takes connections to Wikipedia into account, adding respective
    links in Wikipedia can be standardized and even simplified with templates
    or other tools. Because of the popularity of Wikipedia (Vo&szlig;, 2006), connecting
    these access points with Wikipedia can be an agent to reach a wider audience.</p>
  <p>Additionally, we should have a look at the connections
    between search engines and Wikipedia. Taking into account the observations
    of Pratty (2006) about the &ldquo;search-dominated world&rdquo; of the Web, the prominent
    place of Wikipedia entries in Google&rsquo;s search results has some obvious effects.
    For example, we find in discussions about articles and elsewhere that people
    are aware of the importance of place in the list. The large number of entries
    also might enable the use of Wikipedia as a &ldquo;find engine&rdquo; or &ldquo;help-to-find
    engine&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>For those who are interested in the popularization of
    museum content and public access to museum documentation, the discussion
    of individual articles may not be productive enough at large, although talks
    about subject related entries can provide comprehensive material for further
    study. Anyhow, areas such as the following might be more appropriate for
    the scholar concerned with the general public:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>collaborations
      (Wikipedia:Collaborations, 2007),</li>
    <li>portals
      (Wikipedia:Portal, 2007),</li>
    <li>projects
      (Wikipedia:WikiProject, 2006), or</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Redaktionen&rdquo; in
      the German Wikipedia (Wikipedia:Redaktionen, 2007).</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Some special thoughts should be included here about
      possible connections between Wikipedia and two promising types of projects
      in the museum community:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> CIDOC
      Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC
      Conceptual Reference Model, 2006),</li>
    <li> vocabularies
      and thesauri.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The need to adopt the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model
    in the &ldquo;universe of discourse&rdquo; in museum documentation or to use it for information
    management regarding the Semantic Web has been presented by Stein et al.
    (2005) and Lowndes (2006). But they noticed the limited implementation of
    the CIDOC CRM at the same time. Of course Wikipedia is not an ontology (Ontology:
    computer science, 2007) for lack of formal structure. But the on-line encyclopedia
    seems to share some elements of the function of ontology. Some reflections
    in the study of Lowndes (2006) may lead to the assumption to regard Wikipedia
    as kind of &ldquo;irregular&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;more provoking&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;&ldquo;chaotic&rdquo; ontology. Articles can be
    seen as describing terms or concepts while links and other references specify
    relationships between them. Therefore the study of Wikipedia by museum scholars
    could generate ideas for the expanded understanding and use of the highly
    abstract ontology for cultural heritage information.</p>
  <p>Coburn and Baca (2004) suggested that &ldquo;museums have begun
    to take seriously the audience of users who may want access to their collections
    even if those users will never physically visit their museums&rdquo;. Wikipedia
    could be a perfect object for studies to cope with the task of enabling users
    with many and varied &ldquo;profiles, needs and information-seeking behaviors [... to]
    be successful in finding what they are looking for&rdquo; (Coburn
    &amp; Baca, 2004). The same authors also expect the aggregation of all relevant
    information about the objects in a collection to be handled by the collections
    management systems. This raises the question of how to incorporate relevant
    information from outside the museum efficiently. Research about Wikipedia
    dealing with such various information sources could present some useful results
    to answer this question.</p>
  <p>Coburn (2006) highlights the significance of structured
    vocabularies for the accessibility of museum documentation in these areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Description</li>
    <li>Identification</li>
   <li> Interpretation</li>
    </ul>
  <p>She also deals with the importance of &ldquo;creating access
    points for the non-scholarly audience&rdquo; (Coburn, 2006). For many museum objects,
    Wikipedia has content useful for descriptive (e.g. descriptive terms, material
    and technique), identifying (e.g. names of persons), or interpretative (e.g.
    technical terms) information. Wikipedia&rsquo;s own structures on different levels
    will often provide even more connotation than vocabularies with flatter hierarchies
    or structures of lesser dimensions. Last but not least, the simple linking
    with a term in Wikipedia requires much less effort than maintaining their
    own vocabulary or referring to expert thesauri. Wikipedia as conjunction
    between other resources or reference itself has been described strikingly:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A reference to 'English language' in Wikipedia, for example,
      will bring into the world of the original resource all the references from
      the Wikipedia article. This may include information that the creator of the
      original resource does not even know (Nevile, Kateli and Pulis 2006).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the viewpoint of efficiency and technology, Wikipedia
    has instruments worth being studied and used by scholars:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> database
      links (Linking to databases, 2004; Hilfe:Datenbanklinks, 2007),</li>
    <li> templates
      (Wikipedia:Template namespace, 2007) and variables (Help:Variable, 2006;
      Hilfe:Variablen, 2007),</li>
    <li> tools
      (Wikipedia:Tools, 2007; Wikipedia:Hilfsmittel, 2007), and</li>
    <li> special
      projects (e.g. Category:Mass content adding, 2006; Category:Wikipedia resources
      for researchers, 2006).</li>
	  </ul>
  <p>Possible results could be not only abstract knowledge
    about methods and tools, but also interfaces between museum vocabularies
    like the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (Getty Thesaurus of Geographic
    Names, 2007) and Wikipedia (Wikipedia:WikiProject Geographical coordinates,
    2007).</p>
  <h2>Museum activities</h2>
  <p>In general we should consider museum activities generating
    information for different purposes, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> museum
      documentation,</li>
    <li> research,</li>
    <li> public
      access to information in the museum,</li>
    <li>publications,</li>
    <li> educational
      material.</li>
	  </ul>
  <p>Bowen and Angus (2006) have already listed a number of
    practical utilizations of Wikipedia in museums. Although scholars participate
    in some of those tasks, there are other activities with more academic character,
    such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> ontologies
      and reference techniques,</li>
    <li> methods
      to verify information in museum documentation, or</li>
    <li> critical
      use of sources.</li>
	  </ul>
  <p>We should see these as interdependent exchange, because
    the knowledge of museum scholars in their fields of expertise and about museum
    practice is valuable for Wikipedia, too. Furthermore, the practice of dealing
    with multiple fields, subjects, and experiences may enrich the customary
    communication with colleagues and usage of conventional references which
    are based on their own area of expertise and professional experience. Likewise
    the common growth from idea to publication fed by the single use of resources
    and references could be enlarged to become a networking process within the
    Wikipedia community where the multiple use of resources can reduce the efforts
    of the individual.</p>
  <p>Benefits are not limited to the more strategic objectives.
    In this paper many references to Wikipedia provide access to more information.
    While writing this paper the author (User:ThT, 2006) added the entry for
    the
    &ldquo;CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model&rdquo; (2006) and some links to Wikipedia. This
    has made bits of possibly useful information accessible to others through
    a variety of ways.</p>
  <h2>Tools for Museums</h2>
  <p>What are possible tools that would enable the use of Wikipedia,
    and which tools are missing?</p>
  <p>The implements developed in the Wikipedia community are
    accessible easily in the project itself. But we could also imagine tools
    in applications for museum documentation like &ldquo;The Museum System (TMS)&rdquo; taking
    advantage of Wikipedia for various purposes.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Projects like Wikipedia still seem to be distant from
    the world of museum scholars in different ways. But the past, ongoing, and
    projected activities of museums in the Web should take that successful idea
    of free references into account. It is to be hoped that&nbsp; these observations
    and conclusions can provide a base for more thoughts and practical steps.</p>
