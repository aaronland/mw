        <h1>1. Introduction (David
        Green and Rob Lancefield)</h1>
        <p>How
        can museums ensure that digital images from their collections are effectively
        distributed and used by educators? Recent reports offer key findings
        about how digital images are currently being used in higher education,
        and a variety of innovative initiatives are under way to enable digital
        images from museum collections to serve more effectively the needs and
        practices of educators in the humanities, arts, and sciences.</p>
    <p>According
        to the evidence, still images, often sourced from museums, are the most
        heavily used type of digital resource in higher education today. With
        greater availability and flexibility than their analog counterparts,
        digital images are beginning to affect much teaching practice. This,
        in turn, leads to increased demand for suitable images, and thus to new
        opportunities for museums. These rapidly expanding areas of practice
        in image production, delivery, and pedagogical use raise a host of questions
        such as these:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where
        are educators finding digital images to use in teaching and research?</li>
      <li>What
        kinds of image content, metadata, formats, and quality are these educators
        seeking?</li>
      <li>How
        do museums support image discovery and use, and in what new ways might
        they do so?</li>
      <li>What
        are the economic and public-interest arguments for supplying images free
        of charge for educational use, and how do these connect to museums&rsquo; institutional
        missions and cultural roles?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To
        propose answers to some of these questions, this paper brings together
        a variety of viewpoints. First, it summarizes the major findings of two
        recent reports on how digital resources in general, and digital images
        in particular, are used by educators, what their emerging needs appear
        to be, and what the implications might be for museums. This is followed
        by a brief review of just three examples of innovative initiatives seeking
        to connect digital images from museum collections with the needs and
        practices of educators&mdash;in the sciences as well as in the arts and
        humanities. We conclude with key lessons from the evaluation of the usefulness
        for teaching of the Web-based museum collections of the Museums and Online
        Archive of California (MOAC).</p>
    <h1>2. Use
          and Users of Digital Resources (Diane
          Harley)</h1>
    <p><em>Use
          and Users of Digital Resources</em> (Harley
          et al., 2006) is a two-year study recently published by the Center
          for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley.
          The project investigated how, how much, and even <em>if</em> digital
          resources are being used in targeted Humanities and Social Sciences
          teaching and learning contexts among diverse higher education communities.
          The research included discussion groups and a survey of full- and part-time
          faculty and graduate students from two types of higher education institutions.
          In order to elicit responses as unbiased as possible, the report assiduously
          avoided judgments about the &ldquo;value&rdquo; of specific resources.
          Major findings included:<strong></strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Personal
        Teaching Style</strong>: The degree to which personal teaching style and
        philosophy influence resource use was striking. There is a broad spectrum
        of user types, ranging from the non-user, to the inexperienced-novice
        user, to the highly proficient and advanced user of digital resources.
        Non-users included those who were passionately opposed to the use of
        technologies in their classroom for a variety of valid pedagogical
        reasons (e.g., these technologies cannot substitute for a faculty member&rsquo;s
        preferred teaching approaches). Non-users also included self-described
        enthusiasts frustrated by technical and non-technical barriers, and
        those simply without time to think about, let alone use, technology
        in teaching.</li>
      <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Faculty
        use almost every conceivable type of digital resource, many of which
        fall outside of what are formally called &ldquo;collections&rdquo; or &ldquo;educational.&rdquo; Images
        and visual materials were the most frequently used resources, and they
        were often used for classroom presentation or posting on the Web. News
        and other media resources, video, and on-line reference sources were also
        heavily used. Google-type searches were the most frequent way in which
        faculty found resources. A faculty member&rsquo;s own &ldquo;collection&rdquo; of
        digital resources was the second most frequent source of material (70%).
        Curricular materials were relatively low on the list of what faculty
        said they used.</li>
      <li><strong>Uses:</strong> Faculty
        respondents used digital resources to improve their students&rsquo; learning,
        to integrate primary source materials into their teaching, to provide
        students with context for a topic, to include materials or teaching methods
        that would otherwise be unavailable, and/or to integrate faculty research
        interests into a course. Less frequently cited were teaching critical
        thinking, increasing convenience for themselves and/or students, and/or
        meeting expectations held by their students or their colleagues. Faculty
        in different disciplines require different types of resources, and they
        use them in different ways and for different reasons.</li>
      <li><strong>Obstacles</strong>: The
        foremost reason for not using digital resources was that they simply
        did not support faculty&rsquo;s teaching approaches. Lack of time was
        a major constraint. Faculty&mdash;including those active and enthusiastic
        in their use of digital resources&mdash;identified many obstacles to
        using these resources for teaching, including how to find, manage, maintain,
        and reuse them in new contexts. Oft-cited obstacles to their effective
        use were the availability, reliability, and expense of the necessary
        equipment, both in the classroom and for personal use. Many want to build
        their own re-aggregated resources, using their own materials and mixing
        them with resources they have collected along the way. There may be an
        array of tools available for collecting, developing, managing, and actually
        using resources, but the efficacy and interoperability of these tools
        is questionable.</li>
      <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Faculty
        use a variety of strategies for negotiating the digital morass. For most,
        the path of least resistance is the one usually taken&mdash;a Google
        search, a walk down the hall or an e-mail to a colleague, a visit to
        the Web site of a trusted archive, or often a personal and eclectic &ldquo;collection&rdquo; of
        digital stuff. What is deemed &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; for users will
        depend on the problem at hand; a single individual may have different
        standards and strategies that are determined by the immediate objective,
        time constraints, budgets, personal and institutional equipment, and
        support staff, among other variables.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We
        should not expect faculty, whom we can assume know more than non-specialists
        about teaching their subject, to shoehorn their approaches into a technical
        developer&rsquo;s ideas of what is valuable or the correct pedagogical
        approach. Tools and resources must be developed to support what faculty
        want to do.</p>
    <p>The
        challenges faced by those charged with building tools to re-aggregate
        varied resources for easier use include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The difficulty, if not current
          impossibility, of re-aggregating objects that are bundled and &ldquo;locked&rdquo; into
          fixed, often proprietary resources;</li>
      <li>The need to manage and interpret
          digital rights throughout processes which may include pulling data
          from one resource for integration into another;</li>
      <li>The unevenness of interface
          usability and aesthetics (in some disciplines, such as art history,
          faculty may care a lot about resolution quality, while in other disciplines,
          faculty may create &ldquo;hodgepodge&rdquo; resources, often not caring
          about varying resolution quality from one image to the next);</li>
      <li>The growing demand from users
          for granularity (e.g., the ability to search and find the one particular
          image or piece of text they need within an entire resource);</li>
      <li>The issue of knowing about
          and finding digital objects&mdash;many faculty have no idea about the
          existence of local and non-local resources, especially licensed resources,
          that may be available to them.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>3. Using
          Digital Images in Teaching and Learning (David
          Green and Rob Lancefield)</h1>
    <p>A
        smaller study, more specifically focused on digital images than was the
        Harley study, was commissioned in 2005 by Wesleyan University and the
        National Institute for Technology and Liberal Education (NITLE) to examine
        the impact of the use of digital images on teaching practices in liberal
        arts colleges in the Northeast. The study, <em>Using Digital Images in
        Teaching and Learning: Perspectives from Liberal Arts Institutions</em> (Green,
        2006), made it apparent that digital images are revolutionizing many
        teachers&rsquo; approaches to their students and their teaching despite
        a fleet of obstacles&mdash;from difficulties in finding the right material
        efficiently, or in optimally displaying it, to the often colossal amount
        of time taken by faculty (often in lieu of sufficient institutional support)
        for aggregating and integrating images from different resources, as well
        as managing and cataloging personal collections.</p>
    <p>More
        than 500 faculty and staff in a wide range of disciplines at 33 institutions
        participated in the study. Faculty were self-selected, mostly convinced
        by the digital promise that abundant images in a flexible format could
        ease and animate their teaching. So while this is not a statistically
        valid sample of all faculty at liberal arts colleges, it does chart important
        trends and address serious policy questions. Survey responses and interviews
        showed that in many cases, image-based investigations are supplementing
        or even, in a few instances, replacing text-based knowledge. This emerging
        practice is having a major impact on teaching and learning, and it presents
        great opportunities despite potential obstacles. Appreciating the abundance
        and variety of images available, faculty are using more images, more
        often, in more contexts&mdash;and they are demanding more from these
        visual resources. How do they find the right images for the job?</p>
    <h2>Image
        Sources and Invisible Resources</h2>
    <p>Digital
        images come from multiple sources. Most popular are faculty&rsquo;s own
        personal digital image collections (used by 90% of faculty). While these
        collections comprise images from many sources (including scans from books
        and personal slide collections), most of their content comes from the
        Web. The Web was used as an image source by 85% of faculty in this study.
        Only 30% used licensed resources, 19% used departmental resources, and
        14% used their campus libraries as places to find digital images.</p>
    <p>Celebrating
        the abundance of images found on-line via image search engines, faculty
        insistently call, however, for more dependable, higher-quality resources
        than Google Images typically turns up. Many cultural institutions, government
        agencies, scholarly associations, and individuals have assembled such
        databases; but ironically they were often unknown by the image-using
        faculty in this study&mdash;they were consulted by just one third. The
        National Science Digital Library, for example, has a structure for creating
        peer-reviewed, discipline-based teaching resources that individual faculty
        can contribute to, working with lead organizations designated for a particular
        field&mdash;for example, with the American Association for the Advancement
        of Science and its BiosciEdNet portal for biological sciences (<a href="../http://www.biosciednet.org/" target="_blank">http://www.biosciednet.org</a>).
        However, frequently faculty who could benefit from such a resource knew
        nothing of it.</p>
    <p>What
        can be done to connect potential users with museum Web resources? In
        the survey responses, faculty rarely cited museums as on-line resources:
        seven mentioned specific museums, and three referred to museums in general.
        Yet museums have the potential to be more substantial partners in the
        image-based revolution transforming much of teaching today&mdash;and
        with image-based subjects, transforming the canon. How can museums best
        produce, present, and distribute images to be more useful to faculty?</p>
    <h2>Educator
        Needs</h2>
    <p>Key
        requirements for making images useful to educators are increasingly clear.
        Museums that design and provide access to digital images in ways that
        help meet these needs will encourage more and better educational use
        of these resources. First is the ability to discover &ldquo;just right&rdquo; images
        without having to negotiate multiple search locations and interfaces,
        via the kinds of aggregation or federated search that many museums have
        long been working towards; the powerful attraction to faculty of at least
        some sense of &ldquo;one-stop shopping&rdquo; is clear in the study&rsquo;s
        findings regarding the widespread use of Google Images.</p>
    <p>Second
        is the ability to easily download&mdash;and to aggregate and seamlessly
        integrate&mdash;such discovered images on the Web with others from private
        collections on local, personal computers for educational use. Following
        from this is the need for a range of metadata to be incorporated in or
        closely associated with images. Such metadata not only assists in the
        integration of images into local collections; it also facilitates their
        easy discovery and retrieval for a variety of purposes.</p>
    <p>Educators
        also need to be assured of the copyright status of images and to be unintrusively
        informed, in clear and simple language, about how they can and cannot
        use them. This might include information about re-directing and sharing
        images with other faculty, either locally or via systems such as the
        Penn State Lionshare authenticated peer-to-peer network (<a href="../http://lionshare.its.psu.edu/" target="_blank">http://lionshare.its.psu.edu/</a>).</p>
    <h2>Opportunities
        for Museums</h2>
    <p>This
        set of needs suggests a number of opportunities for museums. Many of
        these opportunities resonate with long-lived topics of discussion and
        effort in the museum community, and many connect to programs and projects
        under development:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>While
        continuing to license digital images directly and via intermediaries,
        museums might more actively and cooperatively participate in creating
        robust, Web-based community resources whereby related high-quality images
        from multiple institutions may more easily be discovered and used.</li>
      <li>In
        developing new means of providing images for educational use, museums
        could increase the utility (and likelihood of use) of images in ways
        that most transparently support integrated use of their images with others
        from teachers&rsquo; own, locally managed collections. In providing metadata,
        museums should also be aware of the potentially very broad use of any
        image across many disciplines.</li>
      <li>Integral
        to the provision of images, museums can work to publicize these resources&rsquo; availability
        to faculty more widely, via scholarly societies and IT, library and other
        staff assisting in faculty support (through on-line and offline means
        for publicizing digital resources and how they can be used for teaching
        and learning).</li>
      <li>In
        possible connection with the first two recommendations, museums can explore
        ways in which they might band together using Web 2.0 technologies to
        foster the collaborative provision and educational use of images across
        institutions and among teachers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Already
        attractive to many museums as general avenues for sharing the visual
        riches they hold, these areas of work also provide more specific opportunities
        to help serve teaching and learning in ways we now more clearly understand.</p>
    <p>We
        will now briefly visit three examples of work being conducted by and with
        museums to connect museum visual resources with educators.</p>
    <h1>4. The Exploratorium (Sherry
        Hsi)</h1>
    <p>At
        San Francisco&rsquo;s Exploratorium (&ldquo;the museum of science, art
        and human perception&rdquo;), educators (including K&ndash;12 teachers,
        informal educators, university professors, and parents) are one of three
        primary target audiences for the museum. &ldquo;Educate,&rdquo; a portal
        to serve educators, can be found at the top level of the main Web site
        of the Exploratorium (<a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/" target="_blank">http://www.exploratorium.edu</a>).
        As many as 136,000 unique on-line visitors and over 10,000 educators,
        who have participated in the Exploratorium&rsquo;s museum-based teaching
        programs, regularly use this area of the Web site not only to acquire
        activities, table-top exhibit designs, podcasts, digital videos, computer
        interactives and on-line exhibits but also to contribute newly developed
        learning resources to the collection.</p>
    <p>Digital
        library collections offer an important way to organize and access digital
        resources for educators. Metadata is key here, especially given that
        on-line search tools often cannot discover or locate the Exploratorium&rsquo;s
        many unique digital resources. As a consequence, the Exploratorium's
        digital library includes different sets of metadata that index digital
        resources to metadata standards for learning objects and to vocabularies
        used by teachers, so that resources can be searchable by other libraries.</p>
    <p>For
        example, the Learning Resources Collection (<a href="../http://nsdl.exploratorium.edu/" target="_blank">http://nsdl.exploratorium.edu</a>)
        includes metadata vital for teachers: teaching tips, school grade levels,
        and various curricular areas, for example. These resources gain more
        visibility and use through open metadata standards and interoperability
        with other libraries, such as the National Science Digital Library.</p>
    <p>The
        Exploratorium&rsquo;s Digital Asset Archive (<a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/educate/dl.html" target="_blank">http://www.exploratorium.edu/educate/dl.html</a>),
        institutionally the largest and most historic on-line collection, contains
        over 13,300 digital images related to interactive exhibits and scientific
        phenomena. The archive allows users to search by scientific phenomena,
        author, exhibit, date, exhibition, media type, and other criteria relevant
        to museum staff and educators. To make access easy for educators, no
        logins are required to gain access; and media, including low-resolution
        images, are available free of charge.</p>
    <p>One
        example of how educators use the Exploratorium&rsquo;s image resources
        can be seen in its Microscope Imaging Station exhibit (<a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/imaging_station" target="_blank">http://www.exploratorium.edu/imaging_station</a>).
        Here, high-magnification images of life forms, such as stem cells and
        cells undergoing mitosis, catalogued in the digital library, can be printed
        out and used in the classroom to ask students, for example, what phase
        of mitosis is being shown and under what sequence of biological development
        the images should be placed. Using a calculator and ruler, teachers can
        also use these images as part of a math activity, for example by measuring
        the relative size of the nucleus to the cell cytoplasm in images taken
        in a time lapse to estimate growth rates.</p>
    <p>Using
        the Web site as a content repository to support science teaching is the
        most common way educators have been using Exploratorium resources. The
        Web site is also used as a market and audience research tool. For example,
        the Institute for Inquiry Web site (<a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/ifi" target="_blank">http://www.exploratorium.edu/ifi</a>)
        has an on-line form that collects additional information about visitors
        using a Java-based pop-up window. on-line visitors interested in downloading
        a resource guide are first asked to provide demographic information and
        resource preferences, and to answer other questions that can opt them
        into on-line educator communities, e-newsletter subscriptions, and other
        resources. This embedded data collection verifies that educators, in
        particular professional developers, are locating a useful digital resource.</p>
    <p>To
        sustain the use of digital images (as well as other digital resources),
        the Exploratorium uses PDFs, Webcasts, and many-to-many communication
        strategies to establish longer-term relationships with audiences and
        to build a community. on-line bulletin boards, scheduled live text chat
        sessions, and near real-time email response during Webcasts invite input,
        explanation, and dialogue from remote educator audiences. Other many-to-many
        communication experiments are under way, including simultaneous video
        projection during a live museum Webcast in Second Life, a multi-user
        participatory 3D virtual world.</p>
    <p>While
        Web 2.0 is enabling more and more end-user content development of Web sites,
        the Exploratorium still maintains a purposefully-designed, curatorial
        and editorial process in selecting which Web sites to develop and which
        images to add to on-line collections for educators. This process includes
        ensuring that intellectual property conditions are met, both high- and
        low-resolution versions of images are made available, museum branding
        guidelines are followed, the science information is correct, and educational
        standards are considered. Teachers are part of the team in developing
        resources, but so are artists, scientists, museum developers, media producers,
        and other stakeholders. This designed and crafted perspective of the
        Web site ensures that high-quality materials are ultimately delivered
        to educator audiences.</p>
    <h1>5. The Museum Collection Sharing Working
        Group: Accelerating Availability of Museum Images (G&uuml;nter
        Waibel)</h1>
    <p>In
        his article &quot;Public Domain Art in an Age of Easier Mechanical Reproducibility&quot;
      (2006)<em>,</em> Ken Hamma
        argues in favor of a new policy for museums: rather than covet a rarely
        realized revenue stream from licensing, museums should place all their
        digital images into the public domain unless the original artwork remains
        restricted by copyright. Needless to say, the implementation of such
        a policy in US museums would make significant amounts of high-quality
        content available to researchers, teachers, and learners.</p>
    <p>With
        the publication of <em>Cataloging Cultural Objects</em> (Baca,
        2006), the release of CDWA Lite XML (<a href="../http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/cdwalite.html" target="_blank">http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/cdwalite.html</a>), and
        the successful implementation of both specifications in conjunction with
        the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)
        (<a href="../http://www.openarchives.org/" target="_blank">http://www.openarchives.org</a>)
        by the Getty Trust, the technological underpinnings to deliver on such
        a policy are firmly in place. The museum community now has a complete
        suite of standards to describe and share digital images: Cataloging Cultural
        Objects provides the rules for describing digital images; CDWA Lite XML
        provides the format to encode the descriptions; and OAI-PMH provides
        a mechanism to economically share the descriptions.</p>
    <p>In
        May 2006, RLG Programs/OCLC inaugurated the Museum Collection Sharing
        Working Group (<a href="../http://www.rlg.org/en/page.php?Page_ID=335" target="_blank">http://www.rlg.org/en/page.php?Page_ID=335</a>) in
        order to promote this nascent suite of standards. While most of the ten
        participating institutions still remain ambivalent about circulating
        digital images as freely as Hamma envisions, they all see the economic
        benefits of having an infrastructure for sharing their content with trusted
        partners such as ARTstor, the Internet Archive, a university running
        MDID, or any of the organizations offering AMICO-successor databases.
        In addition, some of the group members, such as the Metropolitan Museum
        of Art (Chun, 2006) and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (Bailey, 2006)
        have initiated fee-free licensing programs for educational use.</p>
    <p>The
        diverse members of the Museum Collection Sharing Working Group provide
        each other with a support environment for implementing sharing technologies.
        Among the chief hurdles for getting museum data into a shareable format
        are the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mapping
        data in the collections management system to CDWA Lite</li>
      <li>Exporting
        data out of the collections management system</li>
      <li>Transforming
        data into CDWA Lite XML</li>
      <li>Setting
        up an OAI server</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At
        this point, group members have shared their mapping documents on the
        project wiki, and discussed various issues related to concatenating/dissecting
        data so it will fit the categories described in CDWA Lite, as well as
        bringing data into conformity with the rules laid out by CCO. The group
        monitors developments of tools in the community that could have an impact
        on their set of issues&mdash;for example, Richard Rinehart of the UC
        Berkeley Art Museum demonstrated a database tool for transforming collections
        management system data into XML (<a href="../http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/moac/community_toolbox.html" target="_blank">http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/moac/community_toolbox.html</a>).</p>
    <p>The
        working group is also playing an active role in shaping a new tool for
        the museum community. The Getty implementation of OAI uses a slightly
        modified version of OAICat Open Source Software (<a href="../http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.htm" target="_blank">http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.htm</a>),
        originally written by Jeff Young (OCLC Programs &amp; Research). The
        working group will build on the Getty modifications and, in collaboration
        with Jeff Young and working group liaison G&uuml;nter Waibel, determine
        functional specifications for a museum-specific open source release of
        OAICat.</p>
    <p>Once the infrastructure
      for sharing has become widely implemented, the cost for museums to share,
      the cost for aggregators to create union resources, and the cost for higher
      education to use digital images will dramatically diminish. While this
      group of determined professionals only represents ten museums, hopefully
      their work will have a snowball effect: the more institutions successfully
      share their content, the more other museums will follow.</p>
    <h1>6. Initiative to Provide Digital Images to
      Scholars at No Charge (Susan Chun)</h1>
    <p>In a new initiative designed
      to assist scholars with teaching, study, and the publication of academic
      works, The Metropolitan Museum of Art will distribute, free of charge,
      high-resolution digital images from an expanding array of works in its
      renowned collection for use in academic publications. This new service
      is available through ARTstor, a non-profit organization that makes art
      images available for educational use.</p>
    <p>&quot;The Metropolitan Museum
      of Art has long sought to address the significant challenges that scholars
      confront in seeking to secure and license images of objects from the Museum's
      collections,&quot; stated Metropolitan Museum Director Philippe de Montebello
      in making the announcement. &quot;We hope, through this collaboration,
      to play a pioneering role in addressing one of the profound challenges
      facing scholars in art history, and scholarly publishing, today.&quot;</p>
    <p>Initially approached by
      the Metropolitan Museum in 2005 to develop this initiative, ARTstor has
      worked in close consultation with Metropolitan Museum staff to create its
      new service, entitled &quot;Images for Academic Publishing&quot; (IAP),
      which will make images available via software on the ARTstor Web site (www.artstor.org).
      Initially, nearly 1,700 images representative of the broad range of the
      Metropolitan Museum's encyclopedic collection will be available through
      the more than 730 institutions that currently license ARTstor. Efforts
      to expand this accessibility are now underway and will be announced by
      ARTstor at a later date. </p>
    <p>Having briefly reviewed educators&rsquo; use of digital images and their
      needs in discovering and using images in the classroom, and having glimpsed
       innovative approaches to connecting museum images with educators, we
      now look at an important example of the evaluation of an existing robust
      set of Web-based teaching resources for educators: those from the Museums
      and Online Archive of California (MOAC). In its underscoring some of the
      key findings of the studies that opened this paper, this evaluation serves
      both to cycle back to those reports and to lay groundwork for further strategizing
      by museums seeking ways to bring their works into the classroom.</p>
    <h1>7. MOAC II: Depth, Breadth, And Diversity
        Wanted (Layna White)</h1>
    <p>The
        Museums and the Online Archive of California II User Evaluation (MOAC
        II) was a research project (2003&ndash;2005) examining the use and usefulness
        of selected, digitized cultural content made freely available through
        the Web sites of the Online Archive of California, a content aggregation
        portal operated by the California Digital Library (<a href="../http://www.oac.cdlib.org/" target="_blank">http://www.oac.cdlib.org/</a>)
        and the Museums and Online Archives Collaboration (MOAC), hosted by the
        UC Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (<a href="../http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/moac/" target="_blank">http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/moac/</a>).</p>
    <p>MOAC
        is a multi-year collaboration between several California museums, an
        archive, and a digital library, with the goal of increasing access to
        cultural content&mdash;in this case, aggregated text and images representing
        physical collections and presented as finding aids as well as individual
        digital objects delivered independently of those finding aids.</p>
    <p>The
        user evaluation brought together MOAC partners and researchers from the
        UCLA Department of Information Studies (principally Anne J. Gilliland)
        to examine the needs and behaviors of four user groups in their use of
        MOAC content in the two Web sites. These groups comprised K&ndash;12 teachers,
        university students, academics in the humanities and social sciences,
        and information professionals working in museums, libraries, and archives.</p>
    <p>Following
        are some sample guiding questions from the evaluation, paired with representative
        faculty responses. Anne Gilliland led MOAC II partners in gathering and
        triangulating both quantitative and qualitative data from many sources:
        pre-existing use data, transaction logs, feedback forms, detailed questionnaires,
        and think-aloud sessions (White, 2006).</p>
    <h2>What types of search strategies are users
      attempting and how successful are they?</h2>
    <p>The
        top searches favored by all participants were subject, names of artists/makers,
        object titles, and types of media. Some participants expressed surprise
        or confusion over unexpected search results: <em>why are these things
        coming up [in search results]?</em> Several
        educators indicated that they could not find what they were looking for
        or expected in MOAC: <em>where is the contemporary art?</em> Such
        responses naturally prompt questions about the matchability of the content
        provided to user expectations and preferences, as well as the need to
        better inform people about what is included in MOAC, and possibly why.</p>
    <p>Teachers
        and faculty rated consistency of presentation highly; this is a potential
        challenge for aggregation projects like MOAC, given differences in institutional
        practices, priorities, and sensibilities. Idiosyncrasies exist in descriptions
        for individual digital objects, in extent, detail, and choice of words.</p>
    <h2>Why and how do teachers and faculty use digitized
      cultural objects?</h2>
    <p>Participants
        wanted retrieval through context (such as connections between and among
        objects, people, places, times, and events) in addition to retrieval
        by subjects, names, and media for individual digital objects. What kinds
        of context need to be provided and supported, from whose perspective,
        and in what manner of presentation? Finding aids appeared to provide
        one means of communicating <em>some</em> context
        to users about partners&rsquo; collections; however, MOAC II confirmed
        that teachers and faculty are not very interested in using finding aids
        to get context.</p>
    <h2>Looking at images with students helps them
      build a vocabulary about visual material and helps them gain an understanding
      of time and place.</h2>
    <p>Images
        were the biggest selling point for participants. The evaluation results
        underscore user interest in mixing and matching ad hoc, related images
        (and text) in resources like MOAC, with materials from other Web sites
        and images in personal collections, as well as information from books,
        articles, and people.</p>
    <p>From
        MOAC II and other evaluative work, partners noted an increasing emphasis&mdash;by
        users and content providers&mdash;on developing clusters of related content
        presented in predetermined contextual arrangements (structures other
        than finding aids), while still supporting quick access to individual
        digital objects.</p>
    <p>In
        general, MOAC II results call for more strategic building of Web-accessible
        resources, including curated clusters of prepackaged content, access
        to greater portions of institutions&rsquo; holdings, and more diverse
        content from more institutions.</p>
    <h1>7. Conclusion (David
        Green and Rob Lancefield)</h1>
    <p>This
        paper was designed to set the stage for discussion by session participants
        of the findings and initiatives presented above, in light of experiences
        at their institutions. Insights from recent studies on the educational
        use of digital images can provide opportunities for museums to take concrete
        strategic steps to distribute digital images from their collections more
        effectively. The case studies above demonstrate something of the range
        of innovative practices now under development by individual institutions
        and collaborative initiatives to further the distribution and enhance
        the educational use of their resources. Lessons from formal evaluations
        of established programs can assist in guiding these and other new projects,
        especially in broadening, deepening, and making more functional the services
        and resources they provide. We look forward to the continuing discussion
        of how museums can more effectively create and enhance Web-based means
        of serving teaching and learning.</p>
