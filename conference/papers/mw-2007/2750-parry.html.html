				<p class="abstract">This paper reports upon the findings of a seven-month
				  project (funded by a HIRF Innovations Fellowship award) to build, demonstrate
				  and evaluate a prototype of an editable, wireless, in-gallery digital label
				  system that uses a Web-based authoring tool. The partnership between the
				  University of Leicester and Simulacra worked with three UK museums to test
				  the viability of building and sustaining such a system. The paper places
				  the use of such dynamic 'labelling' in the longer historical context of
				  museum interpretation and the relationship between museums' on-site and
				  on-line channels. It considers the findings of both&nbsp; visitor observation
				  and the impact of different 'generators' (authors) and 'triggers' (events)
				  of the labels' live content. However, what is brought into particular relief
				  is the range of assumptions made by the curators involved &ndash; assumptions
				  with particular implications for the way both Web-based and gallery-based
				  content and interpretation were seen to be valued within the respective
				  institutions.</p>

                <h2>The Enduring Label</h2>
                <p >For some four hundred years museums have used textual
                  labels in their displays, labels that are fixed both in terms of format and
                  content. Textual commentary and interpretation on the material collections of a
                  museum (the 'emblematic approach') is entrenched in curatorial practice and
                  visitor expectation. In today&rsquo;s museums we may build (or, at least, may aspire
                  to build) multisensory experiences where digital media are intuitive and innate
                  (Parry &amp; Sawyer, 2005). One might think, therefore, that in these sorts of
                  modern gallery environments it would be unsurprising (inevitable even) for
                  there to be a downturn in the use of simple captioning and labeling of objects.
                  After all, with a range of media to be played, emitted, projected and
                  manipulated, why would a museum want to persevere with the orthodox practice of
                  displaying a short piece of text next to an object? With so many other sensory
                  channels to address, so many intelligences and learning styles to meet, so many
                  affordable media tools available, and so many creative designs to explore, what
                place could there possibly be for the humble text label?</p>
                <p >And yet, today, the text label lives. In fact, writing
                  text labels is for most museums still the orthodoxy. Reflexively,
                  curatorial practice still presupposes the existence of text
                  labels in exhibitions. Text books and seminal studies remind
                  students and curators alike of how &quot;[w]ords
                  make us think, and our thoughts conjure up pictures in our
                  minds&quot;, and how,
                  consequently, it is through the mental pictures like these
                  (which we find in a museum's text) that we &quot;discover
                  the world around us&quot; (Ekarv 1994). &quot;The
                  exhibit that tells its story successfully&quot;, McKay (1982)
                  prescribes, &quot;does so through
                  the effective organization of label information and historic
                  materials.&quot;
                  Understanding the relationships of labels to one another, it
                  is said, is one of the keys to good exhibit work. Consequently,
                  when Hirschi and Screven (1996) think about the education benefits
                  visitors receive from attending a museum, it is, for them,
                  through the information contained specifically in the labels
                  that
  &quot;any true understanding of the exhibits&quot; can be gained. The principle
  that every object in an exhibit should have some form of identification appears
  to be engrained in best practice and embedded in curatorial culture; &quot;[i]f
  it is important enough to show the public,&quot; so the thinking goes, &quot;it's
  important enough to have a label&quot; (DeRoux 1998a).</p>
                <p >Indeed, many museums remain uncomfortable at the idea of
                  displaying objects without labels. It was this assumption, after all, that
                  helped define the Henry Moore Institute&rsquo;s exhibition in 2001-2002,
  &lsquo;Unidentified Museum Objects: Curiosities from the British Museum&rsquo; (<a href="../http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/</a>).
                  Curators James Putnam and Stephen Feeke filled the small space of &lsquo;Gallery 4&rsquo;
                  at the institute (in Leeds, UK) with a number of British Museum collection
                  objects (&lsquo;UMOs&rsquo;) that had evaded classification and whose function and
                  provenance was shrouded by doubt. However, it was the capricious absence of
                  text labels (and, consequently, the un-tethering of meaning and the removal of
                  the voice of the authoritative museum) that served mischievously to unsettle
                  and provoke the visitor. The curatorial joke, the intellectual exercise, could
                  only work if text labels were understood &ndash; by museum and visitor alike &ndash; to be
                  essential parts of what an exhibition should be. The &lsquo;missing&rsquo; labels, therefore,
                  brought not just the objects, but also the whole idea of an exhibition into
                question.</p>
                <p >Even in the hypermedia moment, the emblematic coupling of
                  text-and-image, text-and-object, has been resilient. At times, the frames of
                  reference for building digital content in museums are  defined by the
                  established practice of &lsquo;label writing&rsquo;. In the case of Katz et
                  al. (2006), aspects of the presentation of mobile multimedia are likened to
  &quot;the titles of written labels&quot;, and the mobile text itself functions &quot;like interpretive
                  labels&quot;. Similarly, Speroni et al. (2006) have argued
                  eloquently on how the semiotics of &lsquo;labels&rsquo; remain (sometimes
                  predictably so) part of a museum&rsquo;s design of digital interactive applications.
                  And, certainly, if we turn to an example such as the targeting and depth of
                  information provided by the &lsquo;Smart Web Exhibit&rsquo; (by the Carnegie Mellon
                  University Libraries, the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon
                  University and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History), we see at play perhaps
                  an augmentation (rather than jettisoning) of the traditional label. For the
                  curatorial approach here is still essentially emblematic (Bernadette &amp;
                  Thibadeau, 2000). Object labeling remains present in the habits of thumbnailing
                  that characterize our presentation of on-line catalogues (Trant et al., 2000),
                  the textual descriptions that structure our digital resources (Addis, Martinez
                  and Lewis, 2005), the metadata that encodes our on-line image databases (Bennet
  &amp; Jones, 2001), and the alternative text that tags our accessible
  &lsquo;captioned images&rsquo; (Bowen et al, 2001). Even the current phenomenon of social
                  tagging in the context of museum collections is described by its leading
                  exponents (Wyman et al., 2006) as a form of &lsquo;labelling&rsquo;.
                  Evidently, formats may change, interfaces may vary,
                  content may be more dynamic, but in each of these cases the culture of the
                museum &lsquo;label&rsquo; is sustained.</p>
                <h3>Origins</h3>
                <p >There are (at least) two cultural streams
                  that flow into the emergence of the museum label in the European tradition: the
                  culture of the <em>emblem</em>, and the culture of <em>classifying</em>. One
                  tradition is from the world of pageantry, poetics and display; the other from
                the world of natural philosophy and cataloguing. </p>
                <p >In terms of the former, it is with reference to
                  Valeriano&rsquo;s <em>Hieroglyphica</em> that D. J. Gordon (see Orgel, 1980) helps us
                  to understand a European Renaissance moment where text and image became
                  conjoined within (and to) museum culture. Through emblems and <em>impresa</em>,
                  in the sixteenth century a &quot;combination of picture and motto or legend&quot; (Orgel
                  1980: 16) was fuelled by a great vogue for hieroglyphs. Although the meaning of
                  these emblems was at times deliberately &quot;elitist, abstruse, exclusive&quot; (Orgel
                  1980: 18), the goal was both to convey and embody a &quot;hidden wisdom&quot;. For the
                  Elizabethans, Gordon explains, there was &quot;an area of ambiguity, powerful in its
                  application, about the relationship between name and thing, representation and
                  object &ndash; even name and person&quot; (Orgel 1980: 21). Therefore, the early museums&rsquo;
                  and cabinets&rsquo; use of an <em>emblematic</em> presentation of images and objects
                  (with interpretive and instructive text) would have been recognisable within
                  (and consistent with) the rest of the cultural landscape of the late
                  Renaissance and Baroque in Europe &ndash; a landscape where this marriage of image/object
                  with text was understood to be an act of eloquence and wisdom. Crucially, the
                  place we would recognise today as &lsquo;museum&rsquo; comes into focus for the modern eye
                  at just this time; consequently, it is unsurprising to find an emblematic
                tradition at the core of the museum&rsquo;s modus operandi &ndash; both then and today.</p>
                <p >However, flowing into this early modern impulse to caption
                  image with text came another discourse &ndash; more systematic, but just as complex
                  and just as laden in meaning. Just as the magic, resemblances, interpretations
                  and dualities of the medieval and Renaissance worlds became outmoded (at least
                  for those individuals influencing political and intellectual life) by the
                  reason and systematic rigour of new scientific projects of measurement and order,
                  so also the museum became a place of &quot;overarching explanatory narratives&quot;
                  (Pearce, 1995: 371), where &quot;the establishment of records, of filing systems for
                  them, the drawing up of catalogues, indexes, and inventories, worked as a way
                  of introducing an order between all things&quot; (Hooper-Greenhill, 1992: 137).
                  Crucially, it was from this moment (at the end of the seventeenth century) that
                  museums such as the Aldrovandi in Bologna and the Plater
                  museum in Basle were among the first institutions to incorporate text labels
                  into their exhibitions (Murray, 1904). Here, their text labels became an
                  embodiment of this &quot;classified time&quot; (Hooper-Greenhill, 1992: 137) and the
                  instructive agenda that the Enlightenment museum held at its core. A museum had
                a collection, but giving order and meaning to this collection were its labels.</p>
                <h3>Practice</h3>
                <p >With this rich heritage behind it, and with exhibition
                  texts understood (by some) to be a &quot;central component of a museum&rsquo;s
                  communication agenda&quot; (Ravelli, 2006: 3), practitioners today continue to
                  reflect upon the form, function and content of labels. Analysis has varied from
                  practical approaches on use of tone and style (Kentley &amp; Negus 1989) to
                  more empirical measuring and testing of text label legibility and readability.
                  Equally, the conception of label text has varied from approaches that have
                  advocated &lsquo;concrete&rsquo; structures and condensed writing, to others that have
                  emphasized the importance of rhythm in the construction of gallery text: &quot;you
                  can concentrate text&quot;, says Ekarv (1994), &quot;to an almost poetic level.&quot;
                  Guidelines on writing text labels have at times been prescriptive (McKay, 1982;
                  DeRoux 1998a), stipulating typeface size and style, line length, leading,
                  avoidance of overprinting, one idea or natural phrase per line, use of active
                  verbs, avoidance of subordinate clauses, and so on (Gilmore &amp; Sabine 1994);
                  whereas at other times, less regulatory, critical linguistic analysis has been
                applied (Coxall, 1991).</p>
                <p >Unsurprisingly, however, the text label has not remained
                  insulated from modern museological criticism. Whereas a writer
                  like Coxall might fear how a curator&rsquo;s text on a label
                  might unconsciously perpetuate a stereotype or myth through
                  its choice of language, Gurian&rsquo;s concern instead is
                  rather for the myth of the text label itself (as medium) &ndash; and
                  the assumptions it makes about visitor experience and learning.
                  For Gurian (1991), the perpetuity of the text label in the
                  modern museum is symptomatic of more lasting, and what she
                  sees as more worrying, curatorial suppositions about the needs
                  of a &lsquo;civilised person&rsquo; within an exhibition.</p>
                <p >And so it is that the modest text label (at least in its
                  traditional, printed, static form, authored and given context by the museum)
                  remains: both iconic of what a museum is, and a symbol of what a museum should
                strive not to be.</p>
                <h2>From &lsquo;Label&rsquo; to &lsquo;LIVE!Label&rsquo;</h2>
                <p >Encouragingly, however, DeRoux (1998b) reminds us that
  &quot;museum label-making techniques change and evolve with the times, and with new
                technology.&quot;</p>
                <p >So, rather than sweeping labels aside (as Gurian and
                  perhaps some of our new digital plans have envisaged), what
                  if we acknowledged (and preserved) the embedded and informed
                  practices of label writing and the intrinsic and historic part
                  that labels play in the imagining and building of exhibitions &ndash; but,
                  at the same time, also explored the implications of simply
                  making the labels <em>digital</em>? Rather than using the full
                  functionality of digital media (the reflex temptation whenever
                  computers are introduced to the gallery floor), what if the
                  label were not a touchscreen, and not the tip of a multimedia
                  iceberg of archival material, but simply and cleanly <em>just
                  a label</em> &ndash; but a label (crucially) that could be
                  updated by the curator (or perhaps even the visitor) locally
                  or remotely via the Web? What if the label the visitor looked
                  at (at first glance, the same as any other) were in fact 'broadcasting'
                  the very latest interpretations of its object? What if the
                  labels in that exhibit could change (like some of our Web sites)
                  at particular times of the day, or in response to certain planned
                  or unplanned events? What if the labels in the exhibit could
                  be changed, as easily as changing the stylesheet of a Web site,
                  to tune its content to the needs of a particular visiting group,
                  moment, or occasion? ('The exhibit this week is curated by
                  ...'; 'Here are the labels your school class sent to us ...',
                  'Why not try our lunchtime trail ...') What happens, in short,
                  when the new editorial practices of on-line publishing developed
                  by museums over the last ten years are allowed to reflect back
                  on to the on-site exhibit?</p>
                <p >This has been the premise of the <strong>LIVE!Labels</strong> (L!Ls)
                  project &ndash; a collaboration between the Digital Heritage Research Group within
                  the University of Leicester&rsquo;s Department of Museum Studies and Simulacra, a
                  specialist producer of technology-enabled learning resources and tools for the
                museum and education sectors.</p>
                <h3>Objectives And Principles</h3>
                <p >The objective of the project was to design and then test a
                  prototype of L!Ls. Research into existing practice and consultation with
                  practitioners (including a day-long &lsquo;concept workshop&rsquo; attended by a range of
                  museum practitioners and representatives from the collaborating organizations)
                helped to determine a series of design principles. L!Ls needed to</p>
                <ul>
  <li>
    easily reconfigure labeling layouts; </li>
  
<li>
  accept changes in display media; </li>
  
<li>
  limit the impact on existing IT installations; </li>
  
<li>
  allow for remote updating - for large or distributed sites; </li>
  
<li>
  support the automatic/timed updating of labels; </li>
  
<li>
  easily integrate user-generated content via phones, hand-helds,
  or Web sites; </li>
  
<li>
  easily integrate third party content such as RSS feeds; and
  (ultimately) </li>
  
<li>
  offer a museum reduced costs over printed labels. </li>
                </ul>
                <p >With regard to the last of these points, other sectors &ndash;
                  specifically retailing &ndash; have begun to use TFT-LCD solutions
                  for small digital signage (<a href="../http://www.profimax.it/" target="_blank">http://www.profimax.it/</a>;
                  <a href="../http://www.digitalview.com/" target="_blank">http://www.digitalview.com/</a>),
                  although plasma and projection are other common approaches
                  (see <a href="../http://www.commandaustralia.com/" target="_blank">http://www.commandaustralia.com</a>),
                  as are interactive touch screen window displays (see <a
href="../http://www.totalmediamarketing.net/" target="_blank">http://www.totalmediamarketing.net/</a>).
                  The collaborators believe that hardware costs will continue
                  to fall, and that alternatives to TFT-LCD technology are emerging: &lsquo;electronic
                  paper&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;e-paper&rsquo; (see <a
href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper</a>)
                is one such example.</p>
                <p >Front-end evaluation and market research also revealed the
                following: </p>
                <ol>
  <li>
   L!Ls needed, wherever possible, to build upon existing curatorial
    practice. The challenge for curators (especially in an accountable era where
    public funded museums, in the UK at least, are under great pressure with
    limited resources to demonstrate their &lsquo;value&rsquo;) is to continue to build
    exhibits that are relevant, fresh, inclusive and engaging. Introducing a tool
    or technology that disrupted or was incongruous to established practice was
    thought, therefore, to be undesirable &ndash; however innovative that technology
    might be.</li>
  
<li>
  L!Ls needed to provide a solution that was powerful but &lsquo;polite&rsquo;.
  Historically, when digital media have been used within a gallery setting, the
  format has invariably been  multimedia interactives: games, simulations, Web
  terminals and searchable databases, frequently contained in &lsquo;kiosks&rsquo; and
  installations that are at best discrete from (and at worst incongruous to)
  their gallery settings. The museum sector is keen to utilize the power of
  digital media but in a fashion that is sympathetic to (and ambient with) the unique
  environment of the gallery setting, and in a way that does not distance and
  over-mediate the object on display or alienate less computer-literate segments
  of the visiting public.</li>
  
<li>
  L!Ls needed to exploit the growing resource of the on-line
  museum, as well the <em>convergence</em> between the on-line and on-site
  channels. As more and more museums realign their missions and
  strategies to embed digital media activity and provision into their core
  functions, and as more museums become immersed in the promise of the digital
  age, there is as much talk of &lsquo;broadcast&rsquo; as there is about &lsquo;outreach&rsquo;,
  of
  &lsquo;channel&rsquo; as about &lsquo;exhibition&rsquo;, and of &lsquo;user&rsquo; as
  about &lsquo;visitor&rsquo;. Curatorial
  resource is being invested into developing day-to-day new interpretive content
  for museum Web sites. L!Ls (in some respects an object&rsquo;s own updateable
  Web page that sits next to it in the gallery) are one way this productivity
  can begin to have an effect not just on the on-line, but the on-site museum
  as well.</li>
                </ol>
                <p >A matrix of different &lsquo;triggers&rsquo; (<em>events</em>) and
  &lsquo;generators&rsquo; (<em>authors</em>) was formed to capture and to begin to
                  rationalize the myriad ways that L!Ls could be used. Content may be <em>generated</em>
                  by curators, visitors (submitted on-site or on-line) or by an approved third
                  party. The uploading of this content to the label would then be time-driven
                  (triggered to the time of day/week); or visit-driven (triggered by the type of
                  visitor); or event-driven (triggered in response to a planned event, programme
                  or &lsquo;guest curation&rsquo;); or news-driven (responding to unplanned events or new
                research).</p>
                <p>Across this grid of &lsquo;triggers&rsquo; and &lsquo;generators&rsquo; content was
                likely to be in four key forms:</p>
                <ol>
  <li>
  <em>contextual</em> &ndash; using the label&rsquo;s editable quality to provide new
    or changing interpretations of the object (&lsquo;This week scientists discovered
    that objects like this are …&rsquo;); or</li>
  
<li>
  <em>promotional</em> &ndash; using the label&rsquo;s editable quality to bring to
  the visitor&rsquo;s attention other events or services provided by the museum (&lsquo;To
  find out more about this object why not go and see the next showing of …&rsquo;); or</li>
  
<li>
  <em>directional</em> &ndash; using the label&rsquo;s editable quality to highlight
  connections to other objects and displays in the museum&rsquo;s changing provision,
  or to build a thematic &lsquo;trail&rsquo; (&lsquo;Another one of these objects is currently now
  on display in the …&rsquo;); or</li>
  
<li>
  <em>responsive</em> &ndash; using the label&rsquo;s editable quality to allow a
  voice for visitors in the gallery (&lsquo;A 10-year-old visitor who saw this object
  yesterday said it reminded them of …&rsquo;).</li>
                </ol>
                <p >To provide the best possible initial glimpse of the
                  potential and functionality of L!Ls, it was agreed that the testing and
                  evaluation of the prototype would ideally be distributed across a combination
                of these generators, triggers and forms.</p>
                <h3>The Trial</h3>
                <p >Over a seven-month period during 2006, the collaborators
                  worked to build, demonstrate and evaluate a prototype of an editable, wireless,
                  in-gallery digital label system that used a Web-based authoring tool. To
                  deliver this concept &ndash; of a gallery label which can be remotely updated &ndash; the
                  collaborators built a number of slim LCD &lsquo;labels&rsquo; (in two sizes: 6.4 inches
                  diagonal; and 10.4 inches diagonal) with in-built wireless capability, that
                  connected to a simple Web-based Content Administration System.&nbsp;This
                  administration system enabled curators to author label text, select font and
                  background colours or images, and set the times at which specific labels would
                  be shown.&nbsp;Content was then sent via the Internet and a wireless connection
                to each of the L!Ls.</p>

                  Gallery, July-August 2006, New Walk Museum and Art Gallery, Leicester (photo:
                R. Parry).</p>
                <p >L!Ls were installed in three galleries, at two different
                  institutions, in a period of testing than ran in total for
                  nine weeks. The galleries were chosen to present a range of
                  subject disciplines (art; natural history; and science/technology),
                  but also a range of typical gallery environments (&lsquo;white
                  cube&rsquo;; cabinet and pedestal gallery; highly immersive
                  discovery space). Significantly, the partner museums were also
                  chosen for their differences in institutional organization
                  and governance: New Walk Museum and Art Gallery (Leicester)
                  is a local authority museum run and resourced via a city museums
                  service; the National Space Centre (Leicester) is a not-for-profit
                  charity; and the Natural History Museum, in London (that provided
                  on-going consultation through the project) is a national museum
                  funded directly from the central UK government.</p>
                <p >In the German Expressionist exhibit at New Walk Museum and
                  Art Gallery, the senior curator of art was able to use the
                  labels as a way of capturing his latest thoughts and observations
                  on the works on display.&nbsp;Under the title of <strong>Curator's
                  Eye</strong> the LIVE!Labels sat
                  alongside the permanent catalogue and labels, and over three
                  weeks were approached, effectively, as an in-gallery blog for
                  two of the paintings: &quot;I
                  looked at this picture again today, and it reminded me of something
                  I saw last week when ...&quot;&nbsp; Updated labels were dated
                  and the curator&rsquo;s name was
                given.</p>
                <p >In the Dinosaur Gallery at the same institution, another
                  member of the curatorial staff invited younger visitors to 'Be a Dinosaur
                  Curator for a day'. Over a three-week period visitors could write on a postcard
                  what they wanted to see on the LIVE!Labels around the main dinosaur exhibit. The
                  curator could then e-mail them to say that their label had been chosen to be on
                  display in the gallery - they would be the 'curator for the day'.&nbsp;The
                  Web-based L!L authoring system, linked to the wireless labels, made it
                  relatively straightforward for the curator to embed visitor-generated content
                into the exhibit.</p>
                <p >At the National Space Centre (NSC), Leicester, Head of
                  Space Communication Kevin Yates used the LIVE!Labels to give visitors the very
                  latest information (updated daily over a three-week period) on the number of
                  Near Earth Objects (NEOs) in space &ndash; and how many of them (that day) were
                  classified as 'hazardous'.&nbsp;This was data that the NSC was already
                  recording each day, but was not making available to visitors in the NEO
                  exhibit. During the trial, Kevin was even able to update the label in his
                exhibit from his home, via the Web, one Saturday morning.</p>
                <h3>Evaluation and Results</h3>
                <p >Before and after the trial, curators were interviewed on
                  their expectations of and reflections on  the L!Ls (both hardware and software).
                  They were also observed while using the system, and were encouraged to use a
  &lsquo;diary&rsquo; to record instances when the labels were changed, along with any other
                  observations. Furthermore, across a 20-day period 763 visitors were observed
                  (and interaction with the L!Ls coded) in the three gallery locations. From this
                  observed group, 149 visitors were interviewed. (The visitor observation and
                  interviews were circumscribed to a non-probability sampling and in consequence
                  its results should not be considered representative of the potential population
                  of the three museums that participated in this study. The feedback obtained
                from the visitors relied on the availability of the subjects.)</p>
                <p >Half of the 763 visitors did not look at the labels. Only
                  around 20% of the total number of visitors to the galleries
                  actually read the labels. And of this group, only around 1
                  in 5 visitors saw them as in some way 'live'. Very few visitors
                  noticed that the labels were dated. For about three-quarters
                  of visitors who did read the labels, they made no change or
                  made a positive change on their experience. Only one visitor
                  out of the 149 who read the L!Ls thought they changed their
                  experience in a negative way. And only two visitors out of
                  this same group saw them as a 'distraction'.</p>
                <p >Around a third of visitors touched the L!Ls. Visitors at
                  the NSC, a vivid and, at times, loud &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; space
                  with a number of other digital and non-digital in-gallery interactives,
                   were much more expectant of interactivity compared
                  to visitors at the German Expressionist gallery at New Walk:
                  at the NSC, visitors were seven times more likely to touch
                  the screen. In contrast, visitors were more likely to describe
                  the labels as 'digital' or 'different' in the German Expressionist
                  gallery, than at the NSC.</p>
                <p >Although there is abundant evidence (at this early stage)
                  to suggest that the L!L prototypes are not distracting nor out of place in the
                  gallery (rather, in the majority of cases a positive addition to the exhibition
                  space) there is, nevertheless, an equal amount of evidence to suggest that
                  visitors do not notice that the labels (at least as they were used in the
                  trial)  contain potentially 'live' information. And yet, around a quarter of
                  visitors commented positively upon the informational role of the L!Ls. In fact,
                  when asked, most visitors commented upon the content and clarity of the
                information rather than its 'liveness'.</p>
                <h2>Questions</h2>
                <p >Of course, another layer of interpretation and an
                  important factor to keep in mind is the extent to which we are seeing, in this
                  evaluation data, visitors' reactions to the <em>physicality</em> of the L!L, or
                  the <em>concept</em> of the L!L, or the <em>content</em> that each curator
                  chose to put on the label. As the L!L research continues over the coming
                year it is hoped to draw out these respective strands of analysis.</p>
                <p >The second area that the collaborating organizations are
                  hoping to explore further relates to the different responses of the curators
                  involved. The curator interviews, and the observations of the curators using
                  the system, revealed a reticence about updating new/live content to the
                  galleries. Significantly, this reticence varied across the disciplines the
                  curators were working within, the style of gallery, and the type of
                  organization. Further research will attempt to determine which of these (or
                others) was the determining factor.</p>
                <p >L!Ls appear to bring into focus a series of questions
                  about narrative, text, and authorship in a gallery context. The consultation
                  and front-end evaluation undertaken to develop the design specification of the
                  prototype and the results of the live testing both strongly indicated the
                following: </p>
                <ol>
  <li>
    that curators are not explicitly claiming authorship and ownership of
    their textual content in exhibitions; </li>
  
<li>
  that (perhaps in an attempt to speak to myriad learning styles,
  intelligences, experiences, knowledge levels and modes of visiting) there is a
  reticence over using a single, consistent curatorial voice; and </li>
  
<li>
  that many museums have still to resolve how authorship, authority and
  narrativity function in a hypermedia context. </li>
                </ol>
                <p >It is here perhaps that we should remember Walsh&rsquo;s (1997)
                comments on the writing of text labels in exhibitions:</p>
                <p class="BlockQuote">The typical interpretive art museum label, for example, is
                  the work of a committee of educators, editors, scholars, and administrators who
                  not infrequently disagree. Even the simple line &quot;attributed to&quot; can,
                  in a museum label, conceal fierce behind-the-scenes debates over the nature of
                the art object it purports to describe.</p>
                <p >Unlike the committee-work and conflict Walsh describes, it
                  has been assumed (mistakenly perhaps) with this first iteration of L!Ls that
                  curators can potentially change their in-gallery content with the same speed,
                  frequency and confidence as they appear to have when updating their on-line Web
                  content. Actually (from the perspective of this research at least), it appears
                  that curators view their in-gallery and on-line content differently. One
                  unintended outcome of this first phase of research and development into L!Ls
                  (and something the collaborators are keen to pursue further) has been the
                  revelation of this disparity between on-line provision that is thought to be
                  active and responsive, and on-site (in-gallery) provision that is perceived to
                be largely and traditionally rigid, unmoved by events and visitors. </p>
                <p >A decade ago, when many museums began their first attempts
                  at building Web sites, the information architectures of these new on-line
                  spaces invariably aped the physical and institutional architectures of the
                  on-site space. And yet, in time, on-line museums increasingly found their own
                  (distinctive) shape and voice, rescripting the notion of 'visit' (Parry &amp;
                  Arbach, 2005), recalibrating the criteria of what makes an 'authentic' object
                  (Miller, 2002; Lynch, 2000), and extending the channels through which a museum
                  can build a relationship with its widening audience (Rellie, 2004). Informed
                  ever more, it seems, by the worlds of publishing and broadcast (Pratty, 2006),
                  museums active in this area have assembled new workflows to ensure their sites
                are relevant, fresh and live.</p>
                <p >The irony glimpsed within this first phase research and
                  development of LIVE!Labels is that perhaps the time has come for the gallery to
                begin to learn from the Web, for the on-site finally to learn from the on-line.</p>
