    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The aim of MORITZ is to develop a concept for tours
      at industrial heritage sites in Europe. To extend the museum exhibitions
      into industrial sites, we are developing PDA applications which allow visitors
      to explore historical sites, interact with monuments of industrial heritage
      and receive multimedia content directly at the site. </p>
    <p>In 2006, the &lsquo;Culture
        2000&rsquo; program sponsored by the European Union approved our project
        MORITZ (Mobile Tour in European Textile Industry Centers). The project
        is based on collaboration between textile industry museums and universities
        across Europe. Thus far, there are five museums participating as active
        and passive partners, including Nordwolle in Delmenhorst (Germany), the
        Central Museum of Textiles in Lodz (Poland), the Museum of Decorative
        Arts and Design in Riga (Latvia), the Textile Museum in Bocholt (Germany),
        and The Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester (England), with
        three counterpart universities: the University of Applied Sciences, Bremen,
        Germany, the University of Applied Sciences in Gelsenkirchen, Germany,
        and the Technical University, Riga, Latvia.</p>
    <p>Within this environment
        we have a unique opportunity to explore the possibilities of mobile tours
        as part of international museum networks. As our guides and inspiration
        on this journey, two larger networks have to be mentioned. The European
        Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH), with nearly 60 anchor points in
        cities and towns spanning across Europe, from Germany over the Benelux
        to England, covers multiple aspects of European industrialization (<a href="../http://www.erih.net/" target="_blank">http://www.erih.net/</a>).
        The European Textile Network operates &ldquo;a database, containing circa
        4,500 address details from about 80 countries and some 1,000 annual event
        previews, that has been created in co-operation with the ETN Association
        and Textile Forum Service (tfs).&rdquo; (<a href="../http://www.etn-net.org/" target="_blank">http://www.etn-net.org</a>).
        Also, while we are developing &lsquo;only&rsquo; three tours in Germany,
        Poland and Latvia, the concept is to produce a solution that is highly
        adaptable to other institutions in the cultural heritage sector. The
        innovation lies in the development of a conceptual and technical approach
        that is transferable to different sites within an existing European network
        of textile industry. MORITZ<strong> </strong>(Mobile
        Tour in European Textile Industry Centers) is a project of mobile2culture
        within the ZIMT center at the University of Applied Sciences in Bremen,
        Germany (<a href="../http://www.mobile2culture.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mobile2culture.com</a> ).</p>
    <h1>What Are The Similarities And
        Characteristics of the Sites?</h1>
    <p>Developing a mobile tour
        application for multiple institutions means that you have to determine
        the similarities and characteristics of each cultural heritage site.
        This process begins with the organization of the cultural heritage sites
        themselves. The site in Delmenhorst, Germany, is a small town with an
        impressive industrial heritage, the Nordwolle. The Lahusen family commissioned
        architect Henrich Deetjen to build the factory in 1884, but the company
        already had a 70-year-old tradition in trade. Today, the site has been
        transformed into a multifunctional, mixed-use environment with two museums
        (one for the factory and one for the town itself), and an existing tour
        with signs throughout the factory area. The factory area is a &ldquo;town
        within a town. This means that we have a special situation of logistical
        integration: the site of industrial culture is connected to a thriving
        city.</p>
    <p>The Museum of Decorative
        Applied Arts in Riga, Latvia, is located in a 13<sup>th</sup> century
        church; it also holds a textile triennial. As a town known for its big
        harbor and small textile crafts, the museum focuses on textile art from
        Latvia. The cultural heritage is not so much industrial, as it is focused
        on Latvia&rsquo;s rich textile traditions. Riga itself is a tourist attraction
        of international dimensions. </p>
    <p>The businessman Ludwik Geyer
        had the &ldquo;White Factory&rdquo; built in Lodz from 1835-1838, from
        English plans. The factory was the first mechanical textile mill in Lodz,
        and later, also had the town&rsquo;s first chimney as well. While Lodz
        began as a small town, it grew very quickly in the first half of the
        19<sup>th</sup> century. Today, it carries the title of the &ldquo;Manchester
        of Eastern Europe&rdquo;. Until the collapse of the iron curtain, Lodz
        was a center for the textile industry, and it is now going through dramatic
        changes. Other textile mills surround the &ldquo;White Factory&rdquo;,
        and Lodz itself can be seen as a site of cultural heritage. With funds
        from both the European Union and the town itself, the &ldquo;White Factory&rdquo; is
        presently building an extension for its textile art collection and is
        in the process of relocating heritage buildings, six wooden workers houses,
        a church and a representative house, to the grounds of the factory. The
        museum has also held a textile triennial for over 20 years.</p>
    <p>The overall area we are
        working in is industrial heritage: the textile industry in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.
        As each museum is unique, only common aspects can intersect. In our case,
        what the museums have in common is that they display textile design,
        craftsmanship and historical objects. They are divided into indoor and
        out-door sections. They combine aspects of industrialization and art.
        They also share dimensions of European history in areas of worker migrations
        and the social living conditions of the workers at the beginning of European
        industrialization. Lastly, the factories are examples of early industrial
        architecture. Thus, we can connect three very different cultural heritage
        locations with a common focus on textile production &ndash; a perfect
        opportunity to develop a highly transferable tour concept.</p>
    <h2>Why Mobile Media?</h2>
    <p>To extend the museum exhibitions into the industrial
      sites, we need PDA applications&nbsp; that allow&nbsp; visitors to explore
      historical sites, interact with monuments of industrial heritage, and receive
      multimedia content directly at the site. </p>
    <p>The software we use is called TURI. It is an easy to
      use, Java-based, platform independent authoring tool used within the EU
      project IMKA (Innovative Ma&szlig;nahmen Kultur der Arbeit, a project headed
      by the chief of our research group, Prof. Eirund), with the aim of providing
      a toolbox to make tourist information accessible on-sites of industrial
      culture, in order to frame the specifics of a product-identity of European
      wide industrial tourism. </p>
    <p>The objectives of ERIH are to raise awareness about
      the &ldquo;identity and knowledge for the conservation and protection of
      industrial heritage sites&rdquo;, &ldquo;to emphasize trans-national aspects
      of the European Industrial Heritage&rdquo; and to establish and expand
      a European network <a href="../http://www.erih.net/" target="_blank">(http://www.erih.net/</a>). The
      PDA tour aims to pool content-oriented and event-oriented strategies and
      convey industrial cultural heritage. Fun and enjoyment are as important
      for learning as the impact of deeper, historical contexts. </p>
    <p>By crossing the barriers of time and space, the mobile
      medium delivers insights into the past of industrial sights &ndash; using
      historical views of the industrial settings, images of people who have
      worked in these settings, and accompanying explanations and reports referring
      to contemporary witnesses and characterizing the commonality with other
      places.</p>
    <p>With interactive graphics you can open doors, look through
      walls, animate old machines or time lapses. In Delmenhorst one feature
      divides a water tower, explaining the three tanks with their different
      water qualities, environmental conservation and cost cutting; this is an
      autonomous water system in an industrial area over 100 years old. </p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 1: Screenshots from the PDA application (Design
      by Daniela Ratt and Janine Dubslaff)</p>
    <p>From a pedagogical point of view, the visitor is able
      to interact not only with the graphic, but also with the building on-site.
      The first interaction takes place when visitors arrive at the place of
      interest; only there can they activate the PDA content via a code which
      they have to enter. The code is placed on a sign next to the point of interest.
      If the object is in an urban environment one has to consider where to put
      the sign, avoiding problems with authority, but also providing information
      about the museum and the production company. Since they are on-site, visitors
      can be given tasks like investigating the building (counting architectural
      elements, finding views of the building on the next site, finding information
      on the back side, etc.). At the next level of interaction,&nbsp; visitors
      receive information going back in time and in relation to other places.
      Finally, the building can be virtually destructed or unfolded to explain
      its former function.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="kluetsch_fig8.jpg" alt="Fig 2: PDA in use" width="148" height="200" /><img src="kluetsch_fig9.png" alt="Fig 2: PDA in use" width="200" height="200" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2: PDA in use</p>
    <p>The experience is framed by an authentic setting that
      creates a unique situation. The dissemination of the museum information
      at the current site of industrial heritage through a mobile device is a
      key factor in our approach. We know from other projects (e.g. Eirund; Schreiber
      1998) that visitors like to search and retrieve multimedia information.
      If all members of a small group have the opportunity to search for 'hidden'
      aspects, like doors, shortcuts, signs etc., the typical stereotypes of
      group behaviours are rejected and a communicative situation with flat hierarchies
      is created. For instance, if children and parents look for the same things,
      the difference in knowledge is not significant any more. This motivates
      each participant in the tour (and the search) and builds up a dramaturgical
      tension.</p>
    <p>An outdoor mobile tour has to weigh the relation between
      the points of information and the time needed to walk the tour. To be of
      maximum benefit to the visitor, the information has to be concentrated
      and bundled (Najjar 1996). Multiple aspects have to be addressed, focused
      under a theme of the tour, related to other places and times. Our approach
      in the production of the on-site mobile tours is to see it from the visitors&rsquo; perspective.
      The central questions are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the target audience? </li>
      <li>How much time do they spend on the tour? </li>
      <li>What are their technical skills? </li>
      <li>How long are they willing to walk? </li>
      <li>How much information can you gather in the defined
        time? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our tour is based on&nbsp; the following assumptions: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>visitors come alone or in a small group, </li>
      <li>they want to spent 45-90 min, </li>
      <li>they have basic technical skills (they can use
        the Internet), </li>
      <li>they do not want to walk more than 3 miles, and
        therefore, </li>
      <li>they spend about 20 min with the mobile device. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>From these basic assumptions, you get a feeling of how
      much information you can place on a handheld device. The overall tour should
      follow a clear dramaturgy. It is important to avoid empty phases. The visitors
      should have the chance to choose what they want to see, but also should
      be guided through the area and the content of the PDA; they&nbsp; are probably
      on their first and last time at the museum, and don't want to learn unnecessary
      information like how to navigate the PDA or memorize a complex map. Instead,
      the PDA should guide intuitively and seamlessly through the areas, offering
      different levels of informational depth. The PDA should offer background
      information, entertainment, participatory content, graphical explanations,
      facts, and contemporary usage and/or historical developments.</p>
    <h2>Our Development Process</h2>
    <p>Thus, the production of a multimedia storyline asks
      for a high level of conceptual work, coordination of different sites, and
      awareness of technical constraints. At the same time, the storyline has
      to be open to new information, and able to cross-reference time, space
      and geographical connections. As the project focuses on industrial heritage,
      the central aspect should be the workers, their working conditions, immigration
      backgrounds, and the social dimension. Originally, exhibitions had to focus
      on objects that are contextualized by text displays. A mobile PDA application
      can use the latest developments in multimedia, and demand a new museum
      pedagogical approach. The concept turns from displaying information to
      requiring active exploration by the visitor, supported by powerful media
      tools and linked to the knowledge of distant sites.</p>
    <p>For the conception of a storyline, it is necessary to
      start with a synopsis recording all relevant information to get an overview
      of the tour. Most likely you will realize that you already have too much
      in mind. Our format is shown in Table 1.</p>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="caption">Table 1: Overview of the content of a tour </p>
    <p>The next step is to adapt the synopsis to the technical
      restraints and the concept of the navigation on the PDA. First, it is important
      to decide how to solve the problem of geographical tracking. A good overview
      of the wireless solution within museum contexts is available in Proctor
      2005 and Colazzo et al 2005. After close investigation of the technical
      options of wireless networks, we decided to go back to a very traditional
      but secure technique: entering a code that the visitor has to locate at
      the point of interest. If you need to locate the position of a visitor
      in a large outdoor area, this is the only reliable option today: GPRS has
      shadows of buildings; infrared depends on the direction the visitor points
      the PDA; Bluetooth has a range of only about 10 meters; all require the
      presence of a network in an urban environment. Hopefully, we can use a
      true network technique in our next project. As of yet, we don't have a
      solution for offering database information onsite. The compromise is to
      upload information to the PDA before the tours starts. We don&rsquo;t&rsquo; ask
      either the visitor or the developer for detailed technical knowledge. We
      decided to develop an easy, transferable method of content presentation.
      Our software TURI was designed to enable multimedia specialists to develop
      a tour without having to write a single line of code. It all depends on
      the synopsis which has to be filled in by museum content specialists. Thus,
      we have a tool that is extremely flexible, highly adaptable, easy to use
      for everybody.</p>
    <h2>Perspective</h2>
    <p>Digitization allows for the exchange of content and
      digitized exhibits between institutions. The opportunity for exchange and
      transmission of content to other exhibitions expands the range of use.
      Visitors to the museum are provided with an opportunity to supplement and
      comment. Our ambition is to develop the competence of all participants
      in the project and to encourage them to anticipate future technological
      developments in their cultural thinking. They will develop the knowledge
      and ability to set up a transmittable and fully compatible European mobile
      platform for media, that can be applied in museums and sites of industrial
      culture.</p>
    <h2>Steps to Realization</h2>
    <p>We took the following steps
      during the realization of our project:</p>

      <li>During the phase of research, the first media
        concept was established in close cooperation between developers of media
        and museum historians. This concept was generated to associate the required
        data with presentation decisions and to test common cultural and didactic
        principles in free exchanges at an early stage.</li>
      <li>The outcome of the first workshop was a common
        prototypical concept. Considering the need for mobility&nbsp; and the
        cultural-historical aspects, and also the local circumstances of the
        Nordwolle museum, palm-sized computers whose touch screens and audio
        capabilities serve as surfaces of presentation and interaction were selected.</li>
      <li>A thorough examination of on-site usage, as well
        as consultation and idea exchange among all project participants regarding
        the transferrability of the concept and all aspects of industrial culture,
        directsed preparations for two further prototypes in Lodz and Riga. The
        results evolved into a development process using the shared communication
        platform.</li>
      <li>Then the prototypes were discussed by all participants
        before being returned to the individual partner organizations. In the
        second workshop the concepts of media, scripts,&nbsp; components selection and&nbsp; navigation
        were specified for implementation by the partners.</li>
      <li>The last step was detailed preparation of the
        script, digitization, and implementation of the tour on PDAs at all three
        locations.</li>
      <li>At the end of the project, a final workshop-style
        meeting of the project participants focused on further development of
        shared views of industrial history. A joint publication for European
        institutions of industrial heritage is founded.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The mobile tour developed in our project, using the
      same transferable method for all three cities, extends museum exhibitions
      through a medium that allows visitors to experience three combined aspects &ndash; manufacturing
      processes, work, and production &ndash; in original settings. These industrial
      sites are characterized by huge spaces and wide distances. The outreach
      of the museums is extended to these sites: mobile visitors with mobile
      museum media can have immediate intuitive encounters with industrial locations.
      The mobile tour delivers insights to the past on-site &ndash; through historical
      views of the settings, images and movies of people who have worked at these
      settings, accompanying explanations and reports mainly from contemporary
      witnesses, and by characterizing commonality with other places. </p>
    <h1>Future
            Research</h1>
    <p>MORITZ
      also includes aspects of participation as it is needed in the preparation
      of the following project MaX &quot;Museums at Xess&quot;. MaX combines
      the main aims of MORITZ with the idea to support the development of an
      European citizenry, by enhancing participation in cultural knowledge processes. </p>
    <p>The common
      cultural inheritance of the Europeans is the probably the most important
      basis for developing a European citizenry. A substantial Europeanizing
      of the respective national histories in terms of redeveloping the common
      European and in some cases global, point of view of early industrialization
      perhaps would not just be too expensive but also could be politically used,
      for developing resentment against Europe and a European identity by those
      wiseacres that argue with a similarity to a &quot;colonization&quot;.</p>
    <p>In addition
      to multinational companies,, the ever increasing hold of globalization
      also detracts from local structures and exerts influence on
      the emergence of individual identity. Accepting the common inheritance
      can turn this crucial process to the positive. In 10-15 years a European
      dimension will stand in the foreground, also for local history (glocal),
      as far as this will be realized over the exchange of the population of
      Europe with the experts and participants in the cultural institutions.
      Social and cultural history such as: migrations, social stories and worker
      histories, as well as textile art, industry design and design history will
      be effected by the &lsquo;knowledge society&rsquo;. To facilitate this
      process today is the goal of our project MaX. </p>
    <p>MaX is
      a project to enable citizens of the European Union to participate in cultural
      dimensions in the field of early textile industry and cultural heritage.
      It focus in its realization mainly on the promotion and generation of different
      ITC-based and non-ITC-based participation methods at the different places
      of the early textile industry culture. Aspects of transferability, evaluation,
      user observation, and user contributions will play a decisive role
      in the project.</p>
    <p>It starts
      with a competition of ideas and concepts of participation that will go
      along with the exchange of the ideas and the establishment of the best
      method at all places.</p>
    <p>The promotion
      and generation of knowledge and education processes of developing a European
      point of view on history and the participation of population in Europe
      also needs a method of common knowledge evaluation.</p>
    <p>Exchange
      for European history experts, medialization of the museums and exchange
      of the museums with the population as well as the communication between
      different populations will be affiliated in the context of participation.</p>
    <p>As visible
      output, there will be an installation of a &quot;European corner&quot; in
      the museums which presents forms and results of local and international
      interactions (e.g. web2.0), using trend-setting digital skills and cultural
      techniques.</p>
    <p>Visitor
      participation bases on the experience, that people today enjoy more to take active part in the
      information processes that surround them, then to consume only passively.
      The visitors need the chance to get involved, if the museum wants their
      engagement. The information transfer can get more into a common activity
      between offerers and users in active communities. The active communities
      generate information together, improve, supplement and correct them. Culture
      consumers become co-designers and will better understand and identify themselves
      with the idea behind it, which is a core goal of MaX.</p>
