				  <h1>Imagine a Different Internet</h1>
				  <p>On the surface, one might not think that microcontrollers
				    would be relevant to a conference of museum Web professionals. Microcontrollers
				    are plucky little computer chips that provide the brains for almost every
				    electronic gizmo that beeps, wiggles, or controls something, and dealing
				    with them is a far cry from the bread-and-butter activities of museum
				    digitization, education, and outreach. But looking past <em>the surface</em> for
				    a few moments is exactly what makes these little chips worth talking
				    about. </p>
				  <p>In North America and Europe, we&rsquo;re accustomed
				    to thinking about the Internet as it&rsquo;s defined by desktop computers
				    networked to big servers with complex software - so accustomed that we
				    almost never question it: that&rsquo;s just what the &lsquo;net <em>is</em>.
				    Howard Rheingold pointed out this unconscious bias in <em>Smart
				    Mobs</em> and observed that for millions
				    of people in the developing world (and also notably Japan), the Internet
				    is embodied not by personal computers but by mobile phones. In <em>When
				    Things Start to Think</em>, Neil Gershenfeld
				    mused about collapsing the boundaries between physical objects and information
				    systems, and the relatively recent ZigBee protocol exists because somebody <em>really</em> needed
				    to imagine corporeal objects forming their own quasi-Internet through
				    low-power wireless mesh-networks. It&rsquo;s all pretty strange, but
				    it points out how powerful and malleable open-standards frameworks like
				    the Internet Protocol are: who imagined 20 years ago that the same set
				    of rules created for a nuclear-attack-resistant messaging network could
				    spawn the World Wide Web and MySpace?</p>
				  <p>If I say, &ldquo;go and buy a Web server,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll
				    probably start thinking of a hardware and software investment of thousands
				    or tens &ndash;of thousands of dollars. Even if you&rsquo;re an open
				    source guru, you&rsquo;ll know you have to start limbering up to muscle
				    big, heavy, power-guzzling, beige-encased slabs of silicon and copper
				    into racks. But what if I told you that you could buy a complete Web
				    server that fits in the palm of your hand for $130 - <em>and that it&rsquo;s
				    battery powered</em>?! Both these visions
				    of what a Web server is share a set of standards, but they use wildly
				    different interpretations of those standards. The cheap palm-sized Web
				    server isn&rsquo;t a fantasy; it&rsquo;s real, mass produced, and easily
				    bought. A lot of other astonishing things are out there too, and a lot
				    more can be dreamt up by people willing to look away from common conventions.</p>

				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      1: A Web server that fits in the palm of your hand.</p>
				  <p>With increasing frequency, when someone talking
				    about &ldquo;putting something on-line&rdquo; may be talking about using
				    microprocessors to put <em>a physical thing</em> on-line
				    - not a digital surrogate (like a digital image of a work of art) - in
				    some way extending a core attribute of the thing&rsquo;s actual <em>thingness</em> on
				    to a digital information network. Maybe it&rsquo;s an alarm clock that
				    wakes you up early if the surf is good (or lets you sleep if it&rsquo;s
				    not). Maybe it&rsquo;s a piece of medical equipment that sends e-mail
				    when it needs servicing. Or maybe it&rsquo;s a scoreboard showing the
				    most popular artworks in your museum as determined by pulling information
				    from your Web site or sensing how many people are in each gallery. <em>Make</em> magazine
				    is full of these kinds of projects, and apparently the sky is the limit.&nbsp; That
				    is exactly why I&rsquo;m interested in this now.</p>
				  <p>It&rsquo;s time to throw out old assumptions and
				    innovate. The boundaries between physical and virtual erode a little
				    every day. Hackers and hobbyists are finding a common vocabulary in making
				    stuff with microprocessors. There&rsquo;s probably a Dorkbot group (<a href="../http://dorkbot.org/" target="_blank">http://dorkbot.org</a>)
				    in your city. Linux and open source thrive. Social networks, the Web
				    2.0 platform, and Long Tail markets are turning a lot of conventional
				    business models on their heads, including, perhaps, the ones that have
				    provided sanctuary to museums for the last 150 years. Where this is all
				    headed is as inconceivable as where we are now compared to 20, 10, or
				    even 5 years ago, and while it&rsquo;s true that museum professionals
				    have extremely important work to do in core digitization, documentation,
				    and elucidation, it&rsquo;s also true that we&rsquo;re a curious and
				    precocious bunch. Building things with microprocessors is a heckuva lot
				    of fun and dealing with their many surprising attributes puts one in
				    a state of mind to question and discover. And that&rsquo;s good. Let&rsquo;s
				    begin.</p>
				  <h1>What&rsquo;s a Microcontroller?</h1>
				  <p>In the rest of this paper I&rsquo;ll take beginners
				    through a high-level tour of designing and building an Internet-enabled
				    soda-vending machine. I&rsquo;m assuming my audience has only a passing
				    familiarity with hardware and software design. I won&rsquo;t present
				    all of the data or recipes needed to build the machine, but at the end
				    of this paper readers should have a pretty good idea of how to get their
				    own investigations of microcontrollers started.</p>
				  <p>First, a disclaimer. Spread your hands apart so
				    your left hand is as high in the air as possible and your right hand
				    is as low to the ground as possible. You&rsquo;ve just made a graphic
				    representation of how my knowledge of microcontrollers relates to that
				    of the experts. I&rsquo;m down where the left hand is and there are tons
				    of people whose knowledge is up where your right hand is. </p>
				  <p>Andy Lindsay in <em>What&rsquo;s a Microcontroller</em> (2003,
				      Parallax) says </p>
				  <p class="BlockQuote">A
				        microcontroller is a kind of miniature computer that
				    you can find in all kinds of gizmos&hellip;If it has buttons and a digital
				    display, chances are it also has a programmable microcontroller in it. </p>
				  <p>He
				        continues to describe the way in which digital processors
				    are teamed up with other components to constitute an &ldquo;embedded system&rdquo;,
				        commonly called a microcontroller. </p>
				  <p>The
				        microcontroller I have in front of me is called a Basic
				    Stamp and it&rsquo;s made by Parallax (<a href="../http://www.parallax.com/" target="_blank">http://www.parallax.com</a>).
				        The processor itself is tiny - about the size of a child&rsquo;s
				        fingernail. The processor has been fastened to a playing-card sized
				        plastic circuit board that connects it to a battery, a serial port
				        for hooking it up to your computer while programming and debugging
				        (and for communicating with other things that can understand serial
				        protocols), and a grid of tiny sockets that let you connect the processor&rsquo;s
				        digital signals to other electronic things, kind of like
				        an old-time telephone switchboard. This whole setup can be manufactured
				        by you for $20.00 or so, or you can do what I did and buy it already
				        put together in a kit that includes some sensors, motors, lights,
				        and displays, with a well-written book that tells you how everything
				        works. I got my BASIC Stamp Activity Kit at my local
				        Radio Shack, but you can get it direct from Parallax too. </p>
				  <p>Mention
				        the phrase &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; to programmers and they&rsquo;ll
				        know you&rsquo;re talking about the way new programming environments
				        are tested by trying to get the systems to just print those words
				        to a terminal screen. The equivalent exercise for my Basic Stamp
				        is hooking it up to a computer and writing a program that says &ldquo;Hello
				        World&rdquo; to a debugging/output window that pops up on the computer
				        screen. </p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>Step
				      1: install the programming environment (basically a word
				      processor) on your computer. </li>
				    <li>Step
				      2: connect the stamp to your computer with the serial cable
				      that came with the kit. </li>
				    <li>Step
				      3: pop in the battery to power the stamp. </li>
				    <li>Step
				      4: open a new programming document and type the following.
				      <blockquote>
				        
		                <p class="code">'
			              {$STAMP BS2}</p>
			            <p class="code">'
			              {$PBASIC 2.5}</p>
			            <p class="code">DEBUG &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;</p>
				      </blockquote>
				    </li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>The
				      first and second lines tell the programming environment what
				      kind of microcontroller you&rsquo;re using and what language you&rsquo;re
				      programming in. When this program is loaded on to the chip, the third
				      line tells it, &ldquo;open up a connection to the computer you&rsquo;re
				      connected to and tell the programming environment to open a new debugging/output
				      window and print the words <strong>Hello World</strong> on
				      it.&rdquo; Once you&rsquo;ve written these three lines you compile
				      the program (convert it from English, which you understand, to bytecode,
				      which the processor understands) and get the file on to the microprocessor
				      by clicking a button on the programming editor&rsquo;s toolbar. With
				      any luck the program runs, opens a window, and types <strong>Hello
				      World</strong> in it. That&rsquo;s
				      all there is to programming this kind of microcontroller, and variations
				      of these steps are at the foundation of every microprocessor-controlled
				      device in the world.</p>
				  <h1>Getting a Microcontroller to do Work</h1>
				  <p>Microcontrollers embody the saying &ldquo;software
				    is language that does work&rdquo;, but how do we turn <strong>Hello World</strong> into
				    a blinking light, spinning motor, or responsive sensor? The key is a
				    series of software-controlled circuits within the microcontroller that
				    turn on or off, change their voltage, or pulse in extremely fast and
				    highly controllable ways. Manufacturers of motors, lights, and sensors
				    tailor their products to the operating capabilities of microcontrollers
				    (and visa-versa) making things pretty straightforward once you figure
				    out the general scheme of things.</p>
				  <p>Want to write a program that blinks an LED ten times?
				    Hook the LED to circuit 1 (also called &ldquo;pin 1&rdquo;) and write
				    a program that says (in pseudo code):</p>
				  <blockquote class="code">
				    <p>Send 5 volts
				      to pin 1</p>
				    <p> Wait &frac14; second</p>
				    <p>Send 0 volts
				      to pin 1</p>
				    <p>Wait &frac14; second</p>
				    <p>&hellip; &amp; etc&hellip;</p>
			    </blockquote>
				  <p>Want to get a servo motor to move a lever when you
				    press a button? (Servo motors are a motors that don&rsquo;t spin typically
				    but move an arm across an arc of motion. They are frequently used in
				    robotics, and we&rsquo;ll use one in our soda machine.) Consult the data
				    sheet that comes with the motor to see what kind of electric pulses make
				    it move. Then hook the button to pin 1 and the servo to pin 2 and write
				    a program that says (in pseudo code):</p>
				  <blockquote>
				    <p class="code">Wait until
				      the button is pressed</p>
				    <p class="code">Send some
				      pulses of 5 volt current pin 2 to make the servo rotate
				      from 12-o&rsquo;clock
				      to 2-o&rsquo;clock</p>
			    </blockquote>
				  <p>Infrared sensors (like the one in your TV that responds
				    to your remote-control), RFID readers, temperature/humidity sensors,
				    and other widgets of this ilk are similarly integrated and controlled,
				    usually after a process of trial-and-error and consulting the documentation
				    that comes with them. For example, to read temperature from a digital
				    thermometer chip and sound an alarm if it exceeds 60 degrees, get the
				    chip and a 5-volt buzzer, hook them up, and write some something like
				    this (in pseudo code):</p>
				  <blockquote>
				    <p class="code">Repeat every
				      10 seconds forever:</p>
				    <p class="code">Set up a
				      data connection to the thermometer<br />
				      on pin 1</p>
				    <p class="code">Set up a
				      data connection FROM the thermometer<br />
				      on pin 2</p>
				    <p class="code">Tell the
				      thermometer to wake up (send wakeup data to pin 1)</p>
				    <p class="code">Ask the thermometer
				      for an update (send request to pin 1)</p>
				    <p class="code">Listen for
				      the data from the thermometer</p>
				    <p class="code">If the temperature &gt; 60
				      then send a 2-second long pulse of 5-volt current to pin
				      3 (the buzzer)</p>
			    </blockquote>
				  <p>Of course, I&rsquo;m omitting a lot of detail in
				    the electronics and programming, but this is really the way it all works.
				    Getting from <strong>Hello World</strong> to
				    controlling a sophisticated Internet-enabled contraption is just a matter
				    of adding depth and refinement - and often less depth and refinement
				    than one would imagine.</p>
				  <h1>Functional Requirements for Internet-Enabled Soda Vending</h1>
				  <p>To demonstrate the capabilities of microcontrollers
				    and help conference attendees start their own exploration of them, we&rsquo;re
				    going to build an Internet-enabled soda vending machine. Any good design
				    begins with some requirements, and the following 10 sum up ours. I&rsquo;ll
				    reemphasize that this document won&rsquo;t provide a comprehensive bits-and-atoms
				    blueprint for building your own Internet-enabled vending machine, but
				    it will show enough of the high-level terrain so that readers can begin
				    their own experimentation without getting disoriented too frequently.
				    (We&rsquo;ll sweat the details in the workshop though.)</p>
				  <p>The Vending machine must:</p>
				  <ol>
				    <li>hold a minimum of 6 standard 12 ounce cans of soda</li>
				    <li>provide a mechanism for vending cans and inserting new cans</li>
				    <li>vend a can in response to user input through a Web page</li>
				    <li>report how many cans are in it through a Web page</li>
				    <li>vend a can in response to commands from a television remote-control</li>
				    <li>vend a can in response to being touched with an RFID card</li>
				    <li>vend a can in response to an SMS text message sent to a phone number</li>
				    <li>display its status</li>
				    <li>have exposed parts so people can see how everything works</li>
				    <li>be strong enough to survive being shipped from D.C. to San Francisco</li>
			    </ol>
				  <p>One final requirement is that the whole thing should <em>not</em> look
				      like a terrorist device - I don&rsquo;t want to get arrested by Homeland
				      Security on my way to or from the conference.</p>
				  <h2>Analysis</h2>
				  <p>A glance at the requirements tells us that we&rsquo;re
				    going to have to build some kind of frame to hold the sodas and provide
				    support for whatever electrical/mechanical devices are needed for the
				    brains and muscles of the system. A series of doors or gates are needed
				    to hold cans in place when the system is at rest and to let just one
				    can through when an order is received.</p>
				  <p>We&rsquo;ll need some component to provide the muscles
				    that open and close the vending gate and the other gate that temporarily
				    restrains the other cans, something that can receive and interpret Infrared
				    (IR) signals from a remote control, and something that can read and interpret
				    radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. We&rsquo;ll need an interface
				    that lets us receive and process SMS messages, and some way to show status
				    like an LCD display or a series of lights. And we&rsquo;ll need a Web
				    server too. Last, but not least, this operation will need some brains
				    - something to converse with and coordinate the IR, RFID, and SMS components,
				    the gates, and the Web server, keep track of the can counts, and decide
				    if and when to dispense a can. What sounded so simple in concept seems
				    kind of daunting now!</p>
				  <h2>Design</h2>
				  <p>Fortunately, we don&rsquo;t have to forge all of
				    this from raw materials. </p>
				  <p>Starting with the brains first: surprise-surprise,
				    microcontrollers fit the bill perfectly! A BS2 Basic Stamp kit from Parallax
				    will get us up and running quickly and will be good for prototyping and
				    experimentation at the conference workshop.</p>
				  <p>For the IR sensor, there&rsquo;s a small component
				    from Parallax called the IR Buddy (part 28016) that can read and store
				    IR signals until the stamp is ready to read them. (IR communication uses
				    a complicated protocol that would be too messy to use directly in a project
				    like this)</p>
				  <p>The RFID challenge can be handled in a similar way
				    with a circuit board that has an RFID antenna that energizes RFID chips
				    commonly found in ID cards and merchandise inventory-control tags, reads
				    the resulting signal radiated by the card or tag, and streams the data
				    out to be read by - you guessed it, a microcontroller! Parallax has a
				    good one (part 8140) that can plug right into my Basic Stamp&rsquo;s
				    circuitry. I found a nifty article in <em>Make</em> magazine
				    (volume 6, <em>RFID for Makers</em>)
				    that shows how this component works.</p>
				  <p>The SMS design challenge is somewhat similar: we
				    just need some way to interface with a mobile phone and ask it to tell
				    us when it receives an SMS message and send us the message text. Nokia
				    makes a line of cellular phones that allow you to control them with a
				    PC or microcontroller through a serial data cable called an F-Bus connector.
				    I&rsquo;ll track down a Nokia 3310/3315 (suggested
				    by <a href="../http://www.embedtronics.com/nokia/fbus.html" target="_blank">http://www.embedtronics.com/nokia/fbus.html</a>)
				    and order a cable.</p>
				  <p>The displaying-status requirement can be fulfilled
				    with an off-the-shelf LCD character display that Parallax sells specifically
				    to be integrated with microprocessors and which comes with sample code
				    that works on the Basic Stamp. (Part 27976)</p>
				  <p>To provide the muscles for the gates, I chose a
				    Parallax Standard Servo motor (part 900-00005), and I&rsquo;m planning
				    on scrounging the parts needed to make the actual gates that retain and
				    dispense cans.</p>
				  <p>For the frame and gates, I&rsquo;ll sketch out a
				    wooden ramp with two sides to keep the cans in and a wooden hood over
				    the bottom end of the ramp to support the mechanism that controls the
				    vending. Cans will be held in place or released by two pins made out
				    of an old bicycle spoke. At rest the system will tell a servo motor to
				    push one pin down to stop the cans from rolling down the ramp, and when
				    vending the servo will pull up one pin (releasing one can) while lowering
				    the second pin to prevent subsequent cans from rolling out. </p>

				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      2: A section-view representation of servo-controlled retaining and
				      vending a can.</p>
				  <p>The Web server integration seemed like the most
				    daunting piece initially, but the embedded Web server from Parallax,
				    the <em>Parallax Internet Netburner Kit</em>,
				    or PINK (part 30013), and others like it, are really just customized
				    microprocessors themselves and appear to have specifications that are
				    compatible with our project. The PINK server has the ability to store
				    variables and display them on Web pages with a simple markup language

				  <h1>Construction </h1>
				  <p>I was able to get the Internet-enabled soda-vending
				    machine up on and running in about a week by picking away at for an hour
				    or two at a time. (Writing this paper took a lot longer than making the
				    machine it&rsquo;s about.) I&rsquo;ll post schematics and source code
				    before, during, and after the workshop.</p>
				  <p>The hardware/software integration - getting this
				    thing to listen and react - was facilitated by the fact that almost all
				    of the individual components could be built and tested independently,
				    so I never had to deal with more than a few variables at a time. In addition,
				    while the technology behind all of these things is pretty hard-core geeky,
				    the components themselves only do one or two things and they&rsquo;re
				    either doing them, or not doing them - once they&rsquo;re doing them,
				    they pretty much chug along forever until you pull the power. The stability
				    and simplicity of microprocessors and related components is one of the
				    reasons why they&rsquo;re used in so many commercial products. </p>
				  <p>So now I can sit in my home or office confident
				    that anybody with a cell phone or anybody on the Web can connect to my
				    vending machine and get a soda, or that I myself can get one with a swipe
				    of my RFID card or a poke with my remote control. Working on this has
				    helped me dream up one home project and two or three work projects, and
				    I can&rsquo;t wait to find an excuse to go back to parallax.com, sparkfun.com,
				    or Radio Shack to find some new gizmo. </p>
				  <p>I was an art major in college and a creative guy
				    for many years after, and I avoided acquiring most of the engineering,
				    math, and physics knowledge - not to mention computer science skills!
				    - that many of my geekier colleagues take for granted. Experimenting
				    with microprocessors has been an eye opener. It&rsquo;s made me more
				    aware of the way standards, <em>good</em> <em>open</em> standards,
				    foster innovation and stimulate creativity; it&rsquo;s made me more aware
				    of how computers actually work; and it&rsquo;s made me infinitely more
				    sensitive to the extraordinary unrealized potential of the Internet and
				    the Web. Where data, software, physical objects, and the human mind can
				    interact freely, interesting things are bound to happen.</p>
