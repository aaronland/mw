      <p class="abstractText">Wikipedia is suitable, indeed recommended, for
        encyclopedic entries on all museums. However, further more extended use
        by museums for their own purposes is not encouraged or appropriate in
        general. If this is required, it is possible for a museum to set up its
        own wiki with suitable technical support. Alternatively, if support is
        not available, it is possible to use other external wiki facilities.
        A museums wiki has been set up expressly for this purpose and other experiments
        concerning museum-related information (<a href="../http://museums.wikia.com/" target="_blank">http://museums.wikia.com</a>).
        Museums and people interested in museums are encouraged to add to this
        wiki and promote community use of it. This demonstration will present
        this wiki facility and its contents, including its inter-relationship
        with Wikipedia, covering what has been achieved so far and also the potential
        for the future. We expect this wiki to be available for continuing use
        by museums, including <em>Museums and the Web</em> conference attendees,
        for the foreseeable future.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Wiki technology is not new in Web terms, the first having been introduced
      in 1995, but it is now gaining increasing acceptance as a useful tool for
      on-line collaboration (Bowen, 2006). However, it may not be particularly
      easy for the novice user both in terms of the technical facilities and
      understanding the process of developing a successful wiki. Wikis are a
      technology that allow and encourage collaboration on-line. There are competing
      technologies such as blogs and the rather older and more widely used e-mail
      (Bristow, 2005; Kelley, 2005; Richardson, 2006). Wikis, with their direct
      Web interface, work well when a group of people with a critical mass wish
      to achieve some collaborative purpose concerning information on-line, without
      geographical considerations apart from access to the Internet. They are
      increasingly used on company intranets and extranets for intra-company
      collaboration. Their use in the public sector (e.g., libraries, education,
      government, etc.) has also been considered (Guy, 2005).</p>
    <p>Currently there is not much public use of wikis by museums. Greenmuseum.org,
      which describes itself as a &ldquo;nonprofit on-line museum of environmental
      art&rdquo;, provides a wiki on-line (<a href="../http://wiki.greenmuseum.org/" target="_blank">http://wiki.greenmuseum.org</a>).
      The Kew Bridge Steam Museum in London (<a href="../http://www.kbsm.org/" target="_blank">http://www.kbsm.org</a>)
      has a wiki for use by staff and volunteers to enable research collaboration.
      However, to the knowledge of the authors, there are still no widely used
      public museum-based resources using wiki technology on-line.</p>
    <p>Wikipedia (<a href="../http://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">http://www.wikipedia.org</a>)
      has been the first extremely successful wiki to enter the public consciousness.
      It is a general encyclopedia that now rivals even the likes of the <em>Encyclopaedia
      Britannica</em> (<a href="../http://www.britannica.com/" target="_blank">http://www.britannica.com</a>).
      A study by the leading scientific journal <em>Nature</em> indicated that
      the quality of selected important scientific entries was not dissimilar
      when Wikipedia and Encyclopaedia Britannica were compared in detail (Giles,
      2005). Of course Encyclopaedia Britannica contested the study (Nature,
      2006), even though it was shown to provide slightly better quality information,
      but not outstandingly so.</p>
    <p>Perhaps Wikipedia&rsquo;s greatest strength (and some think its significant
      weakness), especially compared to a traditional encyclopedia such as the
      Encyclopaedia Britannica, is that it can be updated by anybody at any time.
      Thus both experts and vandals can update entries at will. However, Wikipedia
      has now reached such a critical mass of users (both readers and writers),
      that inappropriate entries and changes to entries are picked up by both &ldquo;Wikipedians&rdquo; and
      automated robot software that scans changed Wikipedia entries with suitable
      heuristics for detecting many of the typical changes made by people who
      do not have the public good at heart in their editing. This is much like
      real life where people drop litter, but others are altruistically willing
      to pick it up subsequently. The Wikipedia community is now sufficiently
      large that the process is very fast (literally minutes) for important entries.</p>
    <p>Wikipedia is an excellent resource for museums, both for (at least initial)
      research and for publicity concerning the museum itself. A paper in <em>Museums
      and the Web 2006</em> (Bowen &amp; Angus 2006) explained in practical detail
      how museums can create their own entries on Wikipedia. Indeed, every real
      museum is deserving of a Wikipedia entry, and it is highly recommended
      that museum curators either create an entry for their museum (using an
      independent rather than marketing tone, since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia
      rather than a commercial tool), or correct and add to any existing entry.
      This should ideally be done by someone with a good knowledge of the museum
      rather than a member of the marketing department, unless the latter is
      able to take a very independent and non-promotional view of the entry.
      For example, information on the history of the museum is much more appropriate
      than details of the latest temporary exhibitions, which can be provided
      on the museum&rsquo;s own Web site, with a suitable link from the Wikipedia
      entry if desired.</p>
    <p>Since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia documenting &ldquo;notable&rdquo; information,
      it can only include limited information on any given museum. For very large
      museums of international repute, it may be appropriate to have entries
      for individual items in the collection (e.g., important paintings). However,
      at some level, items will be deemed inappropriate by other members of the
      Wikipedia community and could be suggested for deletion. This is a situation
      best avoided by professional museums.</p>
    <p>To allow museums more free rein in creating wiki entries, a wiki dedicated
      particularly for museums and related issues has been established using
      the Wikia facility (<a href="../http://wikia.com/" target="_blank">http://wikia.com</a>).
      This was initially started as Wikicities in 2004 and is provided as a free
      service (supported by reasonably discrete Google advertisements) for communities
      with a wide enough remit to be considered worthwhile by the managers of
      Wikia. A proposal has to be submitted and accepted before a new Wikia wiki
      is established, and it is not intended for personal wikis of limited appeal.
      For that, there are other facilities such as PBwiki (<a href="../http://pbwiki.com/" target="_blank">http://pbwiki.com</a>)
      where a wiki can very quickly be established by anyone in a few minutes
      (e.g., see <a href="../http://jpbowen.pbwiki.com/" target="_blank">http://jpbowen.pbwiki.com</a>).
      The basic facilities of PBwiki are free, but to expand further there is
      a (not unreasonable) monthly charge.</p>
    <p>A Museums Wiki has been accepted by Wikia and was established in 2006
      (<a href="../http://museums.wikia.com/" target="_blank">http://museums.wikia.com</a>).
      So far this has been used for experimental purposes, but museums are encouraged
      to use it for any museum-related entries that they would like to create.
      This may be especially appropriate if the material is not suitable for
      Wikipedia (e.g., if it is too detailed or marketing-oriented). The issue
      of notability and marketing is not applicable on the Museums Wiki. The
      main criterion for acceptability applicable on this wiki is that the material
      is museum-related. Of course the site is still an open wiki like Wikipedia,
      so no one person has overall control of the material. Any entry could be
      updated by others. Thus it is mainly useful where collaboration is being
      actively encouraged (e.g., by on-line museum visitors).</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="bowen-fig1-inline.jpg" alt="Figure 1" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 1: A screenshot of the main page of the Museums Wiki
      (<a href="../http://museums.wikia.com/" target="_blank">http://museums.wikia.com</a>).</p>
    <p>For more control, a museum could set up its own wiki on its own Web site.
      This is reasonably easy to do with suitable technical support (i.e., probably
      less than a day&rsquo;s work for anyone with reasonable technical knowledge).
      There are various wiki software systems available, many free. Perhaps the
      leading one is MediaWiki (<a href="../http://www.mediawiki.org/" target="_blank">http://www.mediawiki.org</a>),
      as used by Wikipedia. This has the advantage that anyone familiar with
      Wikipedia will find it easy to use, particularly with regard to the editing
      and markup facilities.</p>
    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>In this section we present some experiences of using the Museums Wiki
      from the point of view of novice wiki users, in the hope that this will
      help other museum professionals in their first use of a wiki.</p>
    <p>The following may be useful information before starting on a wiki:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Wikipedia to find out about the markup language. For example, have
        a look at the tutorial (<a href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial</a>)</li>
      <li>It is good to try out on the &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; facility on Wikipedia.
        You may be reluctant to start initially because mistakes seem to be very
        public and archives are kept. It is not like a blog where you can normally
        delete and completely wipe out your mistakes. Instead a history is kept
        and only wiki administrators can completely delete material.</li>
      <li>Starting on the tutorial means you gain some confidence with some experience
        behind you before attempting real entries.</li>
      <li>Although you can use the wiki, many people are more used to using a
        blog where there is more personal control. A blog is good as a diary
        of information stored in (reverse) temporal order. A wiki maintains a
        history for each entry in a similar way, but this is less emphasized.
        Instead the most recent version of each entry is the one that is available
        for viewing by default. In any case, there is no reason why different
        tools cannot be used with suitable links between them. It is possible
        to use a wiki as a collaborative space to keep notes and maintain a collective
        memory. For people used to blogs, this might take time to assimilate.</li>
      <li> According to the O&rsquo;Reilly Network (http://www.oreillynet.com),
        a wiki is good for the following (Stafford &amp; Webb, 2006):
        <p class="BlockQuote">Good for writing down quick ideas or longer ones,
          giving you more time for formal writing and editing.</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Instantly collaborative without emailing documents,
          keeping the group in sync.</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Accessible from anywhere with a web connection
          (if you don't mind writing in web-browser text forms).</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Your archive, because every page revision is kept.</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Exciting, immediate, and empowering - everyone
          has a say.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
    <p>A wiki is certainly all that, but it takes time to assimilate the process
        and the learning curve needed to collaborate effectively. </p>
    <p>With respect to collaboration on a wiki, the following is recommended:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For good collaboration, it is necessary to find and enthuse other people
        who are passionate about the subject area to be covered by the wiki.</li>
      <li>Get a clear idea from the people you are working with about what the
        project is going to achieve (Tonkin, 2005).</li>
      <li>It is best to choose a topic about which you are keen and knowledgeable
        to have a good chance of the project developing successfully. Considering &ldquo;museums&rdquo; as
        a topic is rather a wide subject to try to cover as an individual. For
        novices, there is a big learning curve and they need motivation to learn
        how to collaborate with wikis.</li>
      <li>Collaboration means constant and frequent communication, so it is necessary
        to engage with the wiki regularly.</li>
      <li>There should be some targets and objectives - just like any project
        management plan.</li>
      <li>Look forward to the time when the team becomes obsessive about the
        wiki.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Making contributions to a wiki site may not be as straightforward as you
      may think if you are a beginner.&nbsp; Here is a list of tips that may
      help other museum professionals who are wiki beginners at enriching a wiki
      site. They relate to the structure of the Museums Wiki Web site and use
      it for&nbsp; appropriate examples.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First of all, do not forget to create a user account on the wiki and
        ensure that you are logged into this account every time you want to make
        any contribution. Otherwise the site will capture the IP address of the
        computer from which you have been doing edits but will not record your
        username identification in the history of edits made.</li>
      <li>Generally, any creation added to a wiki site is called an &ldquo;edit&rdquo;,
        so to add something new to the site, look for this word.</li>
      <li>A basic distinction to be made concerns the difference between creating
        a new category in the site and creating a new content page, as the function
        of each is very different. Categories allow structure of the content
        news so they can be traversed in a normally hierarchical and logical
        way. For example, the Museums Wiki is composed of an ever-growing number
        of categories that structure the site according to topical and geographical
        criteria (for example, &ldquo;Awards&rdquo;, &ldquo;Conferences&rdquo;, &ldquo;Glossaries&rdquo;, &ldquo;Museums&rdquo;, &ldquo;Resources&rdquo;, &ldquo;Websites&rdquo;,
        etc.).</li>
      <li>Most categories are divided into subcategories, thus giving a route
        to individual pages with specific information about a single issue: for
        instance, under the category &ldquo;Countries&rdquo; you find several
        subcategories, one of them being &ldquo;Belgium&rdquo;, which contains
        a page on the &ldquo;Royal Museum for Central Africa&rdquo;.&nbsp; This
        is also accessible more directly under the &ldquo;Museums&rdquo; category.
        A topmost category called &ldquo;Categories&rdquo; has been created,
        linked from the main Museums Wiki home page, which is a good starting
        point for other categories.</li>
      <li>Thus, in order to see all existing categories, click on &ldquo;Categories&rdquo; on
        the main page of the Museums Wiki site. If there is a category you would
        like to insert, say &ldquo;Fellowships&rdquo;, then you need to create
        a new wiki page called &ldquo;Category:Fellowships&rdquo;. In order to
        make sure that this does not exist already, type &ldquo;Category:Fellowships&rdquo; in
        the search box at the left hand side of the Web interface. If it does
        exist, it will take you to it; otherwise it will give you the option
        to create such category. In order to add a new category, edit it and
        just add (as a minimum) &ldquo;[[Category:Categories]]&rdquo; to place
        it in the topmost category. As a result, now your category will be included
        in the main categories page. It is also possible to add further categories
        as required and appropriate.</li>
      <li>Now what you want to do is to fill your new category with content pages
        (and perhaps further sub-categories as well). In order to do this, type
        the desired page title into the search box as we want to make sure that
        such an entry does not exist already in the Museum Wiki site. Let us
        say that we want to write about &ldquo;Metropolitan Museum Grants&rdquo; within
        the Fellowships category. If this entry is not there, click on the &ldquo;create
        this page&rdquo; link that will appear on the screen, add the text in
        the edit box, write a brief summary of the edit in the summary line box
        that appears below the edit box. We need to add the &ldquo;Fellowships&rdquo; category
        using &ldquo;[[Category:Fellowships]]&rdquo; at the end of the text box
        information. When finished, press the &ldquo;Save page&rdquo; button
        below the summary line box.</li>
      <li>It is advisable to click on &ldquo;Show preview&rdquo; before actually
        saving edit to check that what has been written about the new content
        does not contain mistakes, grammatical errors or discrepancies. If we
        or any other wiki user notices that there is a mistake in what has been
        written or simply wants to modify it, it is necessary to click on the &ldquo;edit&rdquo; option
        that appears above the written&nbsp; text, and add the new contribution
        in a similar manner as just explained.</li>
      <li>Normally when we are editing new content we need to insert any referred
        Web site related to that content - for instance, its official URL if
        it has one. If we simply write down a URL address, it will appear in
        the text as http://... with a link to the Web site. Links to Wikipedia
        entries on the Museums Wiki can be made using a macro of the form &ldquo;{{wp|&hellip;}}&rdquo; where
        the dots are the name of the Wikipedia page. </li>
      <li>If all this seems confusing, the best way to learn how to make edits
        is to pick any wiki page on the site at random, and press the &ldquo;edit&rdquo; button
        in order to view how that page was created and uploaded to the site.
        There is a (fairly simple) markup language for bold text, URL links,
        categories (as briefly covered above), etc. Viewing other wiki pages
        that include the formatting you require is a good way to learn the markup
        language.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Conclusions</h1>
    <p>In conclusion, there is a choice of wiki facilities available to museums,
      depending on the goal required. For general information on a museum, an
      entry on Wikipedia is highly recommended (Bowen &amp; Angus 2006). For
      a more expansive set of entries than is suitable for Wikipedia, the Museums
      Wiki covered in this paper may be suitable (<a href="../http://museums.wikia.com/" target="_blank">http://museums.wikia.com</a>).
      If a museum requires more control over wiki entries (both for reading and
      writing), a wiki facility on its own Web site (e.g., using MediaWiki software &ndash; <a href="../http://www.mediawiki.org/" target="_blank">http://www.mediawiki.org</a>)
      may be the most appropriate solution. This may work well in association
      with a special exhibition where public participation is encouraged, or
      for in-house projects where collaboration is being encouraged, especially
      among a geographically separated team (e.g., including museum personnel
      and a company).</p>
    <p>For a successful wiki, a critical mass of users is need; otherwise it
      will simply stagnate. It is also important to have one or two people responsible
      for overseeing the wiki, ensuring entries are appropriate, and editing
      them when not, perhaps with a warning to the user concerned in more extreme
      cases. For some, this loss of control is a worry when wikis are used. For
      others, this is part of the excitement, allowing the unexpected to become
      possible. In any case, there are ways to control wiki use if necessary
      (e.g., administrators can lock pages from being changed and ban particular
      IP addresses from making updates). Normally the problem is encouraging
      worthwhile use rather than discouraging inappropriate use. The latter can
      easily be corrected, anyway, with suitable monitoring.</p>
    <p>For the future, it would be interesting to have more studies on the actual
      use of wikis. Successful wikis like Wikipedia have a large virtual community
      with conventions concerning the running of the wiki (e.g., the removal
      of unsuitable pages) that have grown up with time. The background of such
      communities is largely unknown and most members have never met each other.
      Studies in a museum context (Beler et al., 2004) and with respect to different
      backgrounds such as gender (Boiano et al., 2006; Gunn et al., 2006), etc.,
      would be worthwhile.</p>
    <p>Currently, supporting literature on wikis, especially books, is relatively
      lacking. See, for example, Ebersbach et al. (2006). More are due to appear,
      both at a personal (Woods, 2007) and professional (Choate, 2007) level.
      Copyright is an issue with any material placed on-line (Numerico &amp; Bowen,
      2006), and it is recommended that copyrighted material be avoided in public
      wikis in general. Interlinking with Wikipedia is highly recommended where
      appropriate since Wikipedia is highly rated by Google and other search
      engines. This will help to improve the search engine ranking of the wiki
      facility and the museum Web site itself if suitably interlinked (Numerico
      et al., 2005).</p>
    <p>In summary, all museum professionals engaged in using and exploiting on-line
      technology are encouraged to try wiki collaboration. It should not be expected
      that the benefits are immediately apparent. Like most good things, it takes
      a while to learn and adapt to the wiki environment and culture, but once
      that is done, the less obvious benefits become apparent. In particular,
      readers are very much encouraged to experiment with the Museums Wiki. Provided
      material added is museum-related, the site is likely to be further improved
      and developed by other wiki users (not least by authors of this paper!).</p>
