  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This paper provides a context for a professional forum to
    consider the roles that can be played by museums, museologists, technologists
    and Indigenous cultural community members to support and rebuild cultural
    communities and to preserve indigenous cultures. As such work often does not
    take place within institutional walls, it is necessary to think about the many
    distributed tasks that can be successfully employed to bridge the gap between
    ephemeral cultural knowledge and practices and the long-term preservation of
    representations of the culture.</p>
  <p>Victor Steffensen (2006) has developed a process for working
    with Australian Aboriginal Elders to articulate and represent sacred, secret
    and generally known knowledge, language and practices before it is too late.
    Victor works with Elders of the Quinkan region
    in far northern Australia, recording their stories and practices for their own
    community. One area of knowledge that has attracted international interest
    concerns the traditional practices of &lsquo;caring for country&rsquo;. Australia is a
    fragile country, and this ecological knowledge is being considered very
    seriously in an effort to reverse the deterioration that has been accelerated
    in the last 150 years by recent settlers&rsquo; land use.</p>
  <p>The Traditional Knowledge Recording Project (<a
href="../http://www.tkrp.com.au/" target="_blank">http://www.tkrp.com.au/</a>) is one of many
    at-risk projects operating around the world: the gathering of traditional
    knowledge helps build community and strengthen the knowledge. But without a
    secure future, these records may suffer the same fate as the unrecorded
    knowledge. Museums that traditionally specialise in preservation of many types
    are interested in and can contribute to the preservation debate in important
    ways. Other disciplinary experts can point to special characteristics and
    issues in the preservation of indigenous cultures. A simple example is the
    problem for indigenous people of establishing trustworthy relationships with
    technologists and others who do not have real connections with the culture. Who
    can and should collect and control access to indigenous knowledge is always an
    issue and rarely is settled in ways that are satisfactory for all concerned. </p>
  <p>How should cultural knowledge be collected, displayed,
    distributed, published, etc?</p>
  <p>We start with some of the identified problems as they relate
    to the Quinkan culture of far north eastern Australia. We briefly orient the
    paper to the Quinkan location and community. We consider the problematic role
    of technology, as we were involved with it, to contribute in a small way to the
    on-going efforts to preserve Quinkan culture. We raise some of many concerns
    related to work by outsiders within indigenous communities and the inherent
    difficulties of such work. We refer to the Australian context where there have
    been two centuries of interaction between the &lsquo;recent immigrants&rsquo; and the
    indigenous people. We note the changing models that have prevailed in the
    dominant cultural preservation activities. We invite the experience of museums
    and museologists, technologists and others to suggest ways outsiders may help
    those working within indigenous cultural communities in the future to
    strengthen and preserve what the indigenous people value of their culture.</p>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>The extreme north east of Australia has been home to
    Indigenous Australians for many millennia. Their cultural documentation
    includes Rock Art that dates back way beyond immediate human memory, partly
    because it is so old but also because of the tempestuous times through which
    the few remaining cultural trustees have survived. Nevertheless, there have
    been increased efforts to conserve and share the rich Quinkan heritage in
    recent years. In a number of projects, there has been an effort not only
    to preserve the local culture but also to repatriate some of the wide-spread
    resources that have been collected and then scattered around the world by
    those interested in this region. Our work was designed to contribute to this
    effort by improving access to internationally published Web resources. </p>
  <p>In this paper, we start to describe the context of our
    investigations with respect to the partnerships that can be developed between
    traditional western cultural organizations, particularly museums, and the
    people of diverse indigenous cultures scattered around the world. We focus on
    our experiences in Australia in order to provide a context for discussion of
    other circumstances.</p>
  <h2>Quinkan Country</h2>
  <p>&lsquo;Quinkan Country&rsquo; is in Tropical North East Australia, on
    the Cape York Peninsula. It includes the Laura sandstone ridge, which extends
    100 km along an east-west axis from the coastal Cooktown hinterland to the Hann
    tablelands. The southern boundary follows the course of the Palmer River, once
    the focus of extensive gold mining, and in the north, along the alluvial plains
    of the lower Normanby River. The main population centre, Laura, is
    approximately 290 km north-west of Cairns, the nearest town. The region is
    famous for its Rock Art: an estimated 100,000 paintings and engravings
    scattered in natural galleries and sites throughout the lush savannah and high
    escarpments.</p>
  <p>The local Indigenous community includes families
    representing different language groups, some descendants of the original
    inhabitants. Despite some displacement of the original inhabitants and
    disruption to traditional life, there is still a strong sense of connection
    with ancestral places. There is an annual dance festival at which Aboriginal
    communities from the Peninsula meet to refresh traditional dance and music and
    to enjoy modern indigenous music.</p>
  <p>In the 1960s, bush pilot Percy J. Trezise &lsquo;re-discovered&rsquo;
    the Rock Art and started documenting paintings and recording stories with
    Aboriginal people whose country covered the Laura sandstone region and beyond (Trezise, 1993). </p>
  <p>For Australian Indigenous communities, the desire for return
    of cultural property and control over its use is matched by an equally strong
    ambition to produce and disseminate content for public consumption. The Lajamanu
    Elders of north-west Australia have produced &ldquo;Dream Trackers&rdquo; on
    CD-ROM (Glowczewski, 2000); the Yanyuwa community maintains a public Web
    site (<a
href="../http://www.deakin.edu.au/arts/diwurruwurru/" target="_blank">http://www.deakin.edu.au/arts/diwurruwurru/</a>);
    and there is a string of regional visitor centres displaying interpretive
    content on fixed panels as part of the Queensland Heritage Trails Network
    (<a
href="../http://www.heritagetrails.qld.gov.au/attractions/laura.html" target="_blank">http://www.heritagetrails.qld.gov.au/attractions/laura.html</a>).
    These methods of cultural content dissemination share the common characteristic
    of being static. Even in non-linear systems, CD-ROMs and Web sites, the content
    is usually classified according to pre-set categories and is presented in
    a pre-determined arrangement. </p>
  <p>Internationally, the museum community acknowledges that
    meeting the needs of the on-line users of cultural content requires new ways of
    fielding data and new ways of creating content. While the Western point of view
    on management and interpretation of cultural materials is still prevalent,
    there is an emergent shift away from empirical and authoritative statements
    about objects towards multiple and more subjective narratives (Cameron, 2003). </p>
  <h2>Collectors And Collectives</h2>
  <p>Access and use of their cultural resources are vital to the
    cultural revitalisation of communities (Fforde et al., 2002; Peers &amp; Brown, 2003). People in remote Australian Indigenous communities such as Laura cannot afford to travel to where their materials are held. Despite having a cultural centre building, they cannot afford to repatriate all their materials &lsquo;in Country&rsquo; or maintain a Keeping Place. The principle of expanded use helps promote access to cultural material without imposing the cost of supporting a cultural institution, but it creates the challenge to make remote resources intellectually accessible to an extended (and often undefined) user base. </p>
  <p>The Matchbox Project, in which we were involved as
    technologists, chose to work on supporting the repatriation of remote cultural
    material after having shown the local community some examples of what was
    written about them without their permission or involvement. A particularly
    striking example was a Web page that, printed on continuous paper, presented
    several metres of unauthorised, inaccurate anthropological material to the
    world. Such examples prompted the permission of Elders of Laura for the use of
    technology if it could help bring such materials to their attention.</p>
  <p>Matchbox was designed to be a metadata repository that, in
    time, might become a repository for cultural material as a result of community
    activity. Matchbox could be used for local materials being repatriated to those
    who now lived &lsquo;off country&rsquo; and for remote materials for those who continued to
    live &lsquo;on country&rsquo;. While it seemed obvious to us that metadata could provide a
    flexible platform from which to tailor content searching, browsing and
    navigating, and displays of search results to suit user needs, this was not a
    shared understanding. And clearly, before metadata could be expected to offer
    any contribution, there needed to be a deep reflection on how metadata might be
    meaningful to the Quinkan community and whether and how they might choose to
    use it. </p>
  <h2>Cultural Heritage As A Process</h2>
  <p>Edwards (2003) argues that photographs or films originally
    produced as colonial documents became &lsquo;ethnographic&rsquo; records, but they can
    become family, clan or community history once repatriated. When they are
    returned to the original location, they inevitably return to different social
    relations.  Edwards stresses that, &ldquo;communities are faced with what is known to
    them from their own ways of remembering, through the eyes of an outsider, with
    very different resonances&rdquo; (p. 86). </p>
  <p>Cultural heritage professionals who seek new theoretical
    bases for cultural heritage assessment are moving away from the &lsquo;registrar
    view&rsquo; to include social processes (Byrne et al., 2001). Traditionally, archaeologists adopted the &lsquo;inherent&rsquo; value model: the value of a place can be read from the place. Byrne et al. advocate the &lsquo;attributed&rsquo; meaning model, in which a community confers significance and meaning on a place. This model places communities, not objects, at the centre of cultural heritage. It recognises the primacy of local knowledge in ascribing social value and meaning to heritage sites. </p>
  <p>Byrne&rsquo;s vision of heritage work in the wider community is
    quite similar to the Indigenous way of reading a cultural landscape. It is
    about deciphering the tenuous and invisible markings in the landscape and
    understanding the discreet network of relationships between place, people and
    meanings.</p>
  <p>Smith and Holland (1999) develop a concept of &lsquo;digital
    collective&rsquo; that offers a way to reconcile the views of Indigenous people on
  &lsquo;memory work&rsquo; and the technical limitations imposed on the technologists. They
    propose &ldquo;an organizational structure that draws in contributions from
    individuals and collectors and encourages comment and connections amongst
    viewers&rdquo;. They use the word &lsquo;collective&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;collection&rsquo; for their
    model because it is envisaged as &ldquo;a community space where non experts and
    ordinary people can enter their digital objects along with their information,
    stories, and experiences about their own or other objects in the collective
    database&rdquo;. Smith (2002) argues that, &ldquo;the collective becomes a record of
    society itself in addition to a rich repository of objects and descriptive
    information.&rdquo; In the digital collective model, institutions of memory
    contribute on a par with individuals. The model appeals to us, as outsiders, as
    having particular relevance to the Quinkan context because of the distributed
    nature of the Quinkan cultural property. Also, it places a strong emphasis on
    the notion of collective responsibility in repatriating cultural artifacts to
    communities.</p>
  <p>Exactly what model is suitable and what will appeal to the
    Quinkan community is not to be determined by us. It is our desire to inform the
    choice by offering enabling technology. But technology alone cannot solve the problem.
    Finding ways to identify, describe and implement a chosen model is clearly a
    difficult exercise.</p>
  <h2>Cultural Collections And Community Archives</h2>
  <p>In the Quinkan project, we were working with the assumption
    that a distributed digital museum might be of interest and value in the process
    of repatriation of Quinkan culture. </p>
  <p>We are aware that distributed digital museums have altered
    the traditional definitions and boundaries of what constitutes a &lsquo;collection&rsquo;.
    In the physical museum world, a collection is usually defined by physical
    demarcation or co-location of resources. In the networked world, objects need
    not be co-located. One of the qualities of distributed digital objects is that
    they can exist in multiple collections, have multiple instantiations and retain
    differing cataloguing and administration rules (Lagoze &amp; Fielding, 1998; Lee, 2000). </p>
  <p>In Australia, community archives in Indigenous communities
    are promoted by initiatives such as the Australian Indigenous Cultural Network
    (AICN) and the creation of Indigenous Knowledge Centres (IKC). IKC
    initiatives focus primarily on infrastructure building and support as well as
    training opportunities. Other projects involve the return of cultural materials
    through the creation of digital surrogates of artefacts that are then held
    locally (Partos, 2003). Other types of initiatives include traveling exhibitions or the return of photographs to communities of origins such as the project &ldquo;Bringing the Photographs Home&rdquo; (<a
href="../http://www.berndt.uwa.edu.au/" target="_blank">http://www.berndt.uwa.edu.au/</a>)
    led by the Berdnt Museum (Western Australia). The Berndt team stressed the
    necessity to repatriate materials both in a digital and hardcopy format, to let
    indigenous communities access their own archives . An inherent danger in such projects is that the returning of objects, or facsimiles of them, can too easily become more a symbolic process than a reality. </p>
  <p>Community archives are primarily organised around local use
    and local needs, not for interaction with other systems. Compliance with
    standards and inter-operability are seldom considerations in these activities.
    The challenge for the Quinkan research was to design an application profile for
    the Quinkan Matchbox records that is both locally specific and interoperable
    with standards-compliant DC records of existing subject gateways, museums,
    libraries and other Australian (and international) collections. The aim was to
    facilitate the importation (or harvesting) of metadata about cultural material
    without having to negotiate the return of digitised materials.</p>
  <p>The basic functionality of an information system for
    Indigenous cultural management should respond to challenges set for its future
    and be more than just a catalogue; it should provide a &lsquo;cultural environment&rsquo;.
    It should enable users to connect things they perceive as related. This aim is
    informed and limited by the system developers&rsquo; understanding of the concepts of
    culture and heritage. Ideally these should reflect an Indigenous point-of-view,
    best summed up as &lsquo;Country&rsquo; or cultural landscape.</p>
  <p>We recognise the contradiction between acknowledging
    indigenous cultures as living cultures and attempting to hold them captive in
  &lsquo;systems&rsquo; for preservation (Merlan, 2000), and we are aware that repatriation
    of objects or archival materials (digitised or not) may have a destabilising
    effect on communities if not handled sensitively and with respect for
    indigenous protocols (Saunders, 2002). </p>
  <p>We struggled with the difficulty and inadequacies of
    applying conventional requirement gathering techniques in our context. We
    failed to satisfy even ourselves that we had determined appropriate
    requirements, and we are not sure how this could be done. We note the
    experience of museums in this context, and we recognize the difficulty of
    working with people whose understanding of the technology is very different
    from our own. We suspect that only by working together can we learn from these
    experiences and communicate openly to develop effective and desirable designs.</p>
  <p>In our digital collective model, metadata is at best a small
    component of an amalgam of technical infrastructure, legal agreements and human
    engagement that could be built, financed and staffed. Far from being a final
    delivery, at best our metadata profile could provide no more than the first
    iteration of a process requiring ongoing scrutiny, assessment and feedback from
    the Quinkan community.</p>
  <p>The Quinkan Matchbox was intended to be a &lsquo;content free&rsquo;
    cultural tool, but we recognized that the development of a metadata profile for
    the Quinkan culture would introduce questions of cultural definitions. We were
    confronted with a methodological and ethical dilemma. How does an outsider
    investigate &lsquo;culture&rsquo; in an environment where the right to speak is highly regulated?
    Can systems represent the infinite nuances and variations of human experience
    and affects? </p>
  <h2>A Registry Of Tangible
    Assets</h2>
  <p>When designing application profiles, the main parameters are
    usually users and objects. The most visible incarnation of the Quinkan culture
    is represented by a large corpus of Rock Art. For these types of objects,
    descriptive profiles are readily available or easily devised. A catalogue with
    an archaeological focus can easily be built to describe archaeological
    artefacts ranging from an isolated Rock Art motif to a large site and its
    immediate environment. Its profile could replicate the record-keeping structure
    of archaeologists or environmental agencies with attention paid to physical
    description, condition and degradation reports. If need be, a few interpretive
    stories could be appended. An established profile, such as that used by the
    local government&rsquo;s environmental protection agency, might be used in a standard
    form such as a cross-walk to the Dublin Core metadata standard, without
    dramatic loss of data.  </p>
  <p>It is unlikely, however, that such a standard material
    heritage management system would represent Quinkan culture as a whole or that
    it could replicate the kind of &lsquo;cultural doing&lsquo; taking place in real life. The
    focus on material artefacts is too narrow and does not encompass the wealth of
    human experience that makes up &lsquo;culture&rsquo;. The search for the future content of
    the Quinkan Matchbox is also a search for definitions for &rsquo;culture&lsquo; and
  &rsquo;heritage&lsquo; and what it might mean in the Quinkan community context. The common
    definitions of these terms have been in constant evolution, over time and
    across intellectual disciplines. These changing definitions in turn have had an
    impact on preservation practices and philosophies, as has the legal framework
    in which the preservation work takes place. Slowly, preservation practices are
    seeking to reflect and encapsulate indigenous views on matters of culture and
    heritage.</p>
  <p>Australian &lsquo;cultural heritage management&rsquo; was born in
    urgency, to preserve fast disappearing sites. It was administered in a
    bureaucratic style through the establishment of agencies attached to either
    museums or government departments (Byrne, 1991). Byrne feels that heritage
    values are still perceived as being 'in the field' rather than in communities.
    Definitions of content for the Quinkan Matchbox can be derived from a better
    understanding of the Indigenous view of &lsquo;heritage&rsquo; and the role
    played by archaeological sites within it. When Indigenous authors explain
    their world (or world view) to a wider, non-indigenous audience through writing,
    the central and recurring word is always &lsquo;Country&rsquo; (Rose, 1996;
    Sharp, 2002). Langton (1994) points to the necessity of understanding cultural
    landscapes. &ldquo;The concept of &lsquo;country&rsquo; embraces
    all the values, places, resources, stories and cultural obligations associated
    with the geographical area&quot; (p. 16). </p>
  <h2>A Technology-Driven Approach</h2>
  <p>Although our original aim was to write &lsquo;the&rsquo; Quinkan
    metadata application profile (MAP), it is clearer now this could only be one of
    many, modified and developed iteratively. In fact, the MAP is now offered as a
    base from which to define more local rules and imagine more facets to represent
    Quinkan culture. It is impossible to design a profile that is &lsquo;true to Country&rsquo;
    without engaging with the Country itself and its custodians. A real MAP needs
    community endorsement and the contribution of local terms and values. </p>
  <p>The Western agenda is well served by the building of large,
    interoperable networks of information and the increasing standardisation of
    knowledge representation. Indigenous preferences and demands are often
    obfuscated in this process. The Quinkan MAP is located at the intersection of
    two seemingly contradictory currents: global inter-operability and local
    specificity. Standards deal with these issues through internationalisation and
    localization, but these processes often work at cross-purposes (Duval et al., 2002). Global discovery is best served by internationalisation and the adoption of general conventions and terminology. Meanwhile, the needs of any community (be it a cultural or an intellectual community) are best served by the adoption of local conventions. This tension is familiar to the metadata community. </p>
  <h2>Cultural Property Rights</h2>
  <p>In his writing about the introduction of television in the
    Warlpiri community, Michaels (1986) noted that</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">kinship can also be thought of as a communication model. It
    establishes who will communicate to whom, around what issue and in which
    setting. A chart of a kinship system then can also be treated as a cybernetic
    model for information flows, accounting for the circulation of news and
    knowledge around the kin network (p. 8). </p>
  <p>By extension, a mapping of kinship in Laura could be modeled
    and form the base for the Quinkan Matchbox&rsquo;s rights and authentication sub-system,
    but again there is the problem of who would determine the model, and how? We
    know that this particular location&rsquo;s kinship system cannot be reduced to a
    simple flow chart, where the usual parameters, such as gender and age, provide
    the basic (and static) architecture for the authentication sub-system. Again,
    standard technological solutions are inadequate, and the best solution is
    likely to be a lot more complex and fluid than creating layers of
    authentication levels, as is often done in network administration.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Our experience in Australia with Quinkan culture has raised
    many questions for us. We cannot find models, examples, practices or principles
    that provide local satisfaction and global interoperability in ways that
    satisfy our goal of supporting the repatriation of Quinkan culture. We
    extrapolate from this experience, and others, to boldly suggest that in the
    current context, even with an abundance of technology and expertise, being
    technology driven is not the way. Community engagement is paramount. Working
    with people and from content is paramount. If this is recognised, then perhaps
    the technology might be built to suit the circumstances. </p>
  <p>Museums seem to have benefited in the past from the asset
    registrar way of recording information that prevailed, but many have more
    recently adopted the latest fashion in technology to produce new exhibition
    forms from what they already have. Local knowledge is often an afterthought, to
    establish provenance or meaning. Too often there is a split between
    technological capability and rapport with the community. </p>
  <p>When there is work of the quality and nature of the
    recording exemplified by Victor Steffensen, there is an opportunity for the
    technology to contribute in new ways. Victor, as a community agent, can
    accumulate content and understanding of the culture but needs the highest level
    of technological support to realize his unique contribution in the long term. </p>
  <p>Just because we can&rsquo;t find good models does not mean it
    can&rsquo;t be done. Possibly the problem is that the people who do the work, and
    spend the money, do it from the laboratory, not from within the community.
    Perhaps, the issue is not about finding new models of requirements gathering,
    or MAP making, for example, but new models of working with communities. </p>
