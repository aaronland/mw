  <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
  <p class="abstractText">This paper highlights the power of Web 2.0 tools and
    services to transform museum visitors' experiences from passive viewing events
    into interactive, empowering and inspiring educational opportunities. On-line
    collaboration tools &ndash; such as those for blogging, podcasting and image sharing
    &ndash; are transforming museum visitors into active on-line contributors. When
    empowered to construct their own narratives in response to museum exhibits,
    visitors establish new connections to the exhibit content. Beyond expected
    content synthesis, these immersive activities stimulate learning in the
    affective domain. The participation in collaborative narrative activities
    engenders creative, independent analysis, promoting learner self-efficacy and a
    personal connection with exhibit subject matter that is unparalleled in more
    traditional and passive approaches. Both this kind of participatory
    storytelling and the educational impact of adopting a collaborative framework
    are presented through two case studies &ndash; The <em>Franklin Remixed</em> and The<em> Art of Storytelling</em>. </p>
  <p class="abstractText">Engaged with in this immersive
    way, museum artifacts become rich sources of innovation and personal growth.
    Follow-up studies are indicated to examine the impact of creative &quot;Remixes&quot; on
    self-efficacy and innovative thinking skills.</p>

    <h2 class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Author's Note</h2>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Growing up in Philadelphia, the historical
        cradle of the United States, this author and his peers developed a barely
        palpable yet inescapable disdain for America's founding fathers. Unaware
        of the origins of this resistance at the time, the author today can clearly
        see how the stilted, celebratory and altogether unrealistic narrative
        that historians, tour guides and teachers wove around such greats as
        Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin made these icons seem all too
        unapproachable. What could middle school children, with all of their
        prepubescent insecurity, have in common with these mythic figures? </p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">When <em>The Franklin Remix</em> project began &ndash; a
      project in which middle school students remixed artifacts and narratives
      from two museum exhibitions about Benjamin Franklin &ndash; we detected
      in the students this very same contempt toward arguably the most famous
      of the founding fathers. Freed from the constraints of the textbook narrative
      through the exposure to exhibits providing a rich and well-rounded view
      of Franklin, students immediately gravitated to the faults and cracks in
      this great man's character. While many focused on the fact that Franklin
      was a slave owner, others explored his prejudices against Germans. One
      student seemed preoccupied with his renown as a womanizer. Collectively,
      students proclaimed that Ben was no saint. Guidance from the teaching team
      combined with each student's own free exploration of these shortcomings
      made Franklin human in their eyes. The students were able to come through
      the experience with a new-found respect and affinity for Ben. Suddenly,
      students saw Franklin as a real, and still great, man. Equally important
      were students' abilities to express this new-found admiration in their
      own words, through a Web site that they had authored themselves. It is
      this transformative visitor experience that we as museum professionals
      aspire to facilitate.</p>

    <h2 style='page-break-after:auto'>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Museums have shifted radically in recent years from having a
      focus on collections to being focused on their visitors. But some observers,
      such as philosopher and cultural critic Hilde S. Hein, would say that being
      visitor-centric is not enough. In Hein's 2006 book <em>Public Art: Thinking
        Museums Differently</em>, she argues effectively that a compelling model for
      museums <em>of all kinds</em> is that of a forum for public art. She
      characterizes public art not as the traditional concept of art staged in the
      public domain, but public art in a broader sense. While Hein devotes much of
      her book to defining public art, we will attempt to summarize her public art
      definition in a sentence: Hein's definition of public art in the museum context
      is the creation of new cultural objects and knowledge through a transformative
      process involving public engagement with museum collections and exhibits. The
      inclusion of the public in the creative process is key here, and it is this
      inclusion that sets Hein's definition apart from other visitor-centric ones.
      Many museums, particularly science centers and cultural heritage institutions,
      have employed both public interaction on the one hand, and narrative techniques
      on the other to successfully promote visitor-oriented experiences. While such
      methods provide key insights into the concept of museums as stages for public
      art, these methods do not strike at the heart of it, which is this: Public art,
      as Hein defines it, requires the public's involvement &quot;by means of an aesthetic
      interaction&#8230; [A] reaction is crucial to the work's actualization.&quot; (2006, 49-50)
      This &quot;<em>aesthetic interaction</em>&quot; qualifies as an affective experience for
      the visitor. In this sense all museums, from art to science centers, cultural
      heritage to historical sites, are considered forums for the creation of public
      art. </p>
    <p>Hein suggests that in creating forums for public art, Museum
      curators act as public artists, curating experiences that inspire and engage
      the public. If we accept Hein's model, then we must welcome visitors not
      only as the center of the experience, but also as active participants on
      the museal stage. Through our collaborations with visitors, we as museum
      professionals promote this interactive experience. While there are many
      forms for such collaborations, we discuss in this paper the concept of
      the exhibition remix &ndash;
      the remix as a technology-facilitated &quot;constructivist&quot; approach
      to the visitor experience, in which visitors are supported in creating
      their own original narrative drawing from the larger context of the exhibition
      narratives. Remixing both instructs and supports visitors in their quests
      to construct meaning and also inspires a personal and lasting connection
      with objects in museums.</p>
    <p>In our current information age we are overwhelmed with media
      from every screen. Meaning and knowledge rarely are simply transferred:
      they are actively constructed &ndash; in fact, must be so-constructed in
      order to be learned. Modes of digitally constructing knowledge have become
      the norm in this 21<sup>st</sup> century. Searching, tagging, and sharing
      allow the greater population the opportunity to actively construct and
      organize knowledge. Micro-casting, collaborating and remixing information
      and culture have allowed us the constructivist means of understanding our
      complex world. The future relevance of museums is threatened if museums
      do not open themselves to these new modes of knowledge construction. If
      museums are agents for creating public art and cultural understanding and
      not simply repositories of authoritative collections, then we as museum
      professionals have a responsibility to share collections in ways that allow
      visitors to engage with objects more meaningfully, out of which a subjective,
      relevant and potentially inspirational experience is born.</p>
    <p>How do we do this? One approach is to allow visitors to
      construct and present their own narratives using easily accessible
      technologies. This participatory approach brings museums into greater relevancy
      in two key ways. First, by encouraging individualized constructive experiences,
      we allow visitors to connect with collections in ways that are personally
      meaningful. Inviting visitors to become active learners promotes the museum and
      its mission, its collections and its curatorial aims. Second, by involving
      visitors in an actively constructive experience we both exercise and promote
      knowledge construction skills &ndash; the creative assimilation and
      re-contextualization of information into a coherent narrative framework that
      uniquely reflects a visitor's viewpoint. While the latter goal might not be as
      central to the missions of our museums, we suggest here that, &quot;Who, if not
      museums, are best positioned to promote it?&quot; We as museum professionals
      construct meaning out of vast bodies of knowledge and collections in order to
      present compelling narratives to our visitors. Shouldn't we pass along these
      same valuable storytelling skills to our visitors, skills that are so vital to
      understanding the world today?</p>
    <p>We will explore two case studies that represent distinct yet
      similar approaches to remixing exhibits, using on-line tools to create new
      narratives, in an effort to understand this approach and determine its
      efficacy. The first example is The <em>Franklin Remixed</em> project, in which a
      class of middle school students remixed two museum exhibits about Benjamin
      Franklin into their own on-line exhibit. The second case study is The<em> Art of
        Storytelling</em>, a two-part project, in which visitor-crafted stories inspired
      by works of art are podcast in the museum. Following this first Art of
      Storytelling project phase, an interactive, kiosk-based activity allowed
      visitors to create their own visual narratives and record accompanying audio
      stories. While the latter of these two projects just began in the winter of
      2007, the first was evaluated after its completion in the spring of 2006 and
      was found to promote learning in both the cognitive and affective domains. </p>
    <p>We will briefly discuss how both of these projects share
      many parallels with the more general concept of student-created museums, an
      effective educational model in the museum education field. We also will point
      out features of these two projects that are distinctively different from other
      types of student-created museums, primarily in that they take advantage of
      on-line technologies. Web 2.0 technologies provide some key advantages for
      these projects, making them affordable, repeatable and universally accessible
      (inasmuch as the Internet is universal). In closing, we will discuss our
      observations about this constructivist type of approach, including some of the
      challenges and concerns that were raised, and discuss next steps and possible
      departure points for further research.</p>
    <h2>What is Remixing?</h2>
    <p>We define the remix as the process of understanding a body
      of knowledge by using technology to rearrange and recontextualize its elements
      in order to construct an original narrative. The origins of the concept of
      remixing dates back to the 1960s &ndash; to the early days of the Jamaican dub music
      of such obscure notables as King Tubby and Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry. According to
      John Von Seggern, ethnomusicologist at the University of California, Riverside,
      and author of the on-line exhibit &quot;Postdigital Remix Culture and On-line
      Performance&quot;, remixing was an &quot;art form of taking prerecorded rhythm tracks and
      rearranging them into a piece of music&quot; (Seggern, 2007).  While the roots of
      such musical forms can be found in the bardic tradition of the West African
      griots &ndash; oral storytellers whose influences continue to echo in hip-hop and
      popular music today &ndash; the key differentiator of the early dub remixes was the
      use of technology to facilitate this effect. Originally through mixing vinyl
      and tape loops &ndash; now largely done with purely digital technology &ndash; musicians
      have popularized an art form of recontextualizing and making meaning out of
      pre-existent, and often culturally alien, media. Though parallels of this
      approach exist in other art forms, from early 20<sup>th</sup> century montage
      in visual art to 19<sup>th</sup> century American quilting, Seggern suggests
      that &quot;[the musical remix] is a major conceptual leap: making
      music on a meta-structural level, drawing together and making sense of a much
      larger body of information by threading a continuous narrative through it.&quot; It
      is this definition that will inform our discussion of remixing in the context
      of the museum experience, as we are specifically interested in museums that inspire
      visitors to understand a sophisticated body of knowledge through the digital
      construction of their own unique or collaborative narrative. </p>
    <p>This remix or digitally constructivist approach &ndash; that of
      constructing our own narratives through surfing, searching, tagging and sharing
      &ndash; is becoming the dominant means by which we consume media, learn and
      communicate in an Internet-driven information age. We
      will not belabor the point that today's media overwhelm even the most
      culturally-absorbent person. And just when it seemed that the diverse and
      multitudinous corporate media sources found from TV to the Internet would
      engulf us, the recent rise of Web 2.0-facilitated micro-casting through blogs,
      podcasting, <em>YouTube</em> and more have exploded the number of our media outlets
      exponentially. But, as Seggern suggests, &quot;We have developed the technology for
      all to access massive quantities of information, yet our tools for handling,
      organizing, managing, and understanding these mountains of information have not
      developed accordingly...&quot; Those of us raised in a more prosaic media pasture of
      three networks and the local newspaper might simply choose to largely ignore
      the media glut, selecting a blog here or a podcast there to supplement our
      trusted media diet as if selecting a few exotic cheeses at the local fromagier.
      Many of us will not ignore the onslaught &ndash; certainly not members of the younger
      generation. This generation has embraced the media cornucopia in all of its
      channel-surfing, Google-driven, YouTube complexity. And more significant than
      accepting the quantity and complexity of new media is the shift from passive
      viewer or reader to active surfer, searcher, tagger. It is this active role
      that parallels that of the remixer &ndash; one who creates meaning by threading a narrative
      story &ndash; or journey &ndash; through complex information. Again, Seggern indicates that</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">The importance of this cannot be
      overstated: in an era of information overload, the art of remixing and sampling
      as practiced by hip-hop DJs and producers points to ways of working with
      information on higher levels of organization, pulling together the efforts of
      others into a multilayered multi-referential whole which is much more than the
      sum of its parts. (<a href="../http://ethnomus.ucr.edu/remix_culture/remix_history.htm" target="_blank">http://ethnomus.ucr.edu/remix_culture/remix_history.htm</a>)</p>
    <p>Those of us involved in museum curation and education, as
      well as interactive design, understand this kind of construction as a major
      aspect of what we do professionally. But to extend this construction beyond the
      role of the media and exhibit creators to the role of the museum visitors
      themselves is to allow visitors to share in the same rich creative learning
      process that we professionals experience. Pete Rojas (2002) points out that to</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">the teens buying the latest all-remixes J.Lo album&#8230; or
      even hacking together their own bootleg, recombination &ndash; whether
      legal or not &ndash; doesn't
      feel wrong in the slightest. The difference now is that they have the tools
      to sample, reference, and remix, allowing them to finally &lsquo;talk back'
      to pop culture in the way that seems most appropriate to them.</p>
    <p>According
      to Siva Vaidhyanthan, cultural historian, media scholar and the author of Copyrights and Copywrongs: The Rise of
      Intellectual Property and How it Threatens Creativity, </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">What we're seeing is the result of a democratization
      of creativity and the demystification of the process of authorship and
      creativity&#8230;
      It's about demolishing the myth that there has to be a special class of
      creators, and flattening out the creative curve so we can all contribute
      to our creative environment (in Rojas 2002).</p>
    <p>While it
      is not the purpose of this paper to explore the political and cultural debate
      surrounding copyright, it is important to acknowledge that we cannot employ
      these participatory approaches without confronting and redefining our notion of
      intellectual property and the concept of fair use. </p>
    <h2>Remixing as Public Art</h2>
    <p>Artists, from musicians to filmmakers, bloggers to writers,
      often see themselves as curators and remixers of media and culture. Beyond the
      well-known realm of hip-hop and popular music, the remix concept pervades
      modern media. A few examples include the notorious 2001 remix of the Star Wars
      movie <em>The Phantom Menace</em> entitled <em>The Phantom Edit</em>, in which an
      unknown fan uploaded to the Internet a version from which some 20 minutes were
      deleted out of the film. Critics raved that it was better than the original,
      though LucasFilms swiftly shut down the distribution of this unauthorized
      bootleg. Another wonderful and openly authorized remix example is that of the
      Internet music project <em>Redd Blood Cells </em>(<a href="../http://www.reddkross.com/features/RBC/main.html" target="_blank">http://www.reddkross.com/features/RBC/main.html</a>). 
      In 2002, amid the rising success of superstar rock'n'rollers The White Stripes,
      the bass-player of the rock band Redd Cross created a truly unique remix.
      Finding the Stripe's hit album <em>White Blood Cells</em> &ndash; with its sparse
      soundscape of vocals, guitar and drums &ndash; anemic to his ear (if you'll forgive
      the term), he mixed in his own bass lines and uploaded the entire record as &ndash;
      you guessed it &ndash; <em>Redd Blood Cells</em>. With over 60,000 downloads and
      write-ups in <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, it was
      an immediate remix hit. It is important to note that both of these works,
      unlike current commercial remixes, were freely-distributed forms of public art,
      with the Internet acting as the agent of their dissemination. </p>
    <p>According to Hein, &quot;The audience is no longer figured as
      passive onlooker but as participant, actively implicated in the constitution of
      the work of art&quot; (1996, 3). Let's take this concept of the remix as public art
      one step further. In our current culture's fixation on the
      user/visitor/audience, in short, the public, as the essential voice of our
      times, the very fundamental authorship of media has begun to shift. For
      example, the ingeniously hyped 2006 B-movie <em>Snakes on a Plane</em> took off on
      the Internet before it was even released, leading to viral videos, fan Web
      sites and blogs. According to a <em>New Yorker</em> article by David Denby (2006),</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Quickly, a giddy atmosphere
      developed on the Internet; the movie became the subject of songs, mock trailers,
      merchandising contests, Pennsylvania Dutch quilting bees. A typically profane
      Samuel L. Jackson line became an Internet joke even though it wasn't in the
      film. Well, it's in the film now. It was added when, in March, New Line, the
      production company, shot extra footage to juice up the thrills. </p>
    <p style='text-autospace:none'>Through a
      spontaneous outpouring of public participation and with the whole-hearted
      support of New Line Films, the public shifted from audience to participant in
      the storytelling itself. Similar acts of audience participation have been
      long-rumored about such popular yet open-ended television shows as ABC's <em>LOST</em>,
      where staff writers are rumored to lurk and even post anonymously on fan sites
      in an effort to tie-up loose plot threads and determine the fates of less popular
      characters. While many television shows actively promote participation through
      real-time polling, e-mails and call-ins, at least one show has taken this one
      step further. The brand new Finnish TV show <em>Accidental Lovers</em> allows the
      audience to control the outcome of each episode via mobile phone text messages, according to an <em>Engadget</em> article by Cyrus
      Farivar. These
      high-visibility participatory narrative projects clearly are just the tip of
      the iceberg. The success of such projects in part can be attributed to the
      sense of ownership and identification that the public gains by being included
      in the process of shaping the narrative. It is just this sort of subjective
      identification on the part of the audience or visitor with artwork, collections
      and exhibits, that museums have a vested interest in engendering. When museum
      collections are demystified through the presentation of non-authoritative
      narratives, the visitor is invited to engage with objects on a personal, and
      potentially inspirational, level.</p>
    <p>In the words of renowned musician/producer Brian Eno in an
      interview with <em>Wired Magazine</em> (quoted in Kelly 1995):</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">An artist is now a curator. An artist is now much more seen
      as a connector of things, a person who scans the enormous field of possible
      places for artistic attention, and says, What I am going to do is draw your
      attention to this sequence of things&#8230; This is why the curator, the editor, the
      compiler, and the anthologist have become such big figures. They are all people
      whose job it is to digest things, and to connect them together. </p>
    <p> Likewise, we argue that a curator
      is reciprocally an artist &ndash; and a remix artist at that. Again, it is important
      to emphasize that this applies to all curators, not simply curators of arts
      collections. In Hein's words (2006, 76-77), </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Today's public artists incline to
      replace answers with questions. They seek to advance debate and discussion.
      Their art is left open-ended and invites participation. Its orientation is
      toward process and change rather than material stability. Since its borders are
      indefinite, so is its authorship.</p>
    <h2>Museums as Forums for Public Art</h2>
    <p>In <em>Public Art: Thinking Museums Differently</em>, Hein builds on her earlier scholarship in an effort to
      redefine museums of all kinds as community-focused stewards of public art. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">My approach to the museum in terms of a public rather than
      private form of art&#8230; is meant to underscore the quality that the museum itself
      now chooses to emphasize, namely, its concern with the public interest (2006,
      139).</p>
    <p>She
      discusses how &quot;[Museums] are striving to reach new audiences, but that goal is
      coupled with the more fundamental objective to redefine themselves. &lsquo;From being
      about something to being for somebody'.&quot; (2006, 125) Here, Hein is quoting
      Stephen Weil, former deputy director of the Smithsonian Institution's
      Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and emeritus senior scholar at the
      Smithsonian Institution's Center for Museum Studies.</p>
    <p>Hein acknowledges that museums are
      shifting from the collections-based, curator-narrated experience to a
      visitor-centric experience in which the visitor has a voice: &quot;The monotonous
      voice of authority, long associated with didactic schooling and the
      conventional curator-interpreted museum, has given way to visitor-centered
      museums, with options that encourage the public to create meaning.&quot; (2006, 113)
      She also acknowledges the current trend of deemphasizing museum objects in
      favor of storytelling: &quot;Decentering the revered object to foreground narrative
      instead, [museums] focused on techniques to tell and distribute stories,
      loudly, diversely, and dramatically.&quot; (2006, 119). She identifies the very real
      concern about how effective museums can be in this market arena when &quot;they are
      no match against well-funded media or Disneyland.&quot; (2006, 119) Instead, Hein
      emphasizes what she sees as the primary power and responsibility of museums;
      that is, to inspire the transformative experience that visitors have when they
      are confronted with an object. </p>
    <p>Hein refers to this transformative
      connection between visitor and object, inspiring in the visitor &quot;the
      occasional and momentary feeling that things are right with the world&quot;,
      as &quot;the museal
      gaze&quot; (2006, 118). &quot;[Museums'] much underestimated strength is
      not in their yarns but in the capacity to inspire the museal gaze&#8230;&quot; (2006,
      119). Clearly visitor-centric exhibition narratives are not enough, but
      rather museum experiences which promote visitors to construct their own
      narrative are required. In thus defining museums as forums for public art,
      she urges them beyond visitor-centricity toward a more vibrant environment
      in which transformative experiences can occur. She quotes Philip Rhys Adams
      in saying that the museum is &quot;the controlling intermediary who sets
      the scene&#8230; then bids
      the actors take the stage and be their best artistic selves&quot; (2006,
      111). These actors, the objects, the curators <strong>and<em> </em></strong>the
      visitors, create a much more dynamic experience. In this context, being
      our best artistic selves is seen as being creative, constructive participants
      in defining our narrative(s) through the curated museum experience. </p>
    <p>One means of fostering these
      participatory museum experiences is the use of digital technologies. While she
      does not explicitly investigate on-line narrative techniques, Hein discusses
      the use of digital storytelling techniques that allow visitors to construct
      meaning virtually: &quot;[T]he &lsquo;virtual museum' can be an avenue to information
      exchange unformatted by the authoritative voice of the museum. &lsquo;Virtual
      visitors'&#8230; can freely rearrange their downloaded treasure and shape it into
      &lsquo;collections' of their own devising, however and in the company of whomever
      they like (2006, 117).&quot;</p>
    <h2>The Educational Efficacy of Museum Remixes</h2>
    <p>Museum remix projects are constructivist in nature, allowing
      for the optimal scenario of transformative learning experiences. In looking to
      understand this formula for learning, it is helpful to refer to Linda D'Acquisto's 2006 book, <em>Learning on
        Display: Student-Created Museums That Build Understanding</em>. In this practical guide
      to student-created exhibits as educational devices, D'Acquisto discusses the
      advantages of such a transformative learning approach. First, she offers that
      &quot;&#8230;when students were presented with a genuine problem, they were motivated by
      the task itself, not by the promise of getting good grades or obtaining other
      external rewards&#8230;&quot; (2006, xi). This motivational factor is key in appreciating
      the success of such participatory learning activities. She goes on to describe
      the benefits to the affective domain, such as problem-solving and confidence in
      their creative skills. She says, </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">&#8230;students were driven by a sense of personal and shared
      responsibility for what they were creating. As students were building their
      museum, something special happened &ndash; they not only developed their
      knowledge of content but also gained a better understanding of their strengths
      and potential (2006, xii).</p>
    <p>She reinforces this personal
      transformation by stating that &quot;successful school museum projects&#8230; provide
      students with meaningful, powerful, and memorable learning experiences that
      demand intellectual <span class="StyleHelveticaItalicBlack">and</span> creative effort&quot; (2006, xii).</p>
    <p>D'Acquisto identifies the key
      learning areas addressed in student-created exhibits (2006, 6-7):</p>
    <p>Students</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Help define what they will learn.</li>
    <li>Acquire new knowledge by summarizing, analyzing, and synthesizing
      information from various sources to answer questions.</li>
    <li>Learn skills such as research, writing, and design to acquire and
      represent their knowledge.</li>
    <li>Collaborate with their peers, teachers, and community as they
      learn.</li>
    <li>Use their knowledge to create a product &ndash; a visual and
      written representation of what they have learned.</li>
    <li>Communicate what they have learned to an audience
      other than their classroom teacher.</li>
	  </ul>
    <p>Students [will learn]</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information and communication skills (information and media
      literacy; communication skills)</li>
    <li> Thinking and problem-solving skills (critical thinking and
      systems thinking; problem identification, formulation, and solution; creativity
      and intellectual curiosity)</li><li>Interpersonal and self-directional skills (interpersonal and
      collaborative skills; self-direction; accountability and adaptability; social
      responsibility)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>D'Acquisto is clear in
      differentiating museum exhibition projects from more typical science fairs and
      collaborative learning exercises. In doing so she describes the key
      differentiator: &quot;School museum exhibits (like their professional counterparts)
      present displays that tell a coherent &lsquo;story'&quot; (2006, 12). It is student-led
      participatory storytelling that distinguishes a museum exhibition from other
      collaborative educational experiences. </p>
    <p>The museum exhibition remix
      projects described herein have much in common with D'Acquisto's model of
      student-created museums &ndash; particularly in that they are participatory
      narratives created by the public (or a segment of the public: in her case,
      school children) for the public. In addition, these projects represent
      collaborations among the museum or subject matter experts, educators, and the
      public or visitors. There are some crucial differentiators among the projects
      described in this paper and classically-defined student-created museums,
      however. First, exhibition remixes are based on museum object collections and
      exhibit narratives, and as such reflect the expertise and authenticity of the
      collaborating museum curators. Second, the remix projects are facilitated using
      Internet-based, easily accessible tools and media. Such accessibility greatly
      enhances these tools' applicability in a museum education context. Rather than
      semester-long projects requiring exhaustive classroom time and resources,
      on-line remix projects can be completed in months, weeks &ndash; sometimes hours. The
      other key factor is that the product of on-line exhibition remix projects,
      unlike their location-based, school-specific counterparts, is universal. Anyone
      with Internet access can visit, interact with and even respond to these virtual
      exhibits.</p>
    <h2>Two Museum Remix Projects</h2>
    <p>Two projects completed in 2006 reflect the highly
      participatory &quot;remix&quot; approach to constructing narratives in response to museum
      exhibits and collections. The first, The <em>Franklin Remixed</em> project
      (referred to as &quot;<em>Remix</em>,&quot;) was completed in the spring of 2006. In
      conjunction with this project we conducted an evaluation of its educational
      efficacy, the results of which appear below. The second project, The<em> Art of
        Storytelling</em> project (referred to as &quot;<em>Storytelling,&quot;)</em> launched in
      December of 2006, and has not yet been evaluated. </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="fisher.fig2.jpg" alt="Fig 2: Middle school student completing the Art of Storytelling kiosk exercise in which she will write and record the voiceover for her own story. Delaware Art Museum, Wilmington, DE, December, 2006" width="400" height="300" /></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2: Middle school student completing the Art of
      Storytelling kiosk exercise in which she will write and record the voiceover
      for her own story. Delaware Art Museum, Wilmington, DE, December, 2006</p>
    <p>Both projects utilize Web 2.0 tools to support
      visitor-authored original narratives inspired by objects in the museums. In the
      case of <em>Remix</em>, students authored their own exhibition themes, skits and
      label copy. In <em>Storytelling</em>, visitors wrote their own short stories
      inspired by works of art &ndash; stories which were then recorded and podcast in the
      gallery space, allowing others to experience the visitors' own non-authoritative,
      original narratives. Both projects allow visitors to search, select and remix
      museum objects in their own way. In <em>Remix,</em> students selected and wrote
      about artifacts that supported their chosen themes, and then recontextualized
      artifacts through image-editing tools to create mock film posters and cartoons.
      In <em>Storytelling,</em> visitors compose images of subjects, backgrounds and
      props drawn from museum artwork, to which they then narrate their own audio
      stories. The projects differ in that the <em>Remix</em> project took place
      largely in the classroom, and as such was a more comprehensive educational
      exercise. We found this format was more appropriate for producing a
      transformative experience around complex and nuanced cultural heritage subject
      matter. The <em>Storytelling</em> project occurs primarily in the gallery space,
      and as such acts as an inspirational springboard for narrative musings. We felt
      this format was more likely to inspire moments such as those described by Hein
      in her definition of &quot;the museal gaze&quot;. In the words of Delaware Art Museum
      Executive Director Danielle Rice in her recent article in the Delaware News
      Journal, &quot;What makes art really sparkle is the creative energy that we as
      viewers bring to it when we really open ourselves up to the experience.&quot;</p>

    <h2>A Closer Look: The <em>Franklin Remixed</em></h2>
    <p>In 2005, four Philadelphia institutions &ndash; The Benjamin
      Franklin Tercentenary, The Rosenbach Museum and Library, The University of the
      Arts, and Night Kitchen Interactive &ndash; joined together to design an inventive
      educational program using two Franklin-based exhibitions &ndash; the Tercentenary's <em>Benjamin
        Franklin: In Search of a Better World</em> and the Rosenbach's <em>Poor Richards:
          Anatomy of an Almanac</em>.  We created an educational project using
      collaborative multimedia tools to deepen students' understanding of Benjamin
      Franklin and his shaping of the American republic and character, with the
      ultimate goal of inspiring the students to admire and adopt some of Franklin's
      civic-mindedness.</p>

    <p>The <em>Franklin Remixed</em> project (<a
href="../http://www.franklinremixed.com/" target="_blank">http://www.franklinremixed.com</a>) was
      an on-line exhibit designed &quot;for Middle School Students by Middle School
      Students&quot;, in which students constructed a collaborative narrative exhibit in
      their own voice. Through the guided use of blogging (WordPress.com), podcasting
      (Slapcast.com) and image sharing (Flickr.com) tools in a classroom environment,
      students conceived their exhibit's &quot;big idea,&quot; established interpretative
      themes, and composed &quot;label copy&quot; for selected artifacts. They published
      images, produced audio narratives and dramatic skits, and composed personal
      reflection pages. </p>

    <p>Both direct and indirect measures, along with anecdotal
      evidence, strongly suggest that the participatory <em>Franklin Remixed</em> project experiences contribute to the development of the learner's creativity
      and self-efficacy. Each learner's purposeful adaptation of Franklin artifacts
      draws upon creative capabilities to redeploy (and thus revitalize) the cultural
      meanings of the material. When engaged with in this way, museum artifacts
      become rich sources of innovation and personal growth. This kind of growth can
      become the focus of follow-up studies regarding the ways in which creative &lsquo;Remixes'
      promote among middle school students the development of self-efficacy and the
      skills associated with innovative thinking.</p>
    <h2>The <em>Franklin Remixed</em> Project
      Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Our goals for the evaluation component of the <em>Franklin
      Remixed</em> project were to produce a model museum education program for
      cross-disciplinary learning that takes into account multiple intelligences and
      a variety of learning styles. We sought to provide a group of middle school
      students with a creative and innovative way to learn about Benjamin Franklin
      and his role in early American history, and to foster critical and interpretive
      skills for students to better communicate the essence of Benjamin Franklin. We
      also thought that by introducing students to the basic concepts of developing a
      museum exhibition and the fundamental principles of on-line exhibition design
      through the use of on-line communication tools, they could assimilate and
      present their ideas in an organized, logical and creative manner using
      interactive tools to communicate and illustrate a collaborative narrative about
      Franklin.</p>
    <p>Research was conducted at a series of checkpoints to
      determine base knowledge, to assess learning over time, and to determine the
      final impact of the exhibition and the Mini-course on student learning. The
      evaluation project tested differences and similarities between the control
      group (75 middle school students who did not take the Mini-course) and the 15
      students who did.</p>
    <p>Results indicate that intensive interdisciplinary and
      multi-media activities supplementing field trip experiences constitute a
      successful method for enhancing content acquisition and affective change in
      middle school students.  </p>
    <h3>Control Group Results</h3>
    <p>In evaluating the program against six content goals, it is
      clear that all of The Philadelphia School students began with more previous
      content knowledge than one might expect of middle school students. Nonetheless,
      the visits to the two exhibitions were instrumental in knowledge procurement
      for all students in four of the goals: Franklin's scientific, writing, civic,
      and political achievements. Also, the students' perception of Franklin as a
      smart and influential person in American history was increased by the field
      trip experiences. Students began to see how Franklin may have influenced their
      own lives, especially through his inventions, but few were moved to see that
      they themselves could emulate Franklin's diplomacy, inventiveness, or
      intellectual curiosity. Those aspects of the exhibits that tried to make these
      abstract points, in general, were not well understood, and three months after
      the field trips, while specific content gains were maintained, there were no
      long-term affective gains for the control group.</p>
    <h3>Experimental Group Results</h3>
    <p>Mini-course students, on the other hand, not only maintained
      their content knowledge, but some of them also became inspired by Franklin's
      actions and could begin to identify personally with his traits. At the
      end of the project, they indicated they did not think they learned major
      new facts about Franklin, but they clearly now understood nuances of and
      context for his life. While at the beginning of the project, students had
      wanted to explore what they identified as the less flattering aspects of
      Franklin's actions and views, by the project's end, the Mini-course students
      said that they now saw how Franklin had been a product of his times and
      that he was able to grow and change his opinion over his lifetime. This
      capacity for personal transformation was perhaps the most inspiring quality
      that students saw in Franklin, in contrast to the anticipated goals of
      inspiring civic activism and diplomatic qualities.</p>
    <p>In addition to enhancing knowledge and inspiring
      Franklin-like qualities, Mini-course students saw positive results in
      understanding how to glean cultural information from objects, how to create an
      exhibit, and how to use Web 2.0 technology. The blending of subject matter
      learning with the mastering of new communication tools (so that the information
      could be shared with other students) deepened these middle school students'
      understanding of the subject and engendered a deep pride in their own teaching
      abilities. While the course was by no means perfect, and the students provided
      insightful comments on how to improve it, the overall project is seen as a
      success by the students, teachers, and adult facilitators. </p>
    <h3>Evaluation Summary</h3>
    <p>From the evaluation it is clear that while project
      participation enhanced knowledge of substantive Franklin-related content, the
      project's main contributions consisted of </p>
    <ol>
      <li>helping students form a more nuanced understanding of Franklin, </li>
      <li>fostering a greater sense of personal identification with Franklin; </li>
      <li>learning about object study and exhibition process, and </li>
      <li>managing new technology as a tool for learning subject matter.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The evaluation clearly indicated
      that participatory narrative exercises supplementing exhibition field trip
      experiences constitute a successful method for enhancing content acquisition
      and affective change in middle school students. Evaluation participants not
      only maintained content knowledge, but also became inspired by Franklin's
      actions and identified personally with his traits. In addition, these students
      understood how to glean cultural information from objects, how to create an
      exhibition narrative, and how to use Web 2.0 technology to share their findings
      with the world. The blending of subject matter learning with mastering new
      communication tools for sharing the information deepened their understanding of
      the subject and engendered a deep pride in their teaching abilities.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This paper explored the concept of museum remixes in the
      context of understanding museums as forums for public art. We have defined the
      concept of the remix as using technology to recontextualize a body of knowledge
      and create an authentic, unique narrative. We briefly explored the origins of
      the remix and its evolution from a musical form to a more general concept of
      participatory, constructivist art form. In hopes of inspiring further action,
      we have discussed the viability of the remix as a form of public art, and
      argued that such a form of public art is appropriate for the museum setting. We
      have reinforced the educational efficacy of this participatory approach in the
      greater context of museum education and constructivist learning techniques
      through two case studies, The <em>Franklin Remixed</em> and The <em>Art of
        Storytelling </em>projects. </p>
    <p>Evaluation data from The <em>Franklin Remixed</em> project
      shows the efficacy of the remix in enhancing subject matter acquisition and
      affective change in learners. Further research is required into the educational
      efficacy of the <em>Art of Storytelling</em> project, as well as gaining a better
      understanding of the implications of democratizing the museal voice and
      experience while maintaining the high standards and rich tradition of the
      museum community.</p>
