    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm is one of Sweden&rsquo;s
      largest museums and a national museum with responsibility for the whole
      country. The museum forms part of a central museums agency called the National
      Historical Museums (SHMM). This also includes the Royal Coin Cabinet and
      Tumba Papermill Museum. The agency employs a total of approximately 80
      people. The Museum of National Antiquities&rsquo; collections comprise
      archaeological artefacts from Sweden and Swedish ecclesiastical art. The
      collections contain more than 20 million individual objects catalogued
      under around 34,000 inventory numbers. Great efforts are underway in the
      museum to digitise the collections. The collections database is an internal
      tool which can also be accessed by the public on the Web. The Museum of
      National Antiquities&rsquo; exhibitions display thousands of years of history
      from ancient prehistory to the Viking period and the Middle Ages. The Museum
      of National Antiquities identified the Internet as an important tool for
      achieving its obligations towards the public early on, and was one of Sweden&rsquo;s
      first museums to have a Web presence (1995). Recruiting new professional
      staff from outside the museum sector has revitalised old structures. The
      strategic importance of the Web site in terms of reaching out across the
      whole country has constantly grown, as has its importance in terms of marketing
      and for teaching purposes. Today the Web site also reaches outside Sweden&rsquo;s
      borders, with 30 percent of traffic coming from abroad. In 2004 work began
      to update the Web site to make the museum&rsquo;s Web-based communications
      more efficient and integrate the whole museum in the Web project. Extensive
      user tests, workshops, interviews and a preliminary study launched the
      project throughout the organisation. In autumn 2006 a Web site editorial
      team comprising eight people &ndash; plus a general IT manager &ndash; was
      producing material for the Web site. 2006 saw the start of the major Web
      project with the overall aim of creating a Web site for the public with
      high accessibility and a long lifetime. The method chosen is to delegate
      publication responsibility and content management to staff in different
      departments of the museum. The reasoning behind this is that with today&rsquo;s
      simplified technology, it was considered that it was now possible to move
      away from centralised publication. Developing and creating support for
      a new work model is an important part of the Web project. The Web site
      will become a powerful instrument in implementing structural organisational
      changes, work which will have a positive impact on the museum&rsquo;s organisational
      development. Staff with expertise in different spheres and from different
      departments are now working together more openly and with respect for each
      others&rsquo; professional roles. Questions concerning our approach to
      history and the way it is told affect and are discussed by everyone at
      the museum. A greater commonality of approach at the museum is achieved
      through training initiatives, departments working together and documented
      guidelines. The new Web site went public on 26 January 2007. The museum
      now has a powerful platform for the future and a Web organisation with
      the full support of everyone at the museum. The museum&rsquo;s work on
      user-focused Web services will continue. </p>
    <h1>Background</h1>
    <h2>User Tests </h2>
    <p>In 2004 the museum carried out a large number of user tests of the museum&rsquo;s
      Web site. It was tested by target groups of teachers, visitors to the museum,
      tourists, pupils, new Swedes and senior citizens. The results demonstrated
      a major need for improvements. Visitors to the Web site were not seen as
      the focus of the information. Instead the information was provided from
      the point of view of the museum organisation. The Web site contained a
      great many pages; many were out of date, and users found the site hard
      to navigate. Nor was the Web site capable of complying with the accessibility
      requirements (WCAG 1.0) laid down for Swedish agencies. The museum took
      the results on board and continued with an in-depth preliminary study of
      the Web site&rsquo;s content. </p>
    <h2>Preliminary Study</h2>
    <p>A preliminary study of restructuring the content of the Web site was carried
      out in 2005. The entire Web site with its then compact 3,000 pages was
      examined. Internet statistics and the user tests were analysed in depth.
      The observations made during the preliminary study indicated that the way
      the information was structured was not clear. Attention was also drawn
      to the prevailing method of working with the Web site. This depended on
      the expertise and input of a few people for updates and publication (one
      full-time Web editor and from time to time a part-time e-learning officer).
      Providing information for the Web site was a low priority at the museum,
      and the Web site was often the last stage of the production chain. Active
      work to develop the Web site was not possible under these conditions.</p>
    <p>The preliminary study culminated in a proposal for a new information structure
      for the Web site content and a recommendation that the content of the static
      Web site be transferred to a Content Management System.</p>
    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>As its Content Management System the museum chose EPiServer, the market
      leader in the Nordic Countries, which is used in the public and private
      sectors. Several factors contributed towards this decision. One crucial
      factor was that the National Historical Museums shares its IT environment
      with a number of other agencies. Together with these agencies, a joint
      analysis and procurement project for a suitable Web platform was carried
      out. The museum was able to benefit from the development work carried out
      by the other agencies before it started out on its own. A great deal of
      money was saved on Web site development costs in this respect and the museum
      was able to learn from the other agencies&rsquo; mistakes. </p>
    <p>The choice of platform marked the start of the museum&rsquo;s own Web
      project. In retrospect, we could have started the Web project far earlier.
      To a certain extent the organisation had inaccurate expectations of what
      an IT solution could achieve.</p>
    <h2>Workshops</h2>
    <p>Earlier interviews with staff in the museum showed that there was a need
      among employees to discuss basic questions such as the museum&rsquo;s goal
      and vision, since these influence work with the collections and exhibitions
      as well as work on the Web site. The museum realised that the Web project
      would not be simply about developing and implementing a new Web site. Achieving
      a living and dynamic Web site demanded a different kind of organisation
      and different ways of working. The technical platform in itself fulfils
      a supporting function but requires a suitable work model if it is to be
      used optimally. </p>
    <p>With this in mind, workshops were planned on the museum&rsquo;s new Web
      site, its content, and its design. About ten members of staff from the
      museum&rsquo;s different departments were invited to take part in three
      workshops headed by the IT consultants who would then develop and program
      the Web site. </p>
    <p>The introductory workshop discussed the museum&rsquo;s goal and vision
      for the Web site in the future. Goals regarding accessibility and usefulness
      were laid down. This meant that all participants had a common foundation
      for their ongoing work together. </p>
    <p>The next workshop was about examining existing ways of working and workflows
      and producing a more efficient model based on the new technical platform.
      Delegating the editing and publication work was the obvious solution. Making
      this choice means that subject experts produce the content for the Web
      site&rsquo;s various editors in the museum (departmental editors) who adapt
      it for the Web site and publish the content in pictures and text. One overall
      Web site manager is responsible for continuous quality assurance. </p>
    <p>The final workshop was about looking at good examples of Web sites chosen
      by the participants themselves from the world of museums and the world
      of business. The discussions led to a lot of wishes for functions and services
      in the new Web site. These were brought together in a wishlist of functions
      which the project participants were charged with prioritising.</p>
    <p>It was important to the Web project that staff from all the museum&rsquo;s
      departments take part in these workshops. The workshops proved to be a
      successful way of gaining support for the Web project throughout the organisation.</p>
    <h1>Project Design</h1>
    <h2>Specification of Requirements</h2>
    <p>The Web project had a limited budget, making it important to prioritise
      the items on the wishlist. Priorities were determined in conjunction with
      the specification of requirements. It turned out that the budget would
      run to a durable Web platform for the future and a Web site with fundamental
      and excellent solutions for searches, a calendar, accessibility, film,
      and integration with the museum&rsquo;s collections database. Budgetary
      restrictions meant that some functionality had to be postponed to a second
      phase in the future. The total number of items on the wishlist which the
      specification of requirements had to consider came partly from user tests
      of the old Web site and partly from interdepartmental workshops with the
      museum&rsquo;s staff.</p>
    <p>Throughout the Web project the specification of requirements was actively
      and constantly used as basic underlying documentation by the members of
      the project team. The specification of requirements is exhaustive and describes
      the information structure and the structure of the pages with skeleton
      outlines, functions, page types and examples of main design features. </p>
    <h2>Staffing the Project</h2>
    <p>The Swedish Government charged the Swedish National Council for Cultural
      Affairs with making a major investment in employment measures in the cultural
      sector in 2006 and 2007. The project, which was given the name Access,
      has the aim of improving the work of preserving collections and other archives
      and making them more accessible throughout the cultural sector. The Access
      project means that agencies and cultural institutions receive financial
      assistance enabling them to employ highly trained and qualified staff.
      This employment measure came at an ideal time for the major restructuring
      of the museum&rsquo;s Web site. Thanks to Access the museum was able to
      recruit additional expertise for the major Web project: an e-learning officer,
      three Web editors, a media producer, and a language consultant. </p>
    <h1>The Web Site <br />
      (http://www.shmm.se)</h1>
    <p>As part of the preparations for the extensive work of redesigning the
      Museum of National Antiquities&rsquo; Web site, the Web project began by
      creating a completely new Web site for the agency the National Historical
      Museums (SHMM). The agency had not previously had its own Web site as information
      provided by it was embedded in the Museum of National Antiquities&rsquo; Web
      site. Creating a new Web site for the agency meant that the Museum of National
      Antiquities&rsquo; Web site could become a Web site designed for the public
      while SHMM&rsquo;s responsibilities and obligations towards the ministry
      and the Government were better clarified by a separate Web site. </p>
    <p>The agency&rsquo;s Web site, unlike the museum&rsquo;s Web site, is very
      limited in terms of its content and scope. The Web site could be produced
      in the space of a few months and contains information intended for other
      institutions and officers in the culture sector. It contains letters of
      appropriations, reports, annual reports, guidelines and research programmes,
      for example. </p>
    <p>As the agency&rsquo;s Web site concerns all three of the museums encompassed
      by the agency, those responsible for content from the different museums
      became the first editors in the new Web platform. They received training
      in Web publishing and were able, with the support of the project team,
      to update and publish the text for which they were responsible on the agency&rsquo;s
      Web site.</p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2: The Home Page of the National Historical Museums (SHMM) <a href="../http://www.shmm.se/">http://www.shmm.se</a> (<a href="berthling_2-SHMM.pdf">PDF</a>) </p>
    <h1>Design</h1>
    <h2>Competition and Design</h2>
    <p>The museum&rsquo;s new Web site needed a design which worked well with
      the information structure produced. A design competition was announced
      with three invited participants, each with a different profile. One was
      a consultant who had completed several commissions for Swedish museums,
      one was an international agency whose clients included several museums
      in the UK, and the third was a large agency which had carried out a wide
      range of marketing assignments in Sweden. The competition criteria laid
      down by the museum concerned usability, durability, design profile, layout
      and typography. The design was to be based on the key words &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo;, &ldquo;airy&rdquo;, &ldquo;attractive&rdquo;,
      and &ldquo;news value&rdquo;. In coming up with the Web site&rsquo;s design
      it was particularly important to create a streamlined form which would
      highlight the museum&rsquo;s strong photographic material and which was
      capable of standing the test of time. Great emphasis was also placed on
      typographical design, as much of the content of the Web site takes the
      form of articles. The competition entries were to include the main page
      and another page. The jury comprised the members of the Web project and
      selected key staff at the museum. After examining the entries individually
      and jointly, they invited the entrants to present their design outlines
      to the jury. The jury chose the proposal which demonstrated the greatest
      understanding and sense of the perspective of the users. The winner was
      the Swedish agency with great marketing expertise. The final design for
      the Web site was then produced in two months in an iterative process between
      the design agency and the Web project.</p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 3: The Home Page of The Museum of National Antiquities, <a href="../http://www.historiska.se/">http://www.historiska.se</a> (<a href="berthling_3-HistoriskaSE.pdf">PDF</a>) </p>
    <h2>Visualise More</h2>
    <p>The user tests showed that visitors to the Web site greatly appreciate
      visual elements on the site: pictures, ideally detailed close-ups, slideshows
      and video films. The museum owns a great treasury of photographs, and there
      are no problems with copyright as they were taken by the museum&rsquo;s
      photographers: the collections belong to the museum. The new Web site uses
      photographs all the time &ndash; both high quality photographs and simpler
      documentary images. </p>
    <p>The museum also produces video films. Film is a way using the museum&rsquo;s
      expertise in archaeology and history and attracting a large audience of
      different ages. For this reason a link called &ldquo;film and audio&rdquo; was
      created in the Web site&rsquo;s main menu to make the films more visible
      and easily accessible from all the pages. These films are hosted by an
      external streaming provider and are linked to the Web site&rsquo;s media
      player. They are superior in terms of both their content and their technically
      quality; many of them can be shown on a cinema screen with no reduction
      in image quality.</p>
    <h1>Content</h1>
    <h2>Information Structure</h2>
    <p>When working on the structure of the new Web, site we sought to place
      the user/visitor in the centre. The way the content is grouped based on
      the needs and perspective of the user. The structure of the old Web site
      reflected the museum&rsquo;s organisation and was inward looking, despite
      the fact that much of the information was intended for the public.</p>
    <p>The newly recruited staff on the Web project helped to sort the information.
      Gaining a new fresh eye was crucial to creating a logical and durable structure
      for the new Web site.</p>
    <p>Analysing the content of the old Web site made it clear that the structure
      lacked important information. This was because the old Web site had been
      built up by several &lsquo;project islands&rsquo; with separate financing
      and with no clear ownership. Web content had been produced at the museum
      over many years in different projects and pilot studies with no single
      administrator to link them with other material on the Web site. The Web
      site had in-depth content but very little basic material as an introduction.
      Taking an overall approach and producing new introductory material therefore
      became a major part of work on the structure of the new Web site. </p>
    <p>The content of the Web site was grouped under seven main links: Home,
      Visit Us, Exhibitions, History, Film and
        Audio, Press, and Contact. </p>
    <h2>Creating History</h2>
    <p>Talking about an archaeological find or a historical period is how history
      is created. One of the main wishes of the museum was for the new Web site
      to approach historical narrative in line with the way this is done in the
      museum&rsquo;s exhibitions, programmes and publications, so forming an
      unbroken circle. The Web project set aside time to clarify what this narrative
      should be like to help the Web site&rsquo;s editors avoid pitfalls. Guidelines
      were documented in the Web manual. </p>
    <h2>Language</h2>
    <p>The agency&rsquo;s language consultant has examined all the pages of the
      Web site to check that the language is correct and to set a standard for
      future editorial work on the Web site. The Web site is largely text-based,
      although it also contains many pictures and films. It uses simple, easily
      understood language and is adapted to its intended target groups. Great
      emphasis has been placed on questions concerning approach. Who are we talking
      to? What tone should we use? To sum up, the work of language consultants
      on the Web site is about moving from unnecessarily complicated language
      towards simple, modern and correct language use. In order to ensure that
      the quality of the language used remains consistent across the entire site,
      language guidelines were also drawn up in the Web manual. </p>
    <p>Special guidelines were produced for the language used in the series of
      articles <em>Object of the month</em>, where the museum&rsquo;s experts
      have an opportunity to talk about one particular object in the collection
      on the Web site. Here more linguistic freedom is allowed as the articles
      have a named author. The voice of the expert is heard more clearly in the
      articles, creating a positive dynamic with the otherwise standardised language
      on the Web site. </p>
    <h1>System Integration</h1>
    <p>At an early stage of the project on the museum&rsquo;s new Web site it
      was made clear that the Web site was to be integrated with the museum&rsquo;s
      collections database to avoid double storage of images and information
      about objects in the collections. The museum&rsquo;s collections database
      is constantly being updated with new objects and pictures, and keeping
      it up to date is a huge task. It currently contains approximately 5% of
      the around 20 million objects in the collections. </p>
    <p>Work to integrate the museum&rsquo;s collections database with the Web
      site began with a preliminary study of the way the Web site manages images.
      One requirement was that image management on the new Web site should be
      simple and easy for the Web editors, as the Web site is based on rich,
      high quality picture content. The implemented solution means that all pictures
      of objects published on the Web site are requested via an image ID from
      the museum&rsquo;s collections database. Decorative images and marketing
      images on the Web site are stored in the platform&rsquo;s own systems and
      have no link to the collections database. </p>
    <p>System integration between the Web site and the collections database helps
      to make the Web site an integral part of the museum and has raised the
      status of the new Web site in the organisation. System integration has
      also helped to create a coherent approach to pictures and the way they
      are managed in the museum. Integrating the systems made demands of both
      the systems involved, a&nbsp; positive step, improving both the Web platform
      and the collections database.</p>

      Museum of National Antiquities </p>
    <h1>Migration</h1>
    <p>The migration work, reworking and transferring information from the old
      Web site to the new platform, took twelve weeks. Five people with specialist
      professional expertise in Web publishing worked full time on the migration,
      while several others were involved part time. The language of all the content
      was reworked in line with newly drawn up guidelines, and the content was
      fact checked and updated. A total of approximately 7,000 pages were created
      in the new Web platform, a quarter of the content entirely new material.</p>
    <p>Before the migration, a course package was tailored to meet the training
      needs of the museum&rsquo;s editors and the project&rsquo;s newly recruited
      staff. They received four days of training in the Web platform. This included
      elements such as the editing interface, image management and file management.
      The same staff then attended a two-day workshop in writing for the Web.
      The workshop formed the basis of the guidelines which was then written
      for the Web site. </p>
    <p>The migration team spent twelve weeks working together in the same room.
      This proved to be one of the factors behind their success. The team members
      were able to help and support each other quickly and easily. Common problems
      could be discussed and resolved quickly as everyone was there on the spot.
      The five new editors from the museum&rsquo;s different departments also
      took part in the migration work. They each worked one day a week, together
      with the migration team, on migrating the content. This helped to prepare
      the editors for their task ahead. They became very familiar with the Web
      platform, the editing interface, image management and the guidelines produced
      for the new Web site. </p>

    <h1>Project Deliveries</h1>
    <h2>Web Manual</h2>
    <p>During work on the content of the new Web site it became clear that there
      was a need for documented guidelines on use of language and the way history
      is told. Documented guidelines would help the new editors to keep the appearance
      and content of the Web pages consistent despite their being the work of
      many people. </p>
    <p>A Web manual was produced with the help of specialist expertise at the
      museum. The museum&rsquo;s language consultants drew up the language guidelines,
      the museum&rsquo;s archaeologists wrote the policy section on writing history
      and the gender perspective, and the museum&rsquo;s Web editor worked on
      the guidelines on image management and typography. The
      Web manual also contains the goal and purpose of the Web site and a description
      of the work model. </p>
    <h2>New Work Model</h2>
    <p>The model for working on the Web site was begun at an early stage but
      finally took shape in the middle of the Web project. It is based on the
      premise that the whole museum is involved in making the information on
      the Web site as up-to-date as possible. Far from having a single Web editor
      responsible for the entire Web site, in the new model the museum has five
      extra editors recruited from different departments in the museum (curators,
      an exhibition producer, assistant and caretaker).</p>
    <p>The departmental editors together with the Web manager form an editorial
      council which meets regularly. It was considered to be very important that
      the editorial council contain a wide range of expertise and have the firm
      support of the entire organisation. This creates a fast production line
      for new Web content on,for example, exhibitions, new research results and
      programmes. The new Web site also has a management team consisting of the
      museum&rsquo;s director general and its four heads of departments. The
      management team meets a couple of times a year or when the need arises.
      The director of the museum is the responsible publisher.</p>
    <h2>Launch</h2>
    <p>The Web site went public on 26 January 2007. After the launch the Web
      project organised an internal seminar for all the museum&rsquo;s staff,
      declaring the Web site open, so to speak. The seminar evaluated how well
      the interdepartmental project had worked and the impact it had had on the
      work of the line organisation. The purpose of the seminar was to learn
      for the future and ensure that all staff were familiar with the content
      of the Web site and the new work model. </p>

      expertise at the museum. Here we all are. Photo: Andreas Hamrin/The Museum
      of National Antiquities </p>
    <h2>Handover to Administrative Organisation</h2>
    <p>Keeping a Web site up to date takes more work than creating it. This means
      that a well-defined work model is required so that maintenance, checking
      and producing new content can take place creatively without major organisational
      problems. The Web project produced a new work model, as described above,
      and introduced it within the organisation. </p>
    <p>The departmental editors were involved at an early stage of the Web project.
      Due to their ordinary workload, their input in the project was limited,
      but it was sufficient for them to feel commitment and understand the new
      work model.</p>
    <p>The Web project can state that the new work model has had positive effects
      in the organisation, including greater respect for each other&rsquo;s differing
      expertise and professions. It is very important to the administrative organisation
      that it be able to rely on documented guidelines. Formalised procedures
      mean that content, for example, can be produced by an expert and adapted
      for the Web in a consistent and effective manner. </p>
    <p>The actual management of the Web site is working very well, and each department
      is represented by one or more editors who actively check and update the
      Web site&rsquo;s content. The main task of the responsible Web editor is
      to check the quality of the content, support the departmental editors in
      their work, and ensure the development of the Web site.</p>
    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>The goal of the Web project was to create a new Web site, integrate it
      throughout the organization, and develop a new work model for work on the
      Web. Instead of&nbsp; having a single Web editor responsible for the entire
      Web site, in the new work model the museum has delegated responsibility
      for publication, sharing this responsibility among&nbsp; different departmental
      editors in the museum. One important starting point was the belief that
      delegating publication would improve the quality of the information and
      highlight the museum&rsquo;s multifaceted retelling of history. To conclude,
      here we list the positive and negative lessons learned from the project,
      and offer few words about the future. </p>
    <h2>Plusses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Working in cooperation with other government agencies
        made the project more efficient.</li>
      <li>The Web site has become relevant to the entire
        museum, and more staff have become involved in working with it.. </li>
      <li>Thanks to the interdepartmental approach, the
        Web project has helped to create team spirit at the museum. </li>
      <li>The heads of department recognized the advantages
        of interdepartmental cooperation&nbsp; at an early stage and released
        and allocated resources for the project. </li>
      <li>Formalised procedures for content production provided
        even quality and a certain amount of scope for deliberate variation on
        the Web site.</li>
      <li>Improving Web publishing and writing skills was
        found to be stimulating and beneficial by those staff who took on completely
        new tasks as editors for the Web site. </li>
      <li>The Web site has gained higher status internally
        and comes earlier in the production line than previously.</li>
      <li>Cooperation with IT consultants was initiated
        at an early stage and has been excellent, from the workshops phase to
        programming and launch.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Minuses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A great deal could have been done on the Web project
        even before the platform was chosen. </li>
      <li>With hindsight it can be said that the museum
        had too high expectations of what IT solutions could achieve. </li>
      <li>The project should have been formalised in the
        museum long before the choice of technical platform.</li>
      <li>A very tight budget meant tough priorities had
        to be set.</li>
      <li>It would have been desirable to have a single
        approach for all the agency&rsquo;s Web sites right from the start.</li>
      <li>The Web project should have had a dedicated picture
        editor taking responsibility for the selection, new production and overall
        quality of all the museum&rsquo;s images &ndash; everything from high
        quality photographs to documentary images.</li>
      <li>The agency&rsquo;s language consultant was brought
        on board at the final stage of the project; this should have happened
        sooner.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>The Future</h1>
    <p>In the very near future, in phase 2 of the Web project, system integration
      will come even further and the Web site will have expanded service functions
      such as newsletters, an Internet shop, image library, and more learning
      resources. </p>
    <p>In the future the museum will also investigate new arenas to market the
      Web site, e.g. in wikis, in discussion forums, and blogs, so reaching new
      target groups. Analyses of the traffic on the new Web site and evaluation
      and revision of the work model are also on the wish list but should only
      be carried out once the traffic demonstrates a certain amount of stability
      and the new working procedures have become established.</p>
