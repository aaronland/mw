      <h2 class="Author">Junko Iwabuchi, Research Institute for Digital Media and
      Content (DMC), Keio University, Tokyo, Japan</h2>
      <p class="URL"><a href="../http://www.volumeone.jp/" target="_blank">http://www.volumeone.jp</a></p>
      <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract </h3>
      <p class="abstractText">VOLUMEONE was introduced by a team led by Prof.
        Junko IWABUCHI of the Research Institute for Digital Media and Content,
      Keio University, Tokyo, Japan, in May, 2006, as a prototype multi-channel
      video presentation platform on the Web. It is designed to host museums
      of various disciplines to distribute their in-house-produced educational
      video programs for audiences of K to 12 Schools, Universities, adults,
      and children in hospitals with long-term illness who require educational
      and intellectual entertainment programs without going outside.  </p>
      <p class="abstractText">Prof. Iwabuchi's firm belief  is that more diversified
      use of museum content will be a great service to those mentioned above,
      and with that in mind, her team created a video content distribution platform
      that is easy to manage for the administrator and graphically attractive
      for the audience. </p>
    <p class="abstractText">Since its introduction in May 2006, there have been
      some alterations done to the original platform. New features have been
      added since October, 2006: Pod-casting, rating by the audience, sorting
      by categories, and search tags. The visual appearance is also slightly
      different now as the current platform is not in multi channels, but in
      a single channel with categories and sort-by search tags.  A new section
      distributes &ldquo;news&rdquo; independently of video files.   </p>
    <p class="keywords">Keywords:  Web-based video-casting, pod-casting,
      MP4, FLV, Weblog  friendly, intermediary, collaboration</p>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>In the beginning, VOLUMEONE was created as a response
      to under-funded smaller museums that wished to have video-casting programs
      on their own Web sites.  Now VOLUMEONE offers much more: it features
      added functions such as pod-casting, rating by audience, sorting by categories,
      and search tags.  The platform can also distribute &lsquo;news&rsquo;independently
      of video content, and it still maintains features from the original version,
      such as &quot;share this video with friends by E-mail,&quot; &quot;create
      a link to this video,&quot; &quot;paste this video to your Web site or
      to your Weblog&quot;, all by just one click.   </p>

      you enter the Web site, select &ldquo;English&rdquo; before clicking on

      version of Adobe/Macromedia Flash Player (currently, Ver.9, or newer) to
      watch video clips on  VOLUMEONE.</p>
    <p>The long and interesting story for museum professionals about why the
      author, Prof. Iwabuchi, became interested in such a project was already
      mentioned in detail in her paper presented at the CIDOC meeting in Gothenburg,
      2006 (Iwabuch 2006).  To make a long story short, everybody supported
      her idea because such a commitment seemed quite appropriate for a research
      institute at a University, an ideal intermediary between museums and their
      audiences at large.  So the team went ahead and created a prototype,
      using a small part of the existing server at the institute.  The time
      spent for implementation was about 2 months: this was achieved without
      making any new purchases except the fee paid for obtaining a new domain
      on the Web.  </p>

    <p>&quot;Taking a Museum Experience to Your Real World - Exploring a New
      Usage of Museum audio/visual Guide in Children's Hospital, Retirement Homes
      and More&quot; was presented at CIDOC 2006 and is available at <a href="../http://cidoc2006-iwabuchi.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://cidoc2006-iwabuchi.blogspot.com</a></p>
    <p>The original version of VOLUMEONE in multi-channel, introduced in May,
      2006, has changed its name to VOLUMEZERO and is still on view at the following
      Web site: <a href="../http://www.volumezero.jp/" target="_blank">http://www.volumezero.jp</a></p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a><a href="iwabuchi-fig3.html"><img src="iwabuchi_Fig.3a.jpg" alt="Fig 3: Current view of VOLUMEZERO as of January 29, 2007" width="400" height="287" border="0" /></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 3: Current view of VOLUMEZERO as of January 29, 2007</p>
    <p>The video clips here on these sites are provided to
      DMC Institute under direct agreement with the original author of each clip,
      and the general terms and conditions for users can be viewed on the Web
      site. </p>
    <h1>What Exactly is VOLUMEONE? </h1>
    <p>In order to explain exactly what VOLUMEONE does, let us start by describing
      what  VOLUMEZERO, the original version in multi-channel, does.  Using
      VOLUMEZERO, museum program administrators (shown as Panelist here in Figure
      4) with assigned ID and a Password issued by theDMC Institute (the administrator
      of the whole platform itself) can upload their movie files on the Web wherever
      they are and make these files video-castable by flash video Web streaming
      almost instantly.  </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig4" id="Fig4"></a><a href="iwabuchi-fig4.html"><img src="iwabuchi_Fig.4a.jpg" alt="Fig 4: Technical illustration of VOLUMEZERO " width="400" height="360" border="0" /></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 4:  Technical illustration of VOLUMEZERO   </p>
    <p>A unique feature of VOLUMEZERO since the time of its release is that each
      video file is assigned a permanent link so that just one click produces
      a link to that particular video.  It is also equipped with a button
      to produce a script to transport video clips to Web pages and Web logs
      run independently.  With a little help by VOLUMEZERO, museums could
      fill their Web sites with video content by using the paste-up video function.</p>
    <p>Now let's take a look at VOLUNEONE, the current version.  The team
      at DMC institute started the testing of the new VOLUMEONE in late August.
      (They were preparing for a  sneak preview at the time of the CIDOC
      conference in Mid-September, but the official date of release was not until
      October 23, 2007).      </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a><a href="iwabuchi-fig5.html"><img src="iwabuchi_Fig.5a.jpg" alt="Fig 5: Technical illustration of VOLUMEZERO " width="400" height="300" border="0" /></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 5:  Technical illustration of VOLUMEONE</p>
    <p>The most dramatic change with this version is the start of video pod-casting
      via i-Tunes and the addition of a section to distribute news independent
      of descriptions of video content.  Now users can search for content
      regarding their interests by using categories such as &quot;museums,&quot; &quot;history,&quot; &quot;short
      movies,&quot; etc. and by key words or search tags.  </p>
    <p>The DMC Institute at Keio University launched a year-round collaboration
      with Kawasaki City Museum  in August, 2006 (Kawasaki), and after the
      official release of the new VOLUMEONE, the team helped Tokyo FILMeX , the
      international film festival of independent film makers with focus on Asia
      (Tokyo), with both Web- and pod-casting their promotional trailers and
      doing interviews with directors and actors on the spot everyday. </p>
    <h1>Where Does VOLUMEONE Go From Here?</h1>
    <p>As an educational institute, we don't mean to interfere with the interests
      of producers of museum audio tours.  Our purpose is to explore the
      possibilities to enhance the multi-media capabilities of museums' educational
      programs so that those who love museums yet cannot come to the museums
      due to restricted mobility have a better chance of enjoying museum content
      off-site. </p>
    <p>Since VOLUMEONE can so easily and quickly upload any video files, museum
      staff could make a new presentation and upload it almost every day, or
      take full advantage of existing video archives within their institutions
      and show them all on the Web.  They can choose, or not choose, to
      pod-cast these programs to be downloaded to MP4 players.</p>
    <p>With its easy-to-upload capability, a museum staff member with a DV Cam
      could ask a group of ten-year-olds to tour with him and then capture comments
      by these kids as they walk through galleries. The video clips could be
      made available on the Web for public viewing a few hours afterwards.  Such
      lively comments that only real 10-years-olds could give, with moving images
      of their faces and with exhibition and other activities going on in the
      background, would be a gift to kids of the same age in hospital.  At
      the same time, an elderly group might enjoy watching the kids having a
      good time in the museum; it would remind them of the museum atmosphere
      and provide a physical sense of being  there with young people.  We
      hope VOLUMEONE will continue to provide alternative ways to enhance museums&rsquo; normally
      more structured official educational programs.</p>
    <h1>Conclusions as of January 30, 2007</h1>
    <p>VOLUMEONE is, basically, a flash-based video content distribution platform
      very much like <em>YouTube,</em> if you
      are familiar with their service.  But it is not open to a mass audience
      to upload their own materials.  It provides a more controlled and
      clean-looking environment without any advertisements and is operated like
      a club of not-for-profit organizations approved by the DMC Institute/Keio
      University as research partners for collaboration.  However, the future
      of VOLUMEONE still lies in ambiguity. Whether it goes open source entirely,
      or goes into a service by the DMC Institute/Keio University itself, or
      launches a new business in partnership with a private company that specializes
      in consultancy to the not-for-profit sector, will be an institutional decision
      taken within a few months.  In case the Institute chooses the 3rd
      alternative as the destiny of VOLUMEONE, open source software FFMPEG, used
      for encoding flash video, will be replaced by original technology developed
      internally.  </p>
    <p>For the time being, DMC Institute/Keio University welcomes any interest
      from museums for collaboration.  Please feel free to make contact
      any time during the conference, or by E-mail.      </p>
