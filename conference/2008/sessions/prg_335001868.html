			<h2>Reflections on Museums and the Web 2008</h2>
<p><a href="../bios/au_1337.html">Clifford Lynch</a>, Coalition for Networked Information, USA</p> 
<p>For many years Clifford Lynch has been at the center of networked information initiatives in the academic and library communities. As Executive Director of the Coalition for Networked Information he has developed a unique, synthetic perspective that brings together a broad range of concerns about networks and connectivity: technological, institutional, content and personal.
</p><p>Clifford will offer a summation of key issues he&#39;s heard discussed -- and overlooked -- at Museums and the Web 2008, and set the stage for closing reflections from delegates.</p>
