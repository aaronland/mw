<p>As discussed in the 2007 Museums and the Web paper and presentation, &#34;Building an On-line Community at the Brooklyn Museum: A Timeline,&#34; (<a target="blank" href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw2007/papers/caruth/caruth.html">http://www.archimuse.com/mw2007/papers/ caruth/caruth.html</a>) in 2006, the Brooklyn Museum set out to further engage its existing on-line audiences and continue to build an interactive Web community. We described how we utilized offsite Web 2.0 sites and services to engage our younger audience demographic, to extend the physical visit, and to provide interactive tools for contemporary learning. We discussed how in spring 2007, after notable success with these projects, we made the decision to bring community back home, integrating sites such as Flickr and YouTube into the Museum&#39;s own Web site. Our 2008 paper picks up where we left off last year by detailing some of the projects, developments, and realizations we’ve made over the past year - including blogging, electronic comment books, a Facebook application, a YouTube-based video competition, and an experiment with Twitter - in our ongoing effort to link Web and gallery interaction, both physically and virtually. </p>
