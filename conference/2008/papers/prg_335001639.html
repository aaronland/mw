      <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="AbstractText">What is the Museum’s role in giving voice to the objects
        it presents? A recent exhibition of Scandinavian artist Olafur Eliasson
        provided an opportunity to test one institution’s internal tolerance for
        multi-vocal popular response. Eliasson explicitly states that his immersive
        environments are set-ups for engagement, and that the viewer completes the
        work. With that in mind, the SFMOMA Interactive Educational Technologies (IET)
        team produced an interactive kiosk / Web site that offered background
        commentary and footage of the artist discussing his philosophy and studio
        practice, but stopped short of describing individual works in detail. That role
        was left to the visitors, each of whom, it was theorized, would have a personal
        experience of the various works in the show. What would come of this kaleidoscopic
      perspective?</p>
      <p class="AbstractText">There were technical as well as philosophical hurdles to
        overcome – notably, mashing up a static Pachyderm presentation with a
        customized WordPress blog - but the emphasis in this paper will be on
        implications for interpretive practice, and the opportunity opened up by Web
        2.0 technologies to a) get to know our visitors better, and b) come to know the
        artworks we display differently through the prism of visitor interpretations.
        What is lost by allowing the museum’s message to become more “diffuse?” What
        are the limits of this democracy of voices? Are there specific strategies that
        elicit and give shape to more compelling content for readers, and greater
        insights for the visitors who contribute to the conversation? These and other
        issues that have arisen over the course of this first SFMOMA blog experiment -
      running from September 2007 through February 2008 - are discussed.</p>

      <h1>1. Objects, People, Places – and Experiential Spaces</h1>
        <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Objecthood doesn’t have a
          place in the world if there’s not an individual person making use of that
          object… I of course don’t think my work is about my work. I think my work
          is about you. (Olafur Eliasson, 2007)</p>
      <p>Artist Olafur Eliasson is by no means the first person to
        emphasize the importance of one’s own senses as they engage with an artwork or
        outside stimulus. Psychologists, philosophers, neuroscientists, Marcel Duchamp,
        and yes, even museum professionals have spent a great deal of time thinking
        about what happens when visitors encounter an object or environment that
        activates their senses. Stephen Weil’s breakthrough formulation came in the
        late 1990s, when he advocated that museums retool their objectives from “being <i>about</i> something to being <i>for </i>somebod<i>y</i>”
        (Weil 1999). In that light, Eliasson’s approach might be viewed as an extreme
        case of art’s project in general: “The work itself I often refer to as a
        machine, or a phenomenon-maker, but without an individual person it doesn’t
        really do much” (Eliasson, 2007). The same can be said of the <i>Mona
      Lisa</i>.</p>
      <p>A corollary to this emphasis on the individual’s subjective
        response is a rejection of any flattening of museum messages to a single
        authority voice. How can we pretend to stand in for the variety of inflections,
        the prismatic range of perceptions our visitors may have, each with a personal,
        specific background, aptitudes, and entrance narrative? Of course, most
        interpretive discourse is not written with the <i>intention</i> of flattening or reducing an artwork’s meaning
        – on the contrary, the hope is to open the visitor up to a deeper art
        experience. But inevitably, one field – typically art history – is
        privileged, and other perspectives are demoted by their conspicuous omission.
        The net effect can be a disempowering of the visitors’ own real-time gaze and
      embodied sensations. </p>
      <p>All of these issues were put to the test in the exhibition <i>Take
        your time: Olafur Eliasson</i>, presented at
        SFMOMA from September 8, 2007 through February 24, 2008, in conjunction with
        another smaller but no less spectacular Eliasson show titled <i>Your </i><em>tempo</em>. <em>Your</em> <em>tempo</em>, presented in the Museum’s second
        floor Architecture and Design galleries, closed on January 13, 2008. It focused
        on Eliasson’s BMW H<sub>2</sub>R art car commission, an “ice car” dubbed ‘Your mobile
        expectations’ that was enclosed in a walk-in freezer. In fact, both exhibitions consisted not of paintings
        or sculptures per se, but rather a series of immersive, perception-enhancing
        environments (Fig’s 1 – 3). Some used altered light sources
        (mono-frequency sodium vapor lamps in <i>Room for one colour</i>; a computer-controlled timed immersion in the
        spectrum in <i>360º Room for all colours</i>); others employed lenses, mirrors or dichroic glass to deconstruct our
        normal visual field and return it to us in altered forms (<i>Yellow vs.
          purple</i>, <i>Sunset kaleidoscope</i>, <i>One-way colour tunnel</i>, etc.); and in still others, water in a descending
        spray or reflected pool created stunning tactile and visual effects designed to
      be experienced as an individual and in a group (<i>Beauty</i> and <i>Notion motion</i>).</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig. 3: Olafur Eliasson, <i>Notion motion. </i>Eliasson’s spaces are inherently social. In this
        case, the group shares responsibility for triggering the phenomenon. By
        stepping on protruding floorboards in a deck, visitors cause an upward rippling
      of light and shadow patterns projected from a water surface behind the scrim.</p>
      <h1>2. Roles, Risks, and Rewards</h1>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Who has the responsibility for seeing what we see?
        …Is it about sameness? …Or is it about differences? Is it about suggesting that
      every time you take a step you see something different? (Olafur Eliasson, 2007)</p>
      <p>Was there a role, then, for interpreters in the presentation
        of these catalytic objects? What was the risk if we didn’t intervene? What  if we did? In our conversations with the artist in Germany, he made
        clear that he was aware of the risk that his works would be enjoyed merely as
        spectacle, unexamined entertainment akin to a Disney experience. “The thing
        is,” he said, “I don’t think we should be afraid of doing something very
        beautiful, and very engaging, and very somehow seducing, emotionally very
        challenging. I think it’s worthwhile taking up the – kind of the blurred
        area between something seductive and… something more rigorous.” That said, his
        expressed goal was to promote “criticality,” which he defined as “introspective
        sensing – meaning that you are both sensing, but you are also able to… evaluate
        the nature of what – the construction of what you’re sensing.” How then,
        we asked, in an exhibition environment devoid of wall texts or interpretive
        affordances, did he hope to promote self-awareness, this stepping back from an
        unreflective immersion in the stimuli of his show? “By virtue of the
        communicative effort laying in the hands of the museum, essentially, one should
      make sure that the spectacle doesn’t take over,” was his reply. </p>
      <p><b>The challenge we took on then: </b>to express Eliasson’s own emphasis on critical
        self-observation, and to find a way to invite visitors to report their personal
        perceptions in hopes that the act of committing them to writing would stimulate
        introspection and reflection. We further hoped that the sum and diversity of
        these responses would evoke a larger, more collective representation of these
        two exhibitions in a way that no one person – or museum – could
      hope to convey alone. </p>
      <h1>3. If You Build It…</h1>
      <p>With this in mind, the SFMOMA Interactive Educational
        Technologies (IET) team engaged in our own critical reflection about the
        processes we use to develop interpretive resources. Past productions - <i>Making
          Sense of Modern Art</i>, <i>Matthew
            Barney: DRAWING RESTRAINT</i>, <i>Voices
            &amp; Images of California Art: Robert Bechtle</i>,
        etc. (all available at <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/education/edu_online.html">http://www.sfmoma.org/explore/ multimedia/features/</a>) have been characterized by a mix of: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>museum-scripted
          narrative text</li>
        <li>video
          clips of the artists themselves </li>
        <li>video
          or audio clips of art historians or curators</li>
        <li>complementary
          images (either documentary or of related artworks)</li>
        <li>primary
          source documents. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Taken together, these provide context for the works on view.
        While we may hope for these resources to be received in an open-ended and
        suggestive – rather than a prescriptive – way, we have to concede
        that to an outside viewer, when these programs are published by the Museum,
      they come across as a “museum” or “authority” voice. </p>
      <p>How to avoid this pre-emptive strike against visitor
        experience? How to foreground the idea that the exhibition’s meanings are the
        sum total of myriad individual sensibilities moving through these gallery
        environments, each space designed as a “device for the experience of reality”
      in the visitors&#39; own time? How to evoke the multiple facets of this populist prism? </p>
      <p>It seemed important not simply to decamp and abandon our
        role altogether. First of all, it was key to communicate the artist’s emphasis
        on criticality, “sensing ourselves sensing” or “seeing ourselves seeing.”
        Secondly, we were convinced Web 2.0 does not just mean the cult of the amateur.
        It means opening up expert voices to a broader dialogue, one that includes
        non-experts… or people who bring other forms of expertise to bear. So for this,
        our first foray into written (vs. podcast) Web 2.0 experimentation, we decided
        to create an on-site kiosk / on-line Web site that mashed up a Flas presentation about Eliasson&#39;s philosphy and studi practice, authored in Pachyderm with a custom-designed blog or comment-space inviting our visitors to &#34;share their experience&#34; of the specific artworks in the show (Figs. 4a and 4b). [Pachyderm is a
        Web-based authoring and publishing software originally developed by SFMOMA and
        used to publish most of the programs listed at the SFMOMA url - and recast as
        an Open Source platform under an IMLS-funded grant to the New Media Consortium
        (NMC). For more information, see <a href="http://www.pachyforge.org/">www.pachyforge.org</a>.] After all,
        each person <i>is</i> the expert about his or
      her own experience.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 4a: Home page for SFMOMA’s Olafur Eliasson interactive

      blog pages adapted using the WordPress engine (linked to the footer). </p>

      <p>The Pachyderm feature consisted of four Flash screens with
        texts, stills, and videos that offered background on Eliasson’s project, while
        the blog was constructed as a set of twelve static Web pages hosted at
        wordpress.com. Because the Pachyderm feature was to function as the front door
        to the blog, we gave the WordPress pages a drastic
        CSS-makeover to make the union of the two technologies appear seamless (Figures
        5 and 6). The blog &#34;entries&#34; were placed non-hierarchically in a row,
        rather than the chronological cascade found
        in most blogs. In effect, the image of the artwork and its title were the sole
        initial post on each page; visitors on-site or on-line were invited to
        contribute their own reflections about it using the blog’s comments function.
        [Other un-bloglike characteristics were the absence of an RSS feed or external
      links. See Simon 2007.]</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 6: One of twelve artwork-specific visitor comment pages</p>
      <h1>4. …They Will Come. Now What Will They Say?</h1>
      <p>The pages were empty receptacles, but for an image.
        Fortunately, and relatively quickly, the comments began to trickle in, and our
        wager – to solicit feedback by artwork rather than at a more generalized
        exhibition-wide level – seemed to be paying off, as visitors chose to
        comment, and to comment differently, on their experiences of specific works. As
        time went on, the most popular pages – the ones for <em>Your mobile
        expectations</em>, <em>Beauty</em>, and <em>360º Room for all colours</em> – displayed between
        forty and sixty comments streaming in a long column, documenting visitor
        reactions from the exhibition’s opening after Labor Day through the New Year’s
      holiday. </p>
      <p>That said, many in the museum were
        underwhelmed by what they read. In fact, when perused in a continuous stream,
        there was, as the French say, à boire et à manger – a real mixed bag
        ranging from one word exclamations like “Cool!” and “Awesome!” to short
        disquisitions on the multiple levels of perception elicited by contact with a
        work. It was all there, unedited – almost completely unexpurgated. [A
        handful of comments were removed, most completely unrelated to the topic. That
        said, we did apply moderation tools and WordPress’s akismet spam filters to the
        blog just in case. Judging from this experiment, in the future, moderation
      might not be necessary.]</p>
      <p> And it was
      messy. Here, as an example, are the first three comments from Beauty (Fig 7): </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Beauty really lives up to its name. Be sure to walk
        all the way into the space to see the ethereal rainbow-like effect. If you just
        poke your head in the room, all you see is a curtain of water, and you’re
      totally missing the piece. (Nossaile Rufalo) </p>

        grid, or even the footprints as people tramp across. Beautiful, amazing,
      wonderful! Thank you to everyone who made that possible.</p>
      <p>Each of these visitors shows an acute sensitivity to his or
        her own perceptual field in relation to the artworks they describe. We in the
        art world appreciate this kind of precision. What we may value less are
      stereotypical effusions of this order:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">it was the awsomes thing ever in someones life (Nick

      (David re: Ventilator)</p>
      <p>What are we to do with this? With ourselves? Are we just hopelessly
        uptight, or should we do our visitors and readers a service by curbing such
        unbridled expressions of enthusiasm, especially when they bring no added or
        original insight to the table? At this point I have no answer to this question.
      I am merely asking it.</p>
      <p>To illustrate that there are many sides to this issue, let
        me include an alternate viewpoint from a museum colleague: “I thought blogs were about democracy of space and that was the
        reason for using them inside the museum, not to intimidate but to invite
        comments, even simple and effusive ones (which might be from 14 year olds and
      include 25!!!!!).”</p>
      <h1>5. Dialogue Within The Blog </h1>
      <p>Many visitors proved both articulate and opinionated about
        issues where no art specialization was needed. Where Eliasson’s work intersects
        with global warming, in the hydrogen-powered ice car <i>Your mobile
          expectations</i> (Fig. 8), a number of comments
        engaged environmental issues – a matter of increasing urgency in the
      local, national, and international consciousness: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">This space takes you out of your comfort zone and
        creates a heightened awareness of self and your relationship to the object
        which you are consuming. Often you go into museums only to find everything
        looking so similar after several hours of being there. This room is not like
        all the others, and makes you highly aware of being there. The frozen form
        itself feels impermanent to me both in form and its material ice. One gets the
        feeling that it won’t last for long without an artificial environment to
        sustain it. I wish it could live permanently without so much energy to sustain
      it. (Michael Limaco)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">While I was breathtakingly inspired and moved by the Take Your Time exhibition, I was frustrated by
        the car. It seemed such a cheap, obvious statement, not at all creative, and
        using a hell of a lot of power, no matter whether it came from fossil fuels or
        geothermals. If the artist really cared about global warming, he would have
        found a more appropriate way to make the statement. That said, the frozen car
        was beautiful – but don’t con me that it really an expression of
        environmental concern. (Joan Stockbridge, Your
      mobile expectations)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Running a giant freezer is using extra power that is
        increasing global warming !!!!!! (Anonymous, Your
      mobile expectations)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">to the anonymous comment above regarding the power
        needed to run the freezer: if you look at what David Littlejohn says you will
        read: all the energy required to keep a 9600-cubic-foot refrigerator running at
        14º F 24 hours a day for six months comes not from fossil fuels, but from a
        field of environmentally benign geysers and underground geothermal energy
      sources, 72 miles north of San Francisco – a very Icelandic gesture.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">other than that i think the piece is stunning and
        otherworldly. i have visited the museum 3 times so far and still want to go
      another 3…until i saturate myself with his amazing art…(Toni, Your mobile expectations)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">…Also I have to say on first visiting this I thought
        about the energy cost of refrigerating this, so I guess it is through Calpine’s
        geo-thermal plant in N. Calif. (I’d like to know how that works within the
        existing power transmission network, isn’t all the power going through the same
      lines, whether geo-thermal or coal/oil powered?). Zorga Lina, Your mobile expectations)</p>
      <p>In fact, the “ice car” elicited more comments than any other
        single artwork. To experience it, visitors had to undergo an elaborate entrance
        ritual - donning gray blankets, receiving a prep talk from a museum staffer,
        then entering into a giant, room-sized freezer kept between 4 – 6º F. The
        effect on skin and psyche was searing and indelible. (More on that when we
      discuss “Visual Velcro.”) </p>

      <h1>6. Evidence For Visitor Profiles</h1>
      <p>In the effort to better understand our visitors, a growing
        literature has developed in recent years on segmentation of museum audiences,
        visitor profiles and entrance narratives. Blogs may provide ample evidence for
        future researchers along these lines. They are in effect the free-text fields
        that many visitor surveys leave out – although the respondents are
        admittedly a self-selecting pool. Using the four-fold classification enumerated
        by Linett (2004), one can find evidence for each attitudinal orientation. Here,
        in capsule, are vivid examples of the four different visitor types Linett
      proposed: Culturati, Hungry Minds, Social Seekers, and Family-Focused.</p>
      <p>1) <i>Culturati</i>: Highly
        educated, astute in their assessment of Eliasson’s process, secure in their
        judgment, Culturati occasionally question some of his decisions. Here’s one
      example: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Like so much of Olafur’s work, Your Mobile Expectations is an arresting
        experience. It’s helped by the suspense-building instructions and preparations
        before entering the walk-in freezer. The experience of the chilled environment
      only heightens the observer’s engagement with the object.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">There is something immediately challenging about a
        car concealed beneath ice. For this observer it is a mixture of wonderment and
        absurdity: the former from the beauty of the ice sculpting and its curved
        lines, the latter from the fragility of an exterior that surrounds a moving
        vehicle. That’s the point one must presume: it’s a statement about the delicate
      relationship between one actions and one’s environment. (Guy Gould-Davies, Your mobile expectations)</p>
      <p>2) <i>Hungry Minds</i>:
        Visitors who get a high from visiting a museum but are a bit insecure about their
        own capacity are constantly in quest of more information as their path to
      understanding. Here are two: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I wonder what inspired him? Ah well, I find his
      reflection of the environmental problems we face fantastic. (Will, Your mobile expectations) </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">… far more interesting than the actual room, was
        eavesdropping on moma-goers go on and on about it. the discovery of this
      comment board was particularly exciting, too. (risd, 360º Room for all colours) </p>
      <p>In fact, there were surprisingly few comments of this kind
        in the blog postings. One can speculate that this lack of the typical yen for
        more facts and data speaks worlds for Eliasson’s success in finding a visual
        language that communicates holistically with his visitors. These installations
        impact the body directly through light, color, touch, humidity, play, and
        social interaction. They are haptic/kinaesthetic: when the body is immersed and
        the senses saturated, the mind may no longer feel as desperate to make up that
        deficit of meaning visitors often feel when faced with a ‘mute’ artwork on a
        wall. It is no longer necessary to grasp for facts to organize a story; the
        sensations felt in the present are fulfilling enough. Whether they lead to
        critical reflection of the kind Eliasson encourages is another question; but
      some blog entries suggest that they do.</p>
      <p> 3) <i>Social
        Seekers</i>: In Linett’s typology, <i>Social
          Seekers</i> are less concerned with the art
        than with making the scene: the museum as a venue for a date or an outing with
        friends. They, too, participate in the general ease and camaraderie of these
      environmental artworks which are social by their very nature:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">One of the best parts is to watch the changing of
        colors on the faces of the people inside. If you are shy to stare at strangers,
        go in with a friend so you can look at each other for a while as the colors
        change. Very beautiful, and very different from only looking at the wall.
      (Darryl Ferrucci, 360º Room for all colours) </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">…it all brought a smile to your face and then you
        watch them unfold on those around you. That is the best (anne, Your mobile
      expectations)</p>
      <p>4) <i>Family-Focused</i>:
        The <i>Family-Focused</i> visitors had a
        field day. This group chooses to visit the museum as one of many potential entertainment/leisure-time
        options with their families. Their ultimate index of success is whether or not
      there was a positive bonding experience: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">How delightful to experience this with my 15 year old
        son. We had so much fun! We loved the yellow light when we got off the elevator
        and observing our faces and all the other museum goer’s faces transformed. The
        mist, the waves of water, the frozen car….fun, fun, fun!!!!! I must go back
      again…I’m sure I’ll have an entirely new experience! (Michele Kerr, Beauty)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I took my three-year old son he loved all of
        Eliasson’s stuff, but especially the 360 degree room. We sat in the middle of
        it for at least five minutes and just let the changing colors envelop us. This
        is a great exhibit for young children because it is so immersive and encourages
        interaction. Every piece offers a unique sense of discovery. (Oliver A., 360º
      Room for all colours)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">the tunnel was one of those experiences that you
        don’t know how amazing it is untill you grow older and really love the beauty
        of life. my mother, after coming out, had tears in her eyes, while my nephew
        was amazed, and said it was like a giant kelidescope. thank you for this
      bonding family experience (Merry, One-way colour tunnel)</p>
      <p>One could argue that any typology falls short in predictive
        value when faced with rich multi-sensory impressions works such as Eliasson’s
        elicit. You don’t have to be a <i>Culturatus</i> to have authority in this context, and the blog form serves as an open
        invitation to participants of all inclinations. As mentioned before, while
        museum visitors may not be experts about art, they <b>are</b><i> </i>experts about their own sensations, and can be quite
        articulate about them. This is what in another context (Samis 2007) I have
        called <i>Visual Velcro</i>: the
        capacity of an artwork to hook into visitors’ cognitive structures and remain
        in their memory<i>. </i>In Eliasson’s
        case the ‘velcro’ is not just visual, but multi-sensory – and all the
      stronger. Witness this appreciative comment: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">an amazing exhibit full of simply beautiful
        surprises. so many things to see and experience. not only are they things you
        can see, they are things you can feel and smell. you use all of yourself to
      experience his art. i loved it. (Amy, Your mobile expectations)</p>
      <h1><b>7. </b>Do Artworks Have A “Velcro
      Coefficient”?</h1>
      <p>What else can we learn from the blog comments? Quite
        possibly, the density of the cognitive-emotive ‘hooks’ that each artwork in the
        exhibition afforded to its visitors. We have seen that in many of these works,
        people’s own bodies provided the matrix into which sensory impressions,
        emotions and reflections could weave themselves. Might the number of blog
        comments about each work be directly proportional to its ‘Velcro coefficient’
        – the ease with which people connect to it and find it personally
      meaningful? If so, the results break out like this: </p>
      <h2>TIER 1 (over 40 comments as of Jan 8, 2008) </h2>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li><i>Your mobile expectations</i> (59)<i></i></li>
      <li><i>Beauty</i> (43)<i></i></li>
      <li><i>360º Room for all colours</i><i> </i>(41)<i></i></li>
    </ol>
      <p class="AcknowedgementsText">All of the works in the top
        tier are immersive, sensory rich, and social. The first two were also
        tactile/haptic, subjecting visitors to actual climate changes in the gallery
        (biting cold and falling mist, respectively). The last two were constantly
      changing, and evoked repeated expressions of natural wonder. </p>
      <h2>TIER 2 (over 20 comments as of Jan 8, 2008)</h2>
      <ol start="4" type="1">
        <li><i>Ventilator</i> (29): <i></i></li>

      <li><i>One-way colour tunnel</i> (24)<i></i></li>
      <li><i>Notion motion</i><i> </i>(23)<i></i></li>
    </ol>
      <p>Judging by page view statistics, visitors found artworks in
        this group equally attractive to look at, but they wrote a bit less about them.
        Once again, all works were either immersive and perception-altering or –
        as in the case of <i>Ventilator, </i>the swinging fan in the atrium (Fig. 9) – impinged on
        the visitor’s own body envelope and sense of security. The social factor was
        alive and well, as these environments turned viewers into altered subjects of
        perception, and, particularly in the case of <i>Notion motion</i>, accomplices in the making of
      a constantly changing art event.</p>

      <h2>TIER 3 (less than 20 comments as of Jan 8, 2008)</h2>
      <p class="AcknowedgementsText" style="text-autospace:none">These works,
        while each on its own would stand out in a museum collection, proved less
      popular as topics of discussion. </p>
      <ol start="8">
        <li><i> Multiple grotto </i>(14)</li>
        <li><i> Sunset kaleidoscope</i> (10)</li>
        <li><i>          Model Room</i> (11)</li>
        <li><i>Yellow vs. purple</i> (9)</li>
        <li><i>The aerial river series</i> (Photo-grids) (5)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The photo-grids, last on the list, were most like the works
        art museums typically show: framed and glazed, arrayed in a regulated pattern
        on a white wall. Two out of five comments compared them unfavorably to
        Eliasson’s other works. Is this our audience begging for a new kind of art? Or
        better interpretive affordances for the historically static, non-immersive
        artworks we <i>do</i> show – resources
        that make them feel as relevant to their lives today as Eliasson’s
      participatory, kin-aesthetic experiences do? </p>
      <h1>8. Some Stats: New Interpretation, New Art</h1>
      <p>While there may have been doubts about the unevenness of the
        posts we were allowing on the blog – at times simplistic, at other times
        sophisticated – it appears by the usage statistics that this experiment
        filled a real need. The blog portion of this hybrid site drew 208,000 page
        views in five months – an average of almost 1,400 page views a day.
        Furthermore, when visitors found the blog, either on-site or on-line, they
        stuck with it: average visitors viewed between 8 – 10 of the twelve possible
        pages. In fact, the 400 comments left represent less than 2% of total blog
        visitors. Museum and Web visitors alike were clearly curious to see how <i>others</i> had responded to (or refracted) the prismatic
        ‘devices for experience’ that were on offer. (The exhibition itself drew
        271,266 visitors in the same period of time. A study conducted in the Museum’s
        second-floor Koret Visitor Education Center – the sole on-site location
        where visitors could post comments to the blog – showed a very low
        threshold of awareness about the Eliasson Web feature and blog, a problem
      shared with the other exhibition-related educational resources.)</p>
      <p>This study has only scratched the surface of the visitor
        observations the blog contained. Many of them seem to corresponded quite precisely to
        Eliasson’s ideal of “seeing yourself seeing.” Some started with bodily
      sensation, then segued into poetry, memory, and emotion: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">All of a sudden, the light consumes your peripheral
        vision, and you feel like you are enveloped in hues of yellow, orange, blue,
        pink, green, purple and white. What struck me was how my body physically
        reacted to the changes in color. Pink and orange gave me butterflies, like I was
        seeing a boy I had a crush on. Whereas blue made me feel serene and reminded me
        of when I was scuba diving and would float weightlessly into the abyss. I let
        the emotions roll through me as the light entered and passed through my
        physical being like a drug. (kt, 360º Room for
      all colours)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">With different lights come different dimensions. An
        infinity of stages in the continuum of the electro-magnetic spectrum. As we are
        all self centered individual and separate from each other, man is in essence,
        estranged at birth from other men (or women of course). It seems that our
        perceptions must also be infinite. The obvious, but can a perception lead to
        something else, something more powerful than just one individual? I feel it
        can. I note that the “yellow room” on the top floor, where all color is
        rendered to a black and white (or black and nearly orange) is like stepping
        into a world before color. (Anonymous, Room for
      one colour)</p>
      <p>Additional themes evoked include comparisons and references
        to nature, science and mathematics, mass culture phenomena, and other works of
        art. Some write comments from within the Museum, their sensations still fresh;
        others compose from home with the benefit of hindsight; some turn to the blog
        to evoke their visit for a spouse who couldn’t come along; others declare their
        intention to come experience the works firsthand; and still others write from afar,
      expressing the regret that they won’t see what the others have described. </p>
      <p>Finally, some comments reveal visitors in the process of
      forming a new definition of art:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">For me the fan is by far the most engaging work at
        the Eliasson show. But, then it seems to come from a completely different place
        where the viewer is viscerally confronted and forced to consider his own
      immediate safety. (Kosho, Ventilator)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">It is absolutely amazing how engrossing this simple
        installation is. The other people in the room became totally part of the art
        work to me. Fantastic! Unusual museum fare: Art as experience, rather than as
      object. (Benard Hecker, 360º Room for all colours)</p>
      <p>One can imagine inviting an artist or guest editor to sort
        through the comments to make their own curated selection, giving the blog a
        more precise shape. What else might we do with this rich harvest of visitor
      voices? Might they lead to new interpretive options around the collection? </p>
      <h1>9. Conclusion</h1>
      <p>This summary, drawn from a partial review of a
        blog-in-progress, is suggestive rather than exhaustive and systematic. In fact,
        we really don’t know all the uses to which a blog such as this might be put. As
        the English are wont to say, these are “early days” in museums’ mashing up of
      visitor voices with our own. And much research remains to be done. </p>
      <p>Is there a line museums will not – or should not
        – cross? How far will we go in accepting visitor contributions to our
        officially published content? This seems to be the frontier <i>du jour</i>, and it is playing itself out on multiple museum
        horizons as of this writing. (The Brooklyn Museum launched its blog for <i>Infinite
          Island: Contemporary Caribbean Art</i> (<a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/infinite_island/">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/infinite_island/</a>)
        at the same time SFMOMA launched the Eliasson site; and The Metropolitan Museum
        of Art opened <i>Blog.mode: addressing fashion </i>(<a href="http://blog.metmuseum.org/blogmode/">http://blog.metmuseum.org/blogmode/</a>)
      on December 18, 2007.) </p>
      <p>How willing are we to break the proverbial fourth wall and
        listen in as our visitors describe what they see in our galleries and how they
      connect it to their lives – or fail to do so? Do we really want to know?</p>
      <p>The museum as a commodifying temple on high is now opening
        its doors, and ears, to the visitors, with whom all experience must finally
        succeed or fail, thrive or fall on barren ground. To quote SFMOMA curator
      Madeleine Grynsztejn (2007): </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">We don’t do our best when we simply instruct. We do our
        best when we answer questions alongside the visitor, and ask questions
        alongside the visitor. And when we create a kind of conversation… We don’t do
        our best when we create a one-way dialogue that is assertive and
        one-dimensional. We do our best when we offer multiple avenues of
      interpretation, and when we keep a lot of room for audience response.</p>
      <p>Could it be that in this new participatory age, the museum
        is the sum not of the artworks it contains, but the new experiences and ways of
      thinking it triggers?</p>
