        <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText">Social networking sites have achieved a critical mass of
    popularity in an astonishingly short period of time. Sites such as Facebook
    have become part of mass culture, and now rank among the most popular sites on
    the Web. These sites are radically changing on-line behaviours in the process.
    Museums are frequently represented in these spaces, whether or not they
    actively participate. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">This paper examines social networking sites as a
    distinct, strategic point of presence for museums. It studies specific
    experiments with social media, including a detailed analysis of a Facebook group
    used by the Canada Science and Technology Museum Corporation’s Membership
    Program. It applies two theoretical models – the “Innovation Radar” and
    genre analysis – to help analyze the nature of the opportunities for
    innovation, and to develop a better understanding of the distinctive
    characteristics of alternate communication channels.</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">It looks closely at the new value that can be generated
    from such experiments, such as audience engagement and new avenues for
    research. It explores the challenges of measuring success with emerging media,
    and how organizational objectives and measures can affect the decisions
    institutions make in participating in on-line social networks. It also
    considers how these sites may create both organizational challenges and opportunities
    by enabling greater involvement in innovation and audience engagement by a
    broader base of museum participants. </p>

   <h1>Social Networking and Museums – A Brief Survey</h1>
  <p>Social
    media are a major area of on-line innovation on the part of museums. Museums
    have been active in a wide range of social media, including photo sharing (e.g.
    flickr), video sharing (YouTube), virtual reality (Second Life), blogs, and
    social networking.</p>
  <p>While
    social applications are not new to the Internet (boyd, 2007a), social
    networking has been an area of explosive growth on the Web in recent years.
    Social networking sites “have attracted millions of users, many of whom have
    integrated these sites into their daily practices” (boyd &amp; Ellison, 2007).
    Such sites appear to offer a different community potential than other social
    media – from anecdotal observation, many people who have never
    contributed to the blogosphere have no qualms about posting in a social
    networking site.</p>
  <p>There is
    significant global variation in social networking sites – “participation
    tends to follow cultural and linguistic lines” (boyd, 2007b). For example,
    Google Orkut has gained prominence in Brazil and India, QQ in China, Bebo in
    the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia, and MySpace in the United States
    and elsewhere (boyd &amp; Ellison, 2007). Facebook has taken on a particular
    significance in Canada (explored below).</p>
  <h1>Point Of Presence</h1>
  <p>Social
    networking sites have become a significant potential point of presence for
    museums. This potential has not gone unnoticed in the museum community –
    many museums have been active in this medium. One of the most active is the
    Brooklyn Museum (Caruth &amp;
    Bernstein, 2007). The museum’s on-line “community” section (<a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/</a>) offers a cornucopia of social
    networking and other social media features. Other active innovators include The
    Walker Arts Centre (<a href="http://newmedia.walkerart.org/nmiwiki/">http://newmedia.walkerart.org/nmiwiki/</a>) and the Indianapolis Museum of Art
    (<a href="http://www.imamuseum.org/connect/interact">http://www.imamuseum.org/connect/interact</a>). Many pioneering institutions are
    experimenting with multiple social networking platforms simultaneously.</p>
  <p>There has
    also been significant discussion of social networking among museum
    professionals. “Well used and targeted toward niche audiences, many social
    networking sites will allow museums to meet their goals” (Madsen-Brooks, 2007).
    For the purposes of this paper, we will specifically follow a Facebook
    experiment at the Canada Science and Technology Museum as our primary case
    study.</p>
  <h2>By The Numbers</h2>
  <p>Facebook
    has grown rapidly: having started in 2004, it now has over 63 million “active”
    users (Facebook, 2008). One recent marketing study by ZINC Research and
    Dufferin Research suggests that the site has “become a phenomenon” in Canada,
    with seven million profiles in a population of 32 million. Toronto is the first
    city in North America to have more than a million Facebook users (IANS, 2008).
    The Ottawa network has more than 263,000 profiles, a number representing a
    third of the city’s population (Lin, 2008), or more than a quarter of the
    population of the National Capital Region. Overall, 51% of on-line Canadians
    are members of social network sites, and 80% of them are reportedly on Facebook
    (IANS, 2008). The same study claims that the largest growth in the last half of
    2007 was in the “35-plus generation” (Lin, 2008). A majority of users (67%)
    reportedly spend between one to five hours a week on the site.</p>
  <p>This
    dominance of Facebook as a social networking platform, with its significant
    penetration in older audiences, appears to be a Canadian phenomenon –
    market researchers note that “it is not being picked up by the 35-plus
    generation” to the same degree in the United States (Lin, 2008). The reported
    usage and Canadian penetration, both nationally and regionally, represent a
    potential opportunity for museums in Canada as a whole, and museums with a
    physical presence in hot-spots such as Toronto and Ottawa.</p>
  <h2>Social Media at CSTMC – Membership Program</h2>
  <p>The
    Canada Science and Technology Museum Corporation operates three of Canada’s
    national museums: the Canada Agriculture Museum, the Canada Aviation Museum,
    and the Canada Science and Technology Museum. The Corporation’s Membership Program is one of the most important
    and successful means of identifying an engaged base of clients who contribute
    significantly to its attendance and revenue targets. The Members not only have
    an opportunity to take advantage of numerous benefits offered to them, but more
    and more they also are given a chance to become actively engaged by offering
    ideas, comments and feedback through social media. </p>
  <p>The CSTMC’s
    Membership Program currently services 5,600 active Memberships,  representing
    approximately 21,800 individuals. Offering more benefits and unlimited free
    admission to three of Canada’s national museums, the Program has been a staple
    of success for the Corporation. </p>
  <p>One of the benefits,
    a quarterly Newsletter published by the Membership Program, provides regular
    updates on the Membership Program, as well as key upcoming activities at the
    Corporation’s three museums. A desire for greater interaction with the readers
    prompted the Program to seek out alternative options to engage Members. Fraser
    McDonald, Manager, Membership and Fundraising Programs, explains, “The desire
    to know what our Members are thinking as they read the Newsletter and visit our
    Museums has shifted our attention to more creative and interactive initiatives,
    such as Facebook.” It is clear that the Corporation wants to interact more with
    its Members, but 21,800 active Members seemed overwhelming for the three
    employees of the Membership and Fundraising Programs. Social media seemed to be
    the logical next step in engaging, understanding, and getting to know the
    architecture of their Members and opening opportunities for dialogue with them
    in a way that would be unlikely to happen during a Museum visit.</p>
  <p>The program has
    experimented with three “Web 2.0” media: a flickr group (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/agriculture_technomuses_ca/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/agriculture_technomuses_ca/</a></span>),
    a YouTube channel (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/technomuses">http://www.youtube.com/user/technomuses</a></span>),
    and a Facebook group (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2545680202">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2545680202</a></span>)
    (see Figure 1). For the Membership Program, the reasons for using social media
    are three-fold: to actively engage a segment of individuals to seek their
    opinions, ideas and feedback; to disperse and disseminate information and
    activities about the Museums; and to have the program marketed without large
    sums of dollars being tied up in traditional marketing channels.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="DawsonFig1-thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 1"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 1: CSTMC
    Membership Facebook Group <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2545680202">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2545680202</a></p>
  <h1>Organic Change</h1>
  <p>It is worth noting
    how the Membership Program social media initiatives were started. Of the three
    initiatives, the flickr group has been the most formal, built around the
    already established Membership Photo Contest, and integrated into the Canada
    Agriculture Museum Web site (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.agriculture.technomuses.ca/">http://www.agriculture.technomuses.ca/</a></span>).
    The other initiatives have been approached in a less formal way. </p>
  <p>For example, the
    Membership Facebook group was set up as an “unofficial” experiment, independent
    of the traditional Web and publishing groups within the organization. The
    initiative was not formally managed in the way that most Web activities have
    been. The experiment is reminiscent of a “digital revolution,” as described by
    Incandela et al. (2007). Such grass-roots initiatives may at first appear
    anarchical, but supporting and integrating them can be important in the
    consolidation of broader changes in an organization (Dawson, 2007). The
    creation of the Facebook group is an example of what Huy &amp; Mintzberg (2003)
    describe a rejuvenating “organic change,” one that can complement and
    re-enforce both the dramatic change of new strategic thrusts and the systematic
    change of planned initiatives. </p>
  <p>The Membership
    Program is still in its early stages of utilizing social media to attain its
    marketing and communication goals. There was some concern about internal
    backlash or disapproval, but the Membership Program has been able to
    demonstrate early success with the response of members of the group, with indications
    that this may revolutionize the way information is shared with their Membership
    base. Within days of the first mention of the Facebook Group in the Summer 2007
    edition of the Membership Newsletter, 35 individuals signed up to the Group. As
    of January 2008, that number has more than doubled to 79 individuals with
    little to no advertising. Group members are posting comments for open
    discussions, posting photographs they have taken while visiting the Museums,
    and reading valuable information that may lead them to or enhance an onsite
    visit. Figure 2 shows an example of a member-generated exchange within the
    group.</p>

  <h1> Assessing The Opportunity</h1>
  <p>The
    application of theoretical perspectives can help the cultural heritage sector
    in understanding the properties of digital information and communication
    technologies and the potential changes that are intertwined in their use
    (Peacock, 2007). We will use two models to help us analyze the opportunities
    presented by Facebook. First, we use  Innovation Radar to help us make a broad
    assessment of the opportunities and potential value to both the organization
    and our audiences. We then use Genre Analysis to develop a more refined
    understanding of the potential nature of communications with Members, compared
    with current channels.</p>
  <h2>Innovation Radar: Facebook Members Group</h2>
  <p>The
    Innovation Radar (Sawhney, Wolcott &amp; Arroniz, 2007) is a framework that can
    help museums assess potential opportunities and approaches for innovation
    (Dawson, 2007). Table 1 shows this model applied to identify potential value in
    using Facebook for the CSTMC’s Membership Program across a range of dimensions.</p>

  </tbody></table>
  <p class="caption">Table 1:
    CSTMC Membership Facebook group assessed with the Innovation Radar</p>
  <p>Several
    dimensions (*) have a particular innovative potential:</p>
  <h2>Platform</h2>
  <p>A
    platform offers a set of components that serve as building blogs for products
    or services. Facebook’s wide array of built-in features and add-on applications
    offer many opportunities to use common, modular elements that already exist,
    including groups, the discussion board, the wall, Facebook email, the news
    feed, and the organizational profile. It also offers the potential to develop
    new applications, such as ArtShare
    (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=7723691927">http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=7723691927</a>), created by
    developers at the Brooklyn Museum.</p>
  <p>Of these
    many options, CSTMC’s Membership program has primarily made use of a Facebook
    group, including its Wall and Discussion Board, and Facebook E-mail, to date.</p>
  <h2>Value Capture</h2>
  <p>There are
    several types of non-monetary “value capture,” including a better understanding
    of members; more engaging, two-way communication; and feedback for research,
    such as a tool in front-end evaluation (see discussion below).</p>
  <p>A caution
    is warranted: we suggest it is imperative to respect group members’ privacy.
    For example, harvesting of profile data for off-site use, as played out in the
    recent Facebook-Scoble controversy (Thompson, 2008), is at best a questionable
    practice.</p>
  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>The
    Facebook group represents a significant new process for communications with
    Members. Facebook has allowed direct contribution and management by
    non-“webbies,” who can now make immediate updates. It has also opened alternate
    communications channels, such as Facebook email, the Wall and the Discussion
    Forums.</p>
  <p>Membership
    continues to rely on the re-use of text that has been written for other forms
    of communication, but these updates can now be shared in a more timely way than
    the quarterly newsletter cycle allowed. </p>
  <h2>Presence</h2>
  <p>As noted
    above, social network sites have become a significant part of many people’s
    daily lives. They are virtual spaces in which people are present, in which they
    can engage with museums and each other. </p>
  <h2>Networking</h2>
  <p>Networking
    is at the core of social networking sites. Facebook is an array of overlapping,
    integrated networks, including Facebook Networks (school, work, and city),
    networks of Friends, Groups, Applications, Fans, profile data, etc. Mechanisms
    such as the News Feed, Mini-feed and email allow communications across
    networks.</p>
  <h1>Social Media and The Genre Model</h1>
  <p>The Genre
    Model is another framework that can help museums understand new opportunities
    for digital communications.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote"> A genre is a patterning of communication
    created by a combination of the individual, social and technical forces
    implicit in a recurring communicative situation. A genre structures
    communication by creating shared expectations about the form and content of the
    interaction, thus easing the burden of production and interpretation. (Erikson 2000)</p>
  <p>Genres
    are employed in everyday communication in many forms, including oral (e.g. the
    Conversational Exchange, the Interview), “analogue” media (e.g. the Book, the
    Report, and the Newsletter), and computer-mediated communication (e.g. the
    early Web Home Page, the E-mail Digest and the FAQ) (Crowston &amp; Williams,
    1997). The evolution of genres can also be traced, such as the evolution of the
    business letter of the mid-1800s through the memo to memo in e-mail of the
    1990s (Yates, Orlikowski &amp; Jackson, 2008).</p>
  <p>Genres
    may play out in genre systems or repertoires, in which communication in one
    genre generates expression in another genre. These systems can be highly
    formalized (such as a Request for Proposal generating Proposals) or very
    informal (such as a blog post generating email correspondence).</p>
  <p>Yates and
    Orlikowski introduced genre theory to the information systems community in 1992
    (Erikson 2000). They have evolved their genre model to capture six key
    dimensions to help describe any given genre (Yates, Orlikowski &amp; Jackson,
    2008):</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Why</b> – What is the purpose of the
      communication? What are the associated expectations? Why use this communication
      technology as opposed to one already available?</li>
    <li><b>What</b> – What will be communicated? Are there
      expectations about content with respect to this medium?</li>
    <li><b>Who</b> – Who are the participants involved (or
      who could be involved)? What are their roles (e.g. sender, primary receiver,
      secondary receiver, broker)? Is the communication broadcast, one-to-one,
      one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.?</li>
    <li><b>Where</b> – What is the location of the
      communication? If on-line, then where, and does the physical location of
      participants matter?</li>
    <li><b>When</b> – What are the temporal aspects of the
      communication? How quickly is a response expected? Are there different temporal
      norms?</li>
    <li><b>How</b> – In what form does the communication
      take place? What are the expectations regarding format, language, style, and
      medium?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Genre
    analysis can be particularly useful in examining the shifting media and forms
    of communication on the Web. “Genres are dynamic: they evolve in response to
    the communicative situation” (Erikson, 1999). Situated genre theory considers
    the “ways in which genres arise out of recurring communicative situation,”
    i.e., genre arises “out of the attempts of the genre’s ‘users’ – the
    ‘discourse community’ – to achieve their communicative purpose in that
    situation” (Erikson, 2000). This makes genre analysis a useful tool in
    examining how different communities may develop and employ different genres
    over the same medium – i.e. using a platform in very different ways, with
    different social conventions.</p>
  <p> “In
    order to initiate a conversation, people must not only have an audience, but
    also have a sense of what approach might be effective so that the conversation
    does not flop” (boyd &amp; Heer, 2006). A clear sense of genre helps to both
    establish and satisfy the expectations of the participants, making it easier
    both to initiate and sustain on-line conversations. </p>
  <p>This
    makes genre analysis a useful too for museums to understand emerging and
    evolving digital genres such as social media. As Madsen-Brooks (2007) suggests,
    “institutions need to enter [social networking] spaces with firm answers to
    [fundamental] questions” regarding audience, purpose, information, actions,
    location and other aspects. Genre analysis provides a framework to consider these
    questions. By considering the nature of a given genre, museums can better
    decide whether the genre is an appropriate communications mechanism, and may
    also discover and make use of new genres that help them meet their mandate. </p>
  <p>The blog
    is an example of a genre that has gained significant traction for museums and
    the museum community. There has been much analysis of blogs using Genre
    Analysis (for example, see Miller &amp; Shepherd, 2004; Herring, et al, 2004;
    Herring, et al, 2005; Jackson, Yates &amp; Orlikowski, 2007). Herring et al
    (2005) suggest that blogs now constitute multiple genres, each with its own set
    of expectations. This diversity in genre can also be seen in Museum blogs (as
    illustrated by the range of blog categories at musuemblogs.org).</p>

  <p class="caption">Table 2:
    Genre comparison of Membership newsletter vs. Facebook group</p>
  <p>The genre
    of the Facebook group incorporates the CSTMC Membership Program’s goals of more
    active engagement of their constituency. It also brings to the surface other
    significant differences in this approach to communication, such as the tone and
    informal style of communication.</p>
  <p>It is
    important to note that the description of genre for the Facebook Group is an
    expression of expected or desired outcomes. A genre only truly emerges in the
    repeated manifestation of behaviour. But these expectations are useful, both
    for planning and guiding the use of a medium and when considering questions of
    evaluation and success.</p>
  <h2>Potential Genres Within Facebook</h2>
  <p>Social
    media can be used to play out a wide range of genres. For example, blogs enable
    a variety of digital genres, such as link-centred filters of Web content,
    on-line journals in the tradition of handwritten diaries, travelogues,
    conversational exchanges, or a hybrid of several such existing genres (Herring
    et. al., 2004).</p>
  <p>Facebook
    is composed of features that incorporate even more antecedent genres. Most of
    its varied mechanisms, such as email, bulletin boards, and blog-like features,
    have their roots in other digital or analogue genres. However, there are no
    guarantees that the actual use of a mechanism in Facebook will reflect its
    roots. The different context and diversity of features creates the potential for
    myriad emergent situated genres and genre systems. The dizzying array of
    features and applications makes genre analysis more complex than analysis of
    other digital media, such as blogs.</p>
  <p>For the
    CSTMC’s Membership group, it remains to be seen what genres will emerge over
    time. Will we see reoccurring patterns that stabilize in the form of fairly
    stable, emergent genres? This is clouded by the facts that not only is the
    Membership Facebook Group new, but also many Facebook members are new to the
    site (given the recent, rapid growth), and so their own patterns of use of
    Facebook may not have stabilized.</p>
  <p>However,
    some uses have started to emerge in the use of several Facebook mechanisms.
    These emerging uses can be mapped to traditional antecedent genres, to help
    conceptualize the emerging patters.</p>

  <p class="caption">Table 3:
    multiple potential genres within the Facebook group</p>
  <p>Again,
    these are <i>potential</i> emerging genres – there is not yet enough of a track record to determine
    the degree to which patterns of behaviour will be recurring. There is also
    evidence confirming that conventions are not yet established with the actors;
    for example, bulletin-board style posts have been made both on the Wall and in
    the Discussion Threads. A more established genre would better guide such
    contributions.</p>
  <h2>Facebook and Product Research</h2>
  <p>One of
    the scenarios that played out in the Membership Facebook Group was an
    experimental visitor consultation. This experiment explored the value of using
    Facebook as a research tool in visitor studies.</p>
  <h3>Facebook And Front-End Evaluations</h3>
  <p>Front-end
    evaluations are done in the early stages of an exhibition project in order to
    help teams in the development of their interpretive plans. Usual areas to
    explore include pre-existing knowledge levels, misconceptions, controversy and
    levels of interest for the various themes in development. Front-end evaluations
    can also serve to identify or confirm target audiences.</p>
  <p>Typically, front-end
    evaluations involve both qualitative and quantitative phases. Because each
    exhibition is different, it is almost always necessary to explore the new topic
    with a small number of people before designing a more formal instrument like a
    survey questionnaire. Facebook provides an excellent means of capturing some
    rich impressions as well as seeing what kind of language is used in relation to
    a given exhibition theme.</p>
  <p>The project selected
    for this experiment was an exhibition on bee keeping at the Canada Agriculture
    Museum, scheduled to open in 2010. Although it is still very early in the
    planning phases, one element in need of confirmation was the possibility of
    installing a live hive in the Museum. The display would have a see-through side
    to allow visitors to observe bees in action. A clear pipe leading into the wall
    would also allow the visitors to watch as the bees come and go.</p>
  <p>Both for practical
    and interpretive planning reasons, the decision to install the live hive needed
    to be made very early on in the process, and therefore the research had to be
    concluded in a relatively short time. Fortunately, the main question was quite
    simple: are visitors going to be concerned or upset about the live bees? </p>
  <p>Members joined to
    the Facebook Group were the perfect sub-group to consult in this case. Many of
    them are frequent visitors to the Agriculture Museum and have a strong sense of
    ownership. They are also demographically and psychographically similar to the remainder
    of that Museum’s visitors (the Agriculture Museum attracts primarily families
    with very young children). </p>
  <p>Although the
    exhibition development team had a clear issue in mind, the post was
    purposefully not a question about whether the live bees were scary. It read: </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The
    Agriculture Museum is going to be opening an exhibition about Beekeeping in
    about two years. The team putting it together is thinking of having a live hive
    in the museum (in the room across from the Tractors exhibition). One side of
    the hive would be see-through, and there would be a clear pipe into the wall so
    that you could watch the bees coming and going.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">What
    do you think?</p>
  <p>The reason for this
    was to see what reactions would arise without prompting. Every data gathering
    method carries a certain amount of bias. Formats that do not provide anonymity
    (such as this one) are prone to social desirability bias, meaning people
    respond in accordance to what they feel is socially correct. Avoiding the use
    of key trigger word like <i>allergies</i>, <i>scary</i>,<i> fear</i> or <i>stings</i>, the exhibition team was hoping to see if (and how) Members would
    express those ideas on their own.</p>
  <p><b>Results</b></p>
  <p>To date, 12 comments
    have been posted in response to the blurb. In each case, the response was
    positive and encouraging. Interestingly, two comments did mention bee stings
    and allergies, but not in ways that suggest the Museum should pull this
    display: </p>
  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">
  I
    think that it&#39;s a wonderful idea! I know my three-year-old would love to see
    real bees in action without the fear of getting stung. It would be very
    interesting to see up close. The museum of Nature had something similar years
    ago and as a child I loved to watch the &#34;busy bees&#34;</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I
    think this would be awesome as long as there was no way of the bees getting to
    the patrons. There are so many people with bee allergies. I know my daughter
    would love this!’</p>
  <p>From this step in
    the evaluation, a sense was acquired that the core audience likes the live hive
    idea and believes it will be very engaging for their children. Stings and
    allergies did surface, suggesting that further research would be useful in
    helping the Museum to shape the messaging around the live hive. Finally, it was
    interesting to see how many people mentioned positive memories of past
    experiences with live insect displays in their posts. </p>
  <p><b>Next Steps</b></p>
  <p>As mentioned above,
    the Facebook experiment was not intended to be the sole method of evaluating
    the live hive issue. A Web-based survey is in development that will pose more
    specific questions to a larger sampling of Members. The responses gathered
    through this experiment are proving very useful in creating that survey. The
    spontaneous language the respondents used helps with wording the questions. The
    mentions of memories also suggests an approach for probing respondents about
    what they would like to see, learn and do with the live hive.</p>
  <h2>Comments On Facebook As A Research Venue</h2>
  <p>Every avenue
    researchers use to study humans has drawbacks and limitations. Social
    networking sites are relatively new, and that in itself is a challenge for ensuring
    the quality of our evaluations. Moreover, in environments like Facebook an
    obvious issue is the public forum format. Social desirability bias is more
    likely to be at play when the person leaving the comment is clearly
    identifiable. Along that same line, seeing what others have already said may
    prevent some from giving a differing opinion. The researcher also gives up
    control of who responds, and discussions could sometimes take on a life of
    their own.</p>
  <p>Having acknowledged
    certain issues, the social nature of Facebook does offer great possibilities
    for qualitative research. For respondents, reacting freely to a post is not as
    much of an imposition as a questionnaire or interview. Indeed, we hope our
    Members enjoy and appreciate being consulted. For researchers, the effort, time
    and money required to post discussion threads are minimal. The data collection
    can be modified at any point by the researcher, who only needs to post a new
    comment to affect the discussion. Finally, self-expression and identity are at
    the heart of social networks, and as such they do offer rich details about how
    people view themselves and how they think about different ideas.</p>
  <h1>Measuring Success</h1>
  <p>Measurement
    of Web initiatives is a common challenge. Reporting often relies on basic building
    blocks as indicators. For example, the CSTMC reports several basic, standard
    measures, such as visits, page views and average duration per visit, across all
    of its Web sites, for the purposes of its official Corporate documents. While
    such broad indicators of Web activity are often expected by internal and
    external stakeholders, they are not necessarily the best indicators of
    “success.” </p>
  <p>This may
    present other problems for new media projects. If an organization focuses on
    its official “published” measures, these could logically steer it away from
    experimenting on new, unproven media where the value is not proven and
    measurable by the organization’s traditional, established means. Christensen
    (1997) has written at length about the challenges in nurturing disruptive
    innovations before they are proven.</p>
  <p>Social
    media are of a different nature than other Web offerings. Ideally, we should
    start with an articulation of what success would look like – this should
    help guide both quantitative and qualitative measures. From this starting
    point, quantitative and qualitative measures can be considered.</p>
  <p>To
    generate ideas about potentially useful measures for social networking
    initiatives, we can look to some of its social media cousins. Experiences in the measurement of blogs may be
    the closest analogue. While the genre on social networks may not be as stable
    as with blogs, the broader goals of engagement with these media are similar. 
    We can hope that some of the thinking about how to measure the
    success of blogs may carry over to social networking platforms.</p>
  <p>Fortunately,
    there has been some great thought put into the challenges of measurement of
    blogs. Spadaccini and Chan (2007) have reported in-depth on meaningful options
    for measuring Museum blogs. Along similar lines, Avinash Kaushik (2007) has
    suggested six practical measures for measuring success with blogs (with
    potential for museum applicability, as noted by Seb Chan, 2007). Briefly
    summarized, Kaushik suggests six measures:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Raw Author
      Contribution Rate (posts per month; words per post)</li>
    <li>Audience Growth (visits, unique visitors)</li>
    <li>Conversation Rate (comments per post)</li>
    <li>Citations / Ripple Index (e.g. Technorati rank)</li>
    <li>Cost</li>
    <li>Benefit</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These
    measures imply goals of activity, consistency, engagement, impact,
    manageability of cost, and tangible benefit. The measures are also practical:
    the software mechanisms of the blog and infrastructure of the blogosphere (e.g.
    Technorati) allow for automation in calculating the first four of these six
    suggested measures. </p>
  <p>For
    activity in a social network such as Facebook, the same data access and
    automated mechanisms may not be available. A number of analogues are still
    possible:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Raw Author Contribution Rate: posts
      per month, whether Wall, Discussion Forum or other mechanisms.</li>
    <li>Audience Growth: either number of
      group members, or number of fans.</li>
    <li>Conversion Rate: follow-up comments
      per post, be it Wall post, discussion thread, or initiated email exchanges.
      Count for both museum-initiated and audience-initiated.</li>
    <li>Audience-initiated posts and threads
      (with or without follow-up).</li>
    <li>Cost: based on hours spent
      maintaining the forum.</li>
    <li>Benefit. This is not as easy to
      capture, but may be informed by qualitative aspects.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All of these may
    need to be calculated and tracked manually, not an insignificant issue. For the
    CSTMC Membership Program’s Facebook Group, we have only just begun to
    experiment with such measures, in the hopes of determining which may be
    practical to collect on a sustained basis, and which will provide useful,
    guiding feedback. </p>
  <p>The root of
    the measurement problem ultimately lies in how success is defined. For the
    CSTMC Membership Group, we have captured a set of expectations in both the
    Innovation Radar and Genre models. These models provide us with a qualitative
    framework in which to evaluate the long-term success.</p>
  <p>“Success is
    determined by audience participation” (Caruth &amp; Bernstein, 2007). In social
    networks, another significant avenue to gauge such success is available. Ask
    them.</p>
  <h1>Conclusions</h1>
  <p>The
    social media experiments of the CSTMC have already shown promising results. The
    posts of visitors to the Facebook group have shown animated enthusiasm in group
    members. This in turn has generated enthusiasm among other staff within the
    institution.</p>
  <p>A
    preliminary experiment in using the group for aspects of visitor studies has
    also been promising, as it is quick, convenient, and flexible in modifying the
    discussion thread. It has also been a unique way to access a specific and
    useful sub-group of visitors and help maintain a connection between Members and
    museum staff.</p>
  <p>There
    are, however, a variety of potential pitfalls with social networking sites. One
    concern is whether such sites are a fad or flash in the pan. On the surface,
    sites appear to rise and fall in popularity with surprising speed. A closer
    look shows that decline often happens for specific reasons (for example, see
    [boyd, 2006a] on the decline on Friendster). Still, it may not be wise to
    invest all your efforts in a platform that may be gone tomorrow. The
    multi-pronged approach of innovators such as the Brooklyn Museum and the Walker
    Arts Center seems appropriate. Also, keeping your investment light will make it
    easier to evolve with your constituencies.</p>
  <p>Caution
    is also warranted on other grounds. The Web itself is an open platform, bound
    by open standards. Blogs, while bound by convention of genre, are also
    typically standards-based, and can be under the full control of the owner or
    author. Blogs also appear comparatively stable on a large scale, given the
    distributed nature of the blogosphere. (boyd 2007a).</p>
  <p>The same
    cannot be said for most other social media and social networking sites.
    Contributors are often subject to the terms and conditions of another party.
    For heritage institutions such as museums, closed or restricted platforms can
    pose significant risks with respect to issues such as long-term preservation.
    Cultural heritage institutions should proceed with eyes open, and ensure that
    even if they make use of proprietary media, they can maintain their
    independence and the integrity of their digital information holdings.</p>
  <p>Issues of
    privacy are another important factor. Users of social networking sites appear
    to be willing to live with great compromises in their privacy. However, even
    these broad boundaries have been tested a number of times. Facebook, for
    example, has risked alienating its users in controversies such as the
    introduction of the news feed in 2006 (boyd, 2006a), and the more recent
    introduction of the “Beacon” in 2007 (Hirsh, 2007).</p>
  <p>Privacy
    concerns notwithstanding, these are spaces where museum constituencies can be
    found. Regardless of whether we are present as institutions, our constituents
    will discuss us in these spaces, even creating representations of us in our
    absence. It is interesting to note that two of the first Facebook groups about
    CSTMC – “Canada Agricultue [sic] Museum Alum” (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2234494204">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2234494204</a></span>), and “Petition for a new Science
    and Technology Museum” (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2395639963">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2395639963</a></span>) – were the product of
    enthusiastic supporters or other interested parties, and were not created by
    people currently employed by the museum.</p>
  <p>CSTMC has
    decided to be present, and engage in the conversation as it evolves.</p>
