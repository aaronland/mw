<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In the
    cultural sector we are cautious, careful, meticulous. This is a virtue - it
    ensures that our physical collections are preserved for future generations. But
    when applied to all areas of the business, this same virtue inhibits our
    ability to make the most of emerging opportunities - especially in digital
  space - in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Consumers
    now have a large range of information choices available to them on-line, and
    the longer museums wait to make their rich content widely accessible, the more
    difficult it will be for it to have maximum reach. Access now means far more
    than simply making content available on a corporate Web site. Content now must
    be usable and have some degree of personalisation for the behavioural mores of
    different customer groups. Looking into the future, it will also need to be
  portable and accessible via many different devices and in new ways.</p>
<p>Usability,
    personalisation and portability are difficult, both technically and in terms of
  policy. </p>
<p>Our Web
    sites have been built over long periods of time and on an incremental,
    project-by-project basis. The result is that most of our Web sites
    architecturally resemble a lively shanty town - functioning, vibrant, and
    teeming with life, but with no coherent design aesthetic at the structural
  level.</p>
<p>Traditionally
    the approach to Web shanty-towns has been to impose a top-down &#39;redesign&#39;
    solution - usually a content management system. Whilst a content-management
    system can make significant inroads into &#39;better management&#39; especially in
    museums where Web development skills have been outsourced and Web teams are
    non-existent or made up entirely of producers and editors, it is never a permanent
    solution.  Even after institutions make the move to a centralised
    content-management system, there is inevitably important content left in legacy
    microsites - content that is too difficult to port and too important to take
  offline. </p>
<p>We have
    recently seen, with the disruptive impact of emerging social Web technologies,
    that content-management systems with their traditional &#39;enterprise&#39; focus can
    make agile responses to these new technologies impossible. As a result some
    large organisations with technical development teams, like San Francisco&#39;s
    Exploratorium and Sydney’s Powerhouse Museum, have preferred to deploy
    content-management systems in limited ways across parts of their sites to
  retain flexibility and agility.</p>
<p>Taken
    individually, these different approaches to site design and information
    architecture can work well for their host institutions, but taken collectively,
  they make cross-institutional search and data combining very complex. </p>
<p>Is it
    possible to build cross-institutional initiatives without needing to compromise
    the institutions&#39; own approaches? Is a bottom-up, consumer-focused approach to
  data access possible without top-down standardisation?</p>
<h1>About NSW</h1>
<p>In 2007
    the New South Wales (NSW) State Government commissioned the Powerhouse Museum
    to build and pilot a series of lightweight prototypes to explore the potential
    value of data held in the cultural sector when combined with data from other
    areas of government. Known as <b>About NSW</b>, this project uses an agile development
    methodology to build a number of cross-sector initiatives in a short time.
    Amongst these are a pilot for a calendaring application, an education resource
    cataloguing and exposure application, and a geo-location-aware federated
  collection search.</p>
<p>About NSW
    is working with pre-existing publicly available data from the state&#39;s major
    cultural institutions - Powerhouse Museum, the Historic Houses Trust of NSW,
    the Art Gallery of NSW, the State Library of NSW, the Australian Museum, the
    NSW Heritage Office - as well as other NSW Government departments. The project
    is also exploring connections with complementary data held by third party
    repositories: Libraries Australia, Picture Australia, People Australia,
    Collections Australia Network, the Database of Australian Artists Online, and
  the Dictionary of Sydney.</p>
<p>This
    paper explores some of the About NSW prototypes and suggests that the cultural
    sector can find new value in old content through recombination with other
    datasets, and reach new audiences through better data visualisation. This can be
    a highly productive approach for organisations with large investments in rich
  content in times when funding for the creation of &#39;new&#39; content is scarce.</p>
<h2>How Popular Is Our Existing Content?</h2>
<p>Despite
    impressive self-reported on-line visitation figures, cultural sector Web sites
  represent a tiny fraction of total Internet usage.</p>
<p>In
    Australia the largest cultural sector organisations - museums, galleries and
    libraries - are government funded, and their Internet presences tend, at least
    historically, to be in the .gov namespace. As such, ISP-side measurement
    company Hitwise Australia (<a href="http://www.hitwise.com.au/">http://www.hitwise.com.au</a>) counts their traffic in
  the &#39;government&#39; category.</p>
<p>A look at
    Australian Internet usage for the week ending January 19, 2008 showed that
    government Web sites as a whole represented 4.815% of Australian Web sites
    visited, and 2.319% of all Web sites visited. The most popular government Web
    site in Australia is the Bureau of Meteorology which commands over a 25% share
  of traffic to government Web sites (or 1.2% of all Web sites).</p>
<p>The top
    50 NSW State Government Web sites represent only 0.64% of the total content
    viewed by Australians. Of this small percentage of total traffic, less than 4%
    went to the major cultural institutions. The Powerhouse Museum recorded 0.84%,
    the Australian Museum 1.16%, the Art Gallery of NSW 0.40%, Taronga Zoo 0.55%,
  whilst the Historic Houses Trust did not make the Top 50.</p>
<p>The most
    popular NSW Government Web sites were, unsurprisingly, the combined public
    transport network of buses, trains and ferries (~17%), the Roads and Traffic
    Authority (~10%) which provides motor vehicle registration services, and NSW
  Lotteries (~7%) which publishes lottery results. </p>
<p>These
  figures should not be surprising. </p>
<p>The low
    representation of cultural sector Web sites is due to the nature of the
    Internet as a whole. The majority of Internet activity revolves around
    communication, search, IT companies, entertainment, shopping, news, sport,
  gambling and adult services.</p>
<p>Cultural
    sector Web sites focus on attracting visitors to their physical sites. This
    focus has limited the exposure and impact of much of the other rich and diverse
    content which these organisations generate. This rich content could tap into
    rich veins of traffic around entertainment and social communication. With
    physical visitation limited by geography, tourism patterns and fluctuations in
    exhibition content, there is a cap to the total on-line visitation reachable by
  operating cultural sector Web sites purely with a focus on physical visitation. </p>
<p>Museums
    struggle with strategies for converting &#39;casual Internet visitors&#39; to &#39;physical
    visitors&#39;. Unpublished internal research shows that even as late as 2006,
    newspaper advertising and word-of-mouth overwhelmingly dominate as primary
    communication channels with key audiences. At the same time, the pressure to
    increase &#39;self-generated&#39; revenue in the short-term and reduce dependence on
    government funding does little to encourage the exploration and exposure of
  other content types for which revenue models are still in their infancy.</p>
<p>For those
    who have experimented, the &#39;long tail&#39; of museum content already provides a
    significant traffic driver, especially for the larger pool of international
    audiences in North America and Europe. This is heavily reliant upon
    collection-related content being made available; being presented in a highly
    usable form; and being optimised for search engine exposure. Whilst both the
    Powerhouse Museum (with high on-line interest in fashion, numismatics and
    transportation) and especially the Australian Museum (with high on-line
    interest in spiders, fish and Australian animals) exploit their content long
    tail effectively with international audiences, neither has found a suitable way
    of converting this traffic to revenue in any significant way except through
    encouraging physical visitation - which assumes these international visitors
  are also near-term tourists.</p>
<h2>The Other Side Of Traffic</h2>
<p>The
    institutions already analyse the behaviour and intentions of traffic that gets
    to their Web sites. But they don’t have the resources to look at the traffic
    that might best match their content but <i>never</i> reaches their site. Much like local real world
    audiences who are looking for somewhere to take the family but never think to
    go to a museum, these audiences need to be approached and guided to appropriate
  content. So, where do they go instead? </p>
<p>With the
    low intentional usage of government Web sites for information seeking, the
    About NSW team examined the behaviour of local audiences in selecting Web sites
    with &#39;educational&#39; or &#39;reference&#39; content. Not surprisingly, because of the
    dominance of search engine results, for Australian audiences Wikipedia
    (<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">http://www.wikipedia.org</a>) represents around 25% of this traffic. Partially
    this is in the way that Hitwise measures traffic - conflating the users who
    visit Wikipedia to look up Britney Spears and those who are looking up kangaroo
  (although arguably both are &#39;educational&#39; in different ways). </p>
<p>Given
    that Wikipedia pages rank very highly in Google search results, and that
    Wikipedia is very likely to be the first port of call for general knowledge
    questions, then regardless of your opinion of Wikipedia (and what teachers and
    librarians might discourage), the real questions are, How much of the state&#39;s
    cultural and historical content is represented in Wikipedia? And how popular is
    it? By answering these, it becomes possible to use Wikipedia as a reasonably
    reliable microscope through which to examine the &#39;demand&#39; side of Internet
  content. (Spoerri, 2007)</p>
<p>By taking
    data from a local Wikipedia mirror we were able to datamine the prevalence of
    relevant state-related people, places, historical events and &#39;things&#39; held in
    Wikipedia at the time of the snapshot. Further, we were able to examine their
    relative popularity and extrapolate this to produce a popularity index.
    WikiCharts (<a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~leon/stats/wikicharts/">http://tools.wikimedia.de/~leon/stats/wikicharts/</a>) can be used to
  perform a similar analysis but without the depth of data-mining.</p>
<p>Mapping
    the most popular and relevant topics in Wikipedia to the content held by the
    state institutions makes it possible to generate a list of high-demand content.
    This list is based on an approximation of user demand rather than on the
    traffic that currently reaches each institution. However, acting on this information
  requires editorial choices to be made.</p>
<h2>Obtaining Data</h2>
<p>Once
    choices are made about which content best matches latent demand, the problem
  becomes one of obtaining data.</p>
<p>There are
    two main problems with obtaining data dynamically. The first is that on the
    shanty-town Web sites, data are not uniformly formatted or structured. The
    second is that on Web sites with content-management systems, often data in a
    usable export format such as  XML require &#39;additional development&#39; or the
    purchase of &#39;additional modules&#39;. Even if data were to be exportable, the
  common problems of field mapping would usually still inhibit data sharing.</p>
<p>The About
    NSW solution has been a very practical one - a &#39;best guess&#39;. Acknowledging that
    regardless of policy directives, cultural sector data will inevitably be
    presented in different ways, and the same types of things described in
    different ways, we have been using screen-scraping and complex html-parsing.
    Data are scraped from the relevant sections of partner Web sites using Mechanize,
    and then the messy HTML is parsed with Beautiful Soup. With some custom
    configuration and regular expression scripting, these tools do a &#39;good enough&#39;
    job of harvesting semi-structured information from most Web sites and storing
  it in a structured database.</p>
<h3>An Example - Scraped Calendars</h3>
<p>One of
    our key prototypes is a cross-sector calendaring service which aims to unite
    the various site calendars that exist across different cultural sector
    agencies. Ideally agencies would agree to have similarly formatted RSS feeds
    from their event and exhibition calendars; however the reality is that none of
    the major cultural institutions in NSW have an RSS feed of events and
    exhibitions. Some, including the Powerhouse Museum, do not even store events or
  exhibitions in a database.</p>
<p>Worse
    still, each agency describes events and exhibitions in different ways. Some
    have events with sub-events (for example a festival which has a start and end
    date comprised of sub-events); some have events that recur in non-standard
    ways; others even change the way they present date and time data about their
    events. None use microformats within their events calendar code, and HTML code
  is of varying quality.</p>
<p>However,
    for promotional purposes each agency wants to have its calendar spread
    widely to newspaper portals (for example Citysearch:
    <a href="http://www.citysearch.com.au/">http://www.citysearch.com.au</a>) and other on-line aggregators who target niche
  audiences (for example Kidspot:<a href="http://www.kidspot.com.au/"> http://www.kidspot.com.au</a>, MyTickets: <a href="http://www.mytickets.com.au/">http://www.mytickets.com.au</a>, Upcoming.org: <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/">http://upcoming.yahoo.com</a>).
    Agencies manually contact these portals by emailing publicity contacts, or by
    simply waiting for these third party sites to come and collect the data from
    them. This is sub-optimal from a publicity perspective as well as from a technical
  perspective.</p>
<p>Each
    agency would benefit from being able to have an RSS feed of events as well as
    supporting iCal, yet none has the capacity or motivation to deploy this as a
  high priority. </p>
<p>About NSW
    is able, however, by scraping and parsing their existing content to deliver
    back to the institutions RSS and iCal structured data as well as providing a
    backend administrative toolset for agencies to &#39;clean up&#39; their scraped data if they so
    wish. These RSS and iCal feeds can then be aggregated more easily by commercial
  content portals, as well as used by the institutions for other purposes. </p>
<p>Although
    each institution has categorised its events in different ways for its own
    sites, the data can be harmonised externally on About NSW where it is
    reorganised on stripped down criteria for a general audience. Because each
    harvested event carries an &#39;origin URL&#39;, users can click through to the partner
  Web site for more detail and event specifics.</p>
<p>In the
    future it is possible that About NSW will provide a calendar widget effectively
    offering agencies the ability to use About NSW to store all their
    calendar-based content and then deploy this to their own site, eliminating the
  need for scraping. </p>
<p>This
    &#39;opt-in centralisation&#39; approach offers the benefit of a
    &#39;try-before-you-centralise&#39; approach as well as the interim benefits of a
    return feed of well-structured, microformat-ready data obtained from their
    existing mess. It also provides a useful test case for a whole-of-government
  implementation.</p>
<h3>Another Example - Education Resource Finder</h3>
<p>Also ripe
    for content aggregation are teacher and education resources. Each cultural
    sector Web site creates hundreds of these as HTML pages, PDFs, microsites. They
    catalogue them in different ways, call them different names, and expect
    time-poor teachers and answer-hungry students to blunder their way through them
  to find what they are looking for.</p>
<p>In the
    education sector [through Education Network Australia (EDNA –
  http://www.edna.org.au) and in NSW the Department of Education and Training&#39;s
  Teacher and Learning Exchange (TALE – <a href="http://www.tale.edu.au/">http://www.tale.edu.au</a>)], education
    specialists and educators themselves have built sophisticated searchable
    databases of relevant content. Whilst EDNA can be accessed by students and
    teachers from their homes, TALE is predominantly a walled-garden Intranet
  system and cannot.</p>
<p>About NSW
    is building another aggregator and cataloguing tool for these resources, and
    connecting them up across the institutions around user-centric topics and
    themes. Resources are being connected with visit trails - encouraging
    real-world excursions as well as content access. Through exposing them in this
    way they can be better indexed for niche audiences and also exposed to wider
  audiences.</p>
<h1>Consumer-Oriented Location-Aware Data Access</h1>
<p>Adrian
    Holovaty quickly rose to fame for Chicago Crime, (<a href="http://www.chicagocrime.org/">http://www.chicagocrime.org</a>)
    a project that made &#39;usable&#39; a mess of data provided by the Chicago Police
    Department (<a href="http://gis.chicagopolice.org/">http://gis.chicagopolice.org/</a>). Whilst the Chicago PD had a
    statutory responsibility to release data about crimes, it had no responsibility
    to make it &#39;user-friendly&#39;. One of the project’s great successes is that it
    doesn&#39;t presume a &#39;correct&#39; way of filtering crime data. Users can browse
    crimes by type, date, location or any permutation thereof. It was also possible
    to use a GoogleMap interface to map out a route through a neighbourhood (for
    example, the daily path you might walk to the station, or to do the shopping)
    and see the frequency and type of crimes that had occurred along that
  particular route.</p>
<p>Unfortunately
    it is rare to find the public release of this kind of data being mandated in
    the way that Chicago PD was. Another project, this time by Stamen Design,
    called Oakland Crimespotting (<a href="http://oakland.crimespotting.org/">http://oakland.crimespotting.org/</a>), tried a
    similar approach to crime in Oakland, only to find that the government
    department sites from which it was scraping data cut their feed. Stamen is now
  working with Oakland City to restore access to data.</p>
<p>Most
    democratic governments already release enormous amounts of data to their
    publics, but rarely is it in a consumer-friendly form. This is often not
    intentional, but the result of the large and sometimes archaic enterprise
  systems in which this data is stored. </p>
<p>The
    cultural sector should know its audiences well. Museum Web sites undergo
    rigorous evaluation and emerge redesigned on a regular basis. But the cultural
    sector is not always the best judge of how other non-cultural sector audiences
    might benefit from its datasets. Nor is there enough research into how users
    might wish to traverse collections from multiple institutions using an artist&#39;s
  name, a particular date or a place as their guide.</p>
<p>There are
    good examples from the library world of ways that enterprise data can be
    recontextualised and given new life. Much in the same way that some library
    catalogues use the Amazon database (<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com/</a>) to pull in images
    and related works for library patrons, commercial projects like Library Thing
    (<a href="http://www.librarything.com/">http://www.librarything.com</a>) now connect to library catalogues to make it
  easier for their customers to form &#39;collections&#39;.</p>
<h2>An Example - Federated Location-Centric Search, Mysuburb</h2>
<p>For the
    About NSW project pilots, we chose to focus on making a cross-sector collection
    search location-aware. The broad concept behind the MySuburb prototype is
    similar to that used by Holovaty&#39;s most recent commercial project, Everyblock
    (<a href="http://www.everyblock.com/">http://www.everyblock.com</a>). Where Everyblock is a location-sensitive news
    aggregator which shows all the news related to a &#39;place&#39;, MySuburb uses the
    same start point - where you are - to begin a federated search of cultural
    collections. Similarly, with the growth of location-aware mobile devices,
    institutions in the cultural sector need to explore the issues involved in
    making their data location-aware so that they can best prepare for future
  delivery methods.</p>
<p>There are
    several complex problems needing to be solved to make this work in a
  customer-centric and seamless manner. </p>
<p>First,
    very few cultural collections are geo-tagged. If they are, then they are tagged
    in different ways. Taking the Powerhouse Museum&#39;s own collection, we discovered
    that out of nearly 70,000 collection records publicly available on our Web
    site, only 17,000 had any data in a set of fields relating to &#39;place&#39;. Of those
    17,000 with data, there were only 1,100 unique places. Because places are not
    recorded in the Powerhouse collection management system with a controlled
    vocabulary, there is great inconsistency in how place data is recorded. Some
    objects have a granularity down to the suburb level whilst most are only down
  to the city or even state level. </p>
<p>Further,
    in the Powerhouse collection there is a wealth of &#39;unstructured&#39; place-related
    data - just not in the &#39;place&#39; field. Instead, places, even down to the street
    level, are stored in context in rich statements of significance or in
  production notes. </p>
<p>Over at
    the Australian Museum, species data are publicly available based on collection
    locations - not a good indicator of the locations of living populations. And at
    the Art Gallery of NSW, artists have limited public location data attached to
    them, but not to the works that they have produced throughout their career. In
    contrast, the NSW Heritage Office has street addresses of all of the registered
  properties which have heritage value.</p>
<h2>Cleaning Up Place Data</h2>
<p>For those
    objects that have structured place data, we need to perform some cleaning up
    tasks before determining their latitude and longitude. By harnessing several
    publicly available Web services, About NSW is able to make better sense of incomplete
    place data. First, data are scraped from existing fields and fed through the
    Flickr API (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">http://www.flickr.com/services/api/</a>), to return as structured XML
    the possible locations with parent data. In this way we are able to turn
    &#39;Sydney&#39; into &#39;Sydney, New South Wales, Australia&#39;. Flickr does not offer a
    latitude and longitude resolution service, so the Geonames service
    (<a href="http://www.geonames.org/export/">http://www.geonames.org/export/</a>) is used to convert this improved location
    data into latitude and longitude co-ordinates. These are then able to be mapped
    on Google Maps and manipulated mathematically to be able to show other content
  within a specified radius.</p>
<p>For
    objects with unstructured place data that exists only in large blocks of text,
    the process is more complex. We are first piloting with the Powerhouse
    collection a process which involves the parsing of the descriptive fields in
    object records for &#39;possible&#39; place matches, based on regular expressions. Once
    processed, we are then able to compare each possible place with a list of
    &#39;known&#39; places. Currently we use the NSW Department of Lands place database,
    the Geographical Names Register of NSW (<a href="http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name_search">http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name_search</a>)
    which contains over 80,000 placenames including historical data and alternative
    namings. In the future it would be possible to use the same methodology to
    include other lists of placenames such as indigenous placenames, as well as
  contested maps and territories.</p>
<p>This
    newly cleaned structured data can also be returned to the participating
    institutions to improve their own datasets within their own organisations.
    Improved geo data are of enormous benefit to institutions beginning to
    conceptualise their own location-aware projects and will allow them to be
  better ready for location-sensitive data delivery ( Bearman and Geber, 2007).</p>
<h2>Cross-Linking Cultural Content On A Map</h2>
<p>The
    project team is well aware that simply making cultural content available on a
    map interface is not enough. To tap into other audiences, the project is
    experimenting with mapping other publicly available data around known
    location-centric interests - news content, demographics, real estate
    information - tapping practical concerns and using these as alternative
  entry-points into layers of cultural content. </p>
<p>These
  datasets are visualised on a combination navigation map and chloropleth. </p>
<p>Once the
    data become available, users will be able to visit MySuburb and map heritage
    buildings, discover famous historical figures and events from their suburb,
    discover flora and fauna in the local environment, and then use all the data as
  starting points to explore cultural collections. </p>
<p>Overlaid
  across this data can be other demographic content.</p>
<p>We are
    initially experimenting with baby name data from NSW Registry of Births, Deaths
    and Marriages. This information is  very popular and is publicly released as a table of
    popular names each year on the Births, Deaths and Marriages site
    (<a href="http://bdm.nsw.gov.au/popularBabyNames.htm">http://bdm.nsw.gov.au/popularBabyNames.htm</a>). We have built a simple tool to
    allow it to be explored interactively, and it will soon be mappable - showing
    popular birthnames by year and place - revealing the patterns of community
    naming through time and space. We are exploring whether names can then also be
    used as a casual entry point to cultural collections; for example, &#39;show me all
    the work held in the Art Gallery by Australian artists named William&#39; from my
  suburb.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>About NSW
    provides a case study for the potential of cultural sector data. Freed from the
    usability problems of enterprise systems and connected to other similar data
    held elsewhere, About NSW is enabling wider exposure of the state’s collection
  data, events calendars and educational resources. </p>
<p>Whilst
    traditional approaches would mandate a complex process of top-down
    standardisation for known audiences, the About NSW approach is a more practical
    and less restrictive and cumbersome, more agile bottom-up process. The project
    acknowledges that it does not know how users will eventually end up using the
    data made available, but instead attempts to make the data available in as many
    formats as possible and with as little impact on the source institution as
  possible.</p>
<p>The
    project is still very much in its infancy.  Future research is required to
    assess its success or failure, as well as detailed investigative work to find
  out how data end up being utilised.</p>
