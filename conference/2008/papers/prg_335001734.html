<p>Few would dispute the claim that museums have an obligation
    to reach out and meet the learning needs of non-traditional audiences. In order
    to do so, it is essential for museums and cultural institutions to meet those
    needs through an open-ended, systemic commitment to diversity and power sharing
    (Karp, Kreamer, &amp; Lavine 1992). Recently released in the Saint Louis
    Science Center&#39;s (SLSC) Strategic Vision Statement, the institution vowed to
    meet the future achievement needs of non-traditional audiences by “sustaining
    lifelong science and technology learning for a diverse audience of youth,
  parents, and teachers” (Saint Louis Science Center, 2008). </p>
<p>This paper is not a discussion of how to involve
    underrepresented audiences with museums. Rather, it is a description of how the
    SLSC utilizes Web 2.0 technology to capture, highlight, and deepen those
    interactions. It should be noted that technology alone is not sufficient to
    draw into museums audiences that have traditionally been intimidated, ignored,
    or unwelcome within cultural institutions. To change the diversity of a museum
    audience, the museum itself must change. Participatory technology can become a
    part of the vehicle with which museums begin to reinvent themselves and make
  themselves open to the needs of new audiences.</p>
<p>If the images and words of underrepresented audiences are
    featured without effect on the majority standard, the community is given input
    without impact. Offering voice to communities without giving power relegates their
    position to one of &#34;tokenism&#34;. (Association of Science and Technology
    Centers, 1998). Museum Web professionals are not immune from this danger:
    representations of museum audiences often fall to the museum Web site. The
    commitment to diversity must extend beyond the act of designing Web pages with
  photos of African-American children in the galleries.</p>
<p>As a historical enabler of racism, the field of science (and
    by extension, science museums) has a particular responsibility to contribute to
    the collective positive imagery and artifact of African Americans and other
    minority groups engaged with science. To capture and distribute this content in
    an authentic way<b>, a science museum must first be a place where African
  American and other minority groups engage with science.</b></p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p><i>Youth Exploring Science</i> (YES) is an extensive work-based science outreach program targeted to urban youth
    facing multiple risk factors. YES teens demonstrate confidence in various
    scientific disciplines by engaging in inquiry-based Learning Labs and
    work-based skill workshops. Teens also demonstrate their understanding of core
    STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) concepts by facilitating
    hands-on activities, workshops, and demonstrations to a variety of public
  audiences. </p>
<p>Currently, the YES program works with 150 teens, with an
    institutional commitment to enlarge the program 10% per year for the next 10
    years (Saint Louis Science Center, 2008.) The teens are divided into 5
    sub-components, focusing on various science-related topics, including system
    dynamics, renewable energy, and chemistry. The components meet every Saturday
    during the school year, and five days a week during the summer. YES teens are
  paid minimum wage, working as hourly employees of the SLSC.</p>
<p>A majority of YES participants graduate from high school;
    they pursue higher education at significantly higher rates than their fellow
    classmates do. Of the 2007 senior YES cohort, 30 out of 32 teens graduated from
    high school, and 29 continued their education at two- or four-year colleges and
    universities. This graduation rate (93.75%) compares to the 55% high school
    graduation rate of Saint Louis Public Schools (SLPS), the base school district
    of the SLSC and the majority school district of YES teens (Gay, 2007). The
    college attendance rate of SLPS students is currently in dispute; however, the
    percentage was recently a major factor in the decision to strip accreditation
  from the district.</p>
<h2>Identity</h2>
<p>The YES program has long struggled with its identity, both
    inside and outside the institution. The program is centered in a facility that
    lies a quarter mile away from the “main” SLSC building. Although the site, the
    Taylor Community Science Resource Center, is a spacious, custom-renovated
    facility perfectly suited for the program, its physical disconnection from the
    museum has become a barrier. In fact, only recently have YES teens been
  incorporated into positions within the museum’s galleries. </p>
<p>Weaving 150 teen employees into the fabric of an institution
    is not without its challenges. Perceptions of the teens are varied: not all
    staff in the institution have the same high expectations of the teens as the
    Community Science staff do. During a citywide power outage in the summer of
    2006, the help of the YES teens was requested as the SLSC opened as a cooling
    center. The staff hoped that the teens would be utilized as trained and
    experienced facilitators of hands-on science activities for the community
    members seeking air-conditioned shelter in the museum. The planned role for the
    YES teens turned out to be one of physical labor: rearranging furniture in the
  museum (Polman and Miller, 2007).</p>
<p>A separate incident that occurred earlier in May, 2006, had
    already cemented the Community Science department’s drive to take control of
    the identity of the YES program. An article was published for a local paper and
    highlighted the institution’s commitment to education through an interview with
    the president of the SLSC. He talked extensively about the YES program, and one
    of three accompanying pictures bore the caption “Douglas King, president &amp;
  CEO of the Saint Louis Science Center, poses with a group of YES teens.” It was
  an extremely positive article, except for one issue: the students in the
  picture were <i>not</i> YES teens. It was a
    picture of the president with a group of adolescents from a collaborating
  school in light blue shirts, many of whom happened to be African American.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="graville_fig1.graville.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="298"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 1 : Screenshot of Saint Louis Commerce Magazine’s
  Article “Saint Louis Science Center: One of the Five Greats” <a href="http://www.stlcommercemagazine.com/archives/may2006/science_center.html">http://www.stlcommercemagazine.com/archives/may2006/science_center.html</a></p>
<p>After the article was published, many on staff in the
    Community Science department (which runs the YES program ) were bothered by the
    inaccurate depiction of the YES teens. Questions arose about the lack of
    attention to detail from the “main building”; rumors and conspiracy theories
    spread. In the end, it was discovered that the paper had specifically requested
    a picture of YES teens with the president. Due to a lack of consistent image
    production management in the Community Science Department, none were available.
    Someone in an outside department found a picture of what appeared to be YES
  teens in their light blue uniform shirts, and submitted the picture. </p>
<p>At that point, it became clear that there was a need for an
    organized plan to guide the creation and management of digital assets This plan
    needed to meet the greater goal of using these digital assets to respectfully
    represent YES teens and their valuable but often unnoticed and overlooked
    contributions to the Saint Louis Science Center as a whole. Led by the
    framework of Dr. Eric Jolly&#39;s &#34;Model for Community Change,&#34; the
    department translated the guidelines for “physical” community involvement and
    diversity outreach into the guidelines for “virtual” community involvement and
    diversity outreach. The Community Science department chose to take on the role
    of identity facilitator for the YES program. This initiated the “positive
    education” of both internal and external audiences through proactive production
    and distribution of YES media content (Association of Science and Technology
  Centers, 1998).</p>
<p>The current SLSC institutional Web site is run by a rigid
    content management system designed by an outside firm. It is, by design, a
    marketing-driven site. Before a YES Web site was built, the teens&#39; work was highlighted
    with science- fair style posterboards displayed throughout the building, and
    was not accessible for public showcase other than through museum related
    sessions, a brief description on http://<a href="http://www.slsc.org/">www.slsc.org</a>, donor
  newsletters, and occasional articles. </p>

<p class="caption">Fig 2 : Screenshot of the YES Program page on the main
  Saint Louis Science Center website. <a href="http://www.slsc.org/content.aspx?id=360"> http://www.slsc.org/content.aspx?id=360</a></p>
<p>The decision was
    made to create for the YES program a separate Web site that would be managed
    within the Community Science department. It would be hosted by an outside
    company, and serve as the main portal of information about the YES program,
  with both basic program information and highlights of the teens&#39; work.</p>
<h1>Why Web 2.0?</h1>
<p>The Community Science department has long struggled to
    highlight the work of the YES teens in respectful, mutually beneficial ways. Because
    of the extensive, multi-faceted nature of the program, materials such as
    brochures or static Web sites offer superficial insight. Having the teens
    create artifacts solely for grant evaluation or donor cultivation is at best inauthentic,
    and at worst “tokenism.” With increasing numbers of YES participants, multiple
    NSF grants, and growing national attention, the YES program needed to take
  charge of their media.</p>
<p>Web 2.0 met the first set of requirements outlined by the
  department: it is</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cheap</li>
  <li>Easy</li>
  <li>Able
    to handle multiple authors</li>
  <li>Immediate</li>
  <li>Updatable</li>
</ul>
<p>When the secondary set of goals were outlined for the new
    site, they only reinforced the appropriateness of utilizing the participatory
    technologies of Web 2.0 for the new site, <a href="http://youthexploringscience.com/">http://youthexploringscience.com</a>.
  The goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To
    create a vehicle for showcasing and deepening the science inquiry of YES teens,
    both to internal and external audiences</li>
  <li>To
    introduce authentic technology experiences to YES teens through participation
    in viable Web communities, and aggregate all of those artifacts in one place</li>
  <li>To
    provide a relevant forum for the literacy growth of site participants,
    including reading, writing and critical thinking, by way of publishing
    personal, academic, and work-based reflections</li>
  <li>To
    contribute to the collective imagery and artifact of African American and other
    minority groups engaged in STEM, providing associative models for urban youth
    to see “their own” reflected within the culture of science.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current Web site was created with Drupal by the
    Educational Technology Manager and the Project Supervisor for the YES-2-TECH
    project, and launched in November 2006. The teens began using the site in
  January of 2007.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="graville_fig3.graville.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="400" height="239"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 3 : Screenshot of the Youth Exploring Science Web site <a href="http://www.youthexploringscience.com/">http://www.youthexploringscience.com</a></p>
<p>It was important that the new Web 2.0 efforts align with the
    established learning philosophies of the department, including
    ‘constructionism’. The teens are not viewed as passive recipients in the transfer
    of knowledge from YES supervisors; they are seen as actively constructing their
    own knowledge through exposure and experiences. These teens are more likely to
    construct knowledge when also engaged in the creation of a corresponding
    external artifact that can then be reflected upon and shared with others (Kafai
    and Resnick, 1996). Participatory technology has the capacity to aid the
    construction of meaningful artifacts within the learning process; it was hoped
    that <a href="http://www.youthexploringscience.com/">http://www.youthexploringscience.com</a> could
  capitalize on that power.</p>
<h1>Youth Exploring Science</h1>
<h2>Blogging</h2>
<p>YES teens post weekly blogs about their learning labs and
    respond to comments from other teens, staff and partnering science and
    engineering professionals. Three major considerations in the way that media are
    created and managed by staff correspond to the risk factors that many of the
  YES teens face.</p>
<p>The blogs are written and posted directly to the site,
    without a &#34;queue.&#34; One important pedagogical benefit of blogging is
    the immediacy it provides to users: by making the teens wait for someone to
  &#34;approve&#34; posts, that advantage is negated (Kajder &amp; Bull, 2003).
    In addition, this creates an atmosphere of suspicion: what might you post that
    is inappropriate? For a large number of YES participants that attend failing
    schools, mistrust permeates the social atmosphere traditionally associated with
    learning. The YES program constantly strives to reshape the students&#39;
    perceptions of learning, learning environments, their own intellect,
    relationships with adults and peers, and their future orientation. It was important
    to establish a workflow that reflected that effort. The site has adopted the
    policy of &#34;radical trust&#34; with the teens; and it has yet to be even
  minimally violated (Spadaccini &amp; Chan, 2007).</p>
<p>Teens are allowed to post unedited by staff: although this
    leads to grammar errors, content inaccuracy, and spelling mistakes, it is a
    respectful way to honor and therefore encourage teen participation in the site.
    Coaching YES teens toward the “formal register” utilizing standard English,
    grammar and syntax is part of the blogging process; however, all thoughts,
    reflections and contributions are given the same value (Payne, 1998). Growth in
    blogging skills (and underlying literacy) is a process; stunting this through
  &#34;school-like&#34; monitoring and correction would simply feed back into
  negative associations with formal education.</p>
<p>The risk factor of generational poverty has associated
    implications with two-way communication; therefore the staff takes great care
    in utilizing the comment function of the blog. While embedded into face-to-face
    practice, all staff are coached into using the “adult” voice when commenting to
    teens’ posts. This means supervisors must remain non-judgmental, and factual,
    with a win-win attitude, when responding to the teens’ writings. For teens that
    grow up in generational poverty, hearing the patronizing, authoritative, and
    critical “parent voice” can be unbearable, and at the very least inhibits
    positive supervisor-teen interactions (Payne, 1998). Questions and comments from
    staff are formulated to draw deeper reflections from the teens, not to “correct”
    information. The post below shows a posting from a teen after a learning lab
    that was extremely disruptive and unproductive. The post includes a supervisor
  response that uses the “adult voice.” </p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">WWwwhaaaaaooo booooy!! . . idk</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Today we DidN&#39;t have a usual saturday session. From
    the outside looking in one would suspect that we(learning places as a whole)
  didnt make that much progress-----but in actuality we did.</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Right arounnd about 12 o&#39;clock the learning lab got a
    little out of control. Mesa, the HEad SUpervisor(haha felixlol), took it upon
    herself to confront us learning places teens of our unproffesional behavior. to
    make a long story short---------we ended up having an interesting discussion
    where we brainstormed, reflected, dicussed etc ways to better conduct our LP
    work. This discussion was beneficial. Both the supervisors and teens
    appropriately expressed thier greivances but also admitted to their
  mistakes.---------------the end.</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"><b>Supervisor

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I agree that sometimes you must go backwards in order
    to move ahead. I&#39;m glad that you still felt that you got things accomplished
    today in lab. I&#39;m also glad that would could all have a very mature
  conversation about how to make our work more productive. (<a href="http://youthexploringscience.com/blog/colin001/wwwwhaaaaaooo-booooy-idk">http://youthexploringscience.com/blog/colin001/wwwwhaaaaaooo-booooy-idk</a>)</p>
<p>Rather than chastising the teen, the staff member moves the
    issue forward on an encouraging note. This honors the teens posting while
  constructively moving the situation to a positive place for the next meeting. </p>
<h2>Flickr</h2>
<p>As the originator of the “call to action”, the Community
    Science Department solved the photo management problem by department-wide use
    of Flickr (<a href="http://youthexploringscience.com/blog/kiontey001/is-yes-2-tech-still-trying-to-save-energy-yes-they-are-and-doing-a-good-job-at-it">http://www.flickr.com</a>). Flickr has impacted the way Community
    Science operates by investing all teens and staff in creating visual records of
    their activities. Digital photography has become a standard element of every
    YES learning lab and Community Science event. All YES components shoot, upload,
  categorize, describe and tag their digital photos through Flickr. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="graville_fig4.graville.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="400" height="310"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 4: Screenshot of the &#34;youthexploringscience&#34;
  Flickr page, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/youthexploringscience/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/youthexploringscience/</a></p>
<p>Over 9,000 photos have been uploaded to date. This has made
    requests for pictures a non-issue, as any member of staff can now easily access
    and retrieve specific full-resolution pictures through the collection,
    category, and tag features. To take advantage of the vast collection, random
    pictures from the Flickr photostream are fed into <a href="http://www.youthexploringscience.com/">http://www.youthexploringscience.com</a>,
    offering visitors and members alike a new set of pictures on every page. The
  pictures of ‘youthexploringscience’ have been viewed over 12,400 times. </p>
<p>Flickr’s basic features have reinforced the goals of the YES
    program in unexpected ways. The City Science lab component of YES used Flickr
    photo notes for identifying different colonies of bacteria culled from the
    building, capitalizing on a feature that many teens were familiar with from
    Facebook and repurposing it for an extended scientific experience. The teens
    immediately connected with the ‘scientific’ purpose of using photo notes: as
  scientists, they had an obligation to report their data.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="graville_fig5.graville.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="399" height="308"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 5: Screenshot of &#34;fred+marwin&#39;s dish&#34; on

<p>Flickr also offered a way to fulfill one of the more
    abstract goals of the Web site. After tagging all 9,000 pictures “Saint Louis
    Science Center” and “Scientist, ” it is hoped that the YES teens will become a
    part of the collective identity of both terms. The sheer volume of photos has
    made the YES program the face of the Saint Louis Science Center within the
  Flickr community. </p>
<h2>Instructables</h2>
<p>In the Summer of 2007, the YES-2-TECH component was looking
    for a dissemination outlet for the plans for their low-cost geodesic dome. The
    component had re-engineered an expensive geodesic dome to be affordably built
    for local community groups and food shelters. The respective purposes for the
    dome, as an outdoor classroom and as a supplemental food source, resonated so
    strongly with the teens that they wanted to broaden the impact of their work.
    The determined avenue was the creation of an <b>Instructable</b>. (Instructables (<a href="http://www.instructables.com/">http://www.instructables.com</a>)
    is a collaborative “how-to” Web site that makes designing and posting
    instructions easy.) The content was available from previous postings on the
  blog and the Flickr site. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="graville_fig6.graville.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="399" height="293"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 6: Screenshot of YES-2-TECH&#39;s Geodesic Dome Greenhouse on
  Instructables <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Geodesic-Dome-Greenhouse/"> http://www.instructables.com/id/Geodesic-Dome-Greenhouse/</a></p>
<p>The YES-2-TECH group created a 31-step instructable on how
    to build a geodesic dome greenhouse. It won first prize in the
  &#34;Go-Green&#34; contest co-sponsored by treehugger.com and Popular
    Science, and runner-up in the &#34;Science Fair&#34; contest sponsored by
    Amazon.com. The two awards have allowed the teens’ work to gain attention from
    both outside and inside the institution. The project was featured in an article
    on treehugger.com. The instructable itself has been viewed 8,360 times, and has
    a community rating of 24. Perhaps most importantly, it has 25 mostly
    content-based comments from Instructable community members, offering either
  respect for the design or suggestions for improvement. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="graville_fig7.graville.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="400" height="429"/></p>

  Greenhouse on Instructables <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Geodesic-Dome-Greenhouse/"> http://www.instructables.com/id/Geodesic-Dome-Greenhouse/</a></p>
<p>The prestige of being associated with Popular Science,
    treehugger.com, and Amazon.com has gained the teens’ work a greater level of
    visibility and respect with internal audiences as well. The “award winning”
    Instructable not only allowed the teens to showcase their complex
    accomplishment of designing and building the geodesic dome, but also deepened
  the experience through collaborative writing and production. </p>
<h1>The Results</h1>
<h2>Teen Engagement</h2>
<p>To make blogging a part of the teen program first required
    multiple technology professional development sessions with staff. The topics
    ranged from posting blogs and downloading pictures to the deeper pedagogical
    issues of using participatory technology to facilitate inquiry, and blogging to
    deepen the teens’ scientific content mastery. As of Fall ’07, all components of
  the YES program were blogging regularly. </p>
<p>From data-entry-style posts January of 2007, to
    audience-directed musings in January 2008, many teens have begun to show growth
    as authors on the blog. These teens are becoming more cognizant of their
    audiences, especially the Internet-at-large. In the first post below, the teen
    gave a relatively bland summary of the day’s events. In the second post a year
    later, the teen not only began to address the reader, but she also shows
  personality and expresses opinions, all while discussing scientific content. Samples follow:</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Is Yes-2-Tech Still Trying To Save
  Energy?.........Yes, They Are And Doing A Good Job At It!!!!</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">There were many things that were accomplhished today
    in Yes-2-Tech. Like we first had to find out which type of car we would want in
    the future and how much everything would cost and how long would the car last
    but that was just the start of it. Then after we figured the prices of
    everything for a car that all led up to the fact that we are still building and
    making wind turbines for our domes. So we went on <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/A-Home-Power-Plant---Wind-Power-Generator-Revised/">http://www.instructables.com/id/A-Home-Power-Plant---Wind-Power-Generator-Revised/</a> to find out the different types of wind turbines that were all over the country
    that could be made and this is the one that I found the most well organized and
    has complete instructions on how to make the turbine. The name of this turbine
    is Home Power Plant and some other things that I found from this instructable
    was that the turbine had a average watts of 1000 and that the wind has to blow
    at least 20 MPH to reach this rate. Then I figured that the price of the
    supplies would be varied because of the different amounts that would needed to
    be supplied. But I personally think that with a few days of experimenting more
    then we would be able to do this and make our own instructable yet again. But
    then at the same time I think that we could try to make the turbine that we
    looked up a few weeks ago when we called an expert at building turbines and the
    idea that he has could also be a great impact on the production of a wind
    turbine from Yes-2-Tech. So keep checking out my blogs and other blogs from
    Yes-2-Tech to find a weekly update.

<p>Some teens are beginning to develop their own style of
    blogging, occasionally inserting humor and sarcasm as peaceful protests against
    the perceived rigors of the work-based program. These posts are encouraged,
    both to build a sense of ownership of the Web site among the teens, and to add
  general humor for the teens and staff. </p>

    all those dead plants. They were probably crying inside in their last moments

    works like it did when we originally build it, but it&#39;s still hot.

<h2>Evaluation Data</h2>
<p>By virtue of the medium, the artifacts of the teens Web 2.0
    work have created an increasingly vast collection of data for evaluation. Teens
    have been given an authentic space to reflect on their STEM learning. By
    positioning the process of reflection within the relevant avenue of blogging,
    teens have engaged with sharing their growth in STEM content knowledge. Staff
    use the posts on a weekly basis to help gauge growth in STEM content knowledge,
    literacy, and overall connectedness to the larger projects. This internal
    evaluation has shown an increase in audience connection, STEM specific writing,
    and overall participation in blogging. In addition to these internal
    evaluations, the YES-2-TECH component is working with an external evaluator to
    measure the impact of YES programming (specifically the YES-2-TECH component)
  on technology skills. </p>
<p>The Year 3 NSF Evaluation Report for the YES-2-TECH project
    shows that the cumulative Web 2.0 project, the Instructable, was successful not
    only in fostering the technology skills of the teens, but also in deepening their
  STEM experience. The report stated that the project: </p>
<p class="BlockQuote">created a large number of needs and opportunities for STEM
    problem-solving. The teens needed to describe what purpose their geodesic dome
    greenhouse served; document the exact specifications and amounts of the supplies
    needed to create their dome design; capture and place digital photos
    documenting the process of dome construction; draft, revise, and finalize their
    text describing the steps in detail for an audience with the understanding that
    the audience would have only their descriptions to rely on. Along the way, they
    had to overcome problems like how to transfer texts and images, how to describe
    three-dimensional processes, and how to predict trouble spots and prevent them
    through text and images. In order to complete this task, they used a process of
    iterative design, where they drafted text on their blogs, moved their revisions
    to instructables.com, added in images, assessed their needs for more images,
    added in more images and revised their texts again, and presented their
    directions to peers and supervisors multiple times. This iterative design
    process for the website, much like the iterative design process they used to
    create the greenhouse structure during the previous year, was a key to their
    success, and it is also the way that website design is conducted in the real
  world. (Polman, 2007)</p>
<p>Polman (2007) also noted that the Instructables project</p>
<p class="BlockQuote">built on fundamental
    concepts like managing files, copying and editing; utilized contemporary skills of designing text, images,
    and motion pictures to communicate processes and ideas; and fostered the intellectual capability to sustain a complex
  project over a two-month period. </p>
<h2>Impacting Internal Audiences through Reaching External Audiences</h2>
<p>The Youth Exploring Science Web site has proved to be an
    effective tool for communicating with internal audiences. By using the
    submission of an incorrect photo as the initiator of a Web 2.0 campaign, the
    Community Science department opted out of unconstructively reacting to the
    incident and preventing departmental and institutional growth. By creating an
    organized and coherent collection of media, the department is now in the
    position to advocate for the positive and respectful distribution and usage of
  the YES identity.</p>
<p>In many cases the awareness has come from the outside in:
    external attention such as the Instructables awards have given credibility to
    the quality of the teens’ work. Many SLSC staff outside the Community Science
    department used the two awards as a catalyst to visit
    <a href="http://www.youthexploringscience.com/">http://www.youthexploringscience.com</a> for the first time. The reaction has been
    uniformly positive, as the Web site has given the teens’ work a venue to “speak
  for itself.” </p>
<p>The institutional commitment to a ‘community standard’ over
    a ‘majority standard’ is being strengthened by the expression of its diverse
    identities (Association of Science and Technology Centers, 1998). Web 2.0 has
    become a vehicle for both showcasing and deepening the work of the YES teens,
    and aiding the projection of ‘at risk’ urban youth as scientists to audiences
    inside and outside the institution. Photos, blog posts, videos, and other
    digital records and reflections of African Americans engaging in STEM
    activities can serve as associative models for other youth looking to see ‘their
    own’ reflected in the culture of science. Internally and externally, the Saint
    Louis Science Center is becoming known as a place where African American and
    other minority groups engage with science and technology. By facilitating
    diverse representations of their institutional identity, museums can begin to
    reach out to communities in a way that is both sustainable and mutually
  beneficial. </p>
<h1>What’s Next?</h1>
<p>One of the most exciting opportunities for the Community
    Science department results from organizational change: the Community Science
    and the School Programs departments merged to become the School and Community
    Partnerships department. The experience that the YES program has gained through
    its successful science inquiry in out-of-school time will now be utilized
    within formal K-12 education. The programming will still involve both teacher
    professional development and direct-to-student delivery, but it will be
  refocused around the needs of the learners. </p>
<p>It was discovered within the first month of the merge that
    schools were interested not only in the science expertise of the department,
    but also in the use of Web 2.0 technology to deepen engagement and to support
    literacy. This was an unforeseen benefit of both the Web site creation and the
    departmental merger: the School and Community Partnerships Department is now in
    the position to share its experiences with participatory technology within the
  context of science inquiry. </p>
