        <p class="AbstractText"><i>WatWasWaar.nl</i> is a
        recently-released national platform for historical-geographical information in
        the Netherlands. This joint initiative of over 25 cultural heritage
        institutions provides the general public with easy access to historical data
        with a location component. WatWasWaar.nl caters for the broad interest in local
        history that was reconfirmed by recent research conducted by the Dutch
        government (Wubs,  2006a, Wubs,  2006b and Huysmans, 2007). This research
        concluded that the main interest of the general public regarding cultural
      heritage on-line focuses on family history and local history.</p>
      <p class="AbstractText">The adventure of developing this simple, smart, fast and
        fun map-based publication platform started early in 2005. At that time Google
        Maps and Google Earth were still to be launched, and map-based applications
      were ‘for professionals’.</p>
      <p class="AbstractText">Topics addressed are the application itself; focus points
        in the development process; the unique features of the application: the
        combination of the elements of time and space; the content; the users; policy

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="caption"><img src="liberge-figure_1_copy.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="377" height="58"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Logo WatWasWaar.nl</p>
      <p><i>WatWasWaar.nl</i> is the first map-based publication
        platform for historical information on a national level in the Netherlands, and
      very possibly in the world.</p>
      <p>Development
        of the platform started early in 2005. Map-based on-line publication platform
        user interfaces were still in their infancy at this time. Google Earth and
        Google Maps were still to be launched, and map-based publication platforms
        unlocking larger or complex data collections were still predominantly based on
      the design of Geographic Information System (GIS) desktop software.</p>
      <h1>The Key Issues</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>GIS desktop applications enable users to
          generate maps based on mathematically determined queries. Translated to the
          Web, this results in user interfaces with a map based on several variables
          chosen by the user. Making the selection of variables needed to generate a map
          often requires knowledge in advance and is regarded as demotivating, to say the
          least.</li>
        <li>Since maps shown are created upon consumer
          demand, they are mainly generated live (on the fly). This often results in
          map-based platforms which are extremely slow, according to current Web
          standards.</li>
        <li>To navigate the map or access information on
          items on the map, several tools are needed. These tools are generally
          positioned next to the map. Getting users even to notice these tools, let alone
          work with them, is known to be a key usability issue to be tackled.</li>
        <li>The user experience of such user interfaces is
          usually described as: &#34;a Web site for professionals&#34;. Dutch examples of
          such map-based Web sites are <a href="http://www.kaart.nieuwekaart.nl/">www.kaart.nieuwekaart.nl </a>(offering a view of the Netherlands in the future based on present construction
          plans), and <a href="http://www.kich.nl/">www.kich.nl</a> (offering policy
          makers in-depth possibilities to visualize cultural heritage on the map). Since
          they both target a professional audience, the above-noted usability issues play
          less important roles. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="caption"><img src="liberge-figure_2_copy.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="400" height="250"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2: <a href="http://www.denieuwekaart.nl/">www.denieuwekaart.nl</a></p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="liberge-figure_3_copy.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="400" height="301"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 3: <a href="http://www.kich.nl/">www.kich.nl</a> </p>
      <p>The task
        of the WatWasWaar.nl (WWW) team, however, was to design a map-based platform
        targeted at the general public, so these usability issues needed to be
      addressed. </p>
      <h1>Making A Web GIS Simple, Smart, Fast And Fun</h1>
      <p>Luckily
        the WWW team did not have to start from scratch. Since WatWasWaar.nl had a
        map-based predecessor, deWoonOmgeving.nl (no longer on-line), the team could
        build upon previous experience. To tackle the known usability issues while
        focusing on <b>simplicity, smartness, speed</b> and <b>fun</b> was key during the design and development
        process. Owing to the large number of participants in the project and the aim
      of enlarging public access to cultural heritage, <b>findability</b>, <b>accessibility</b> and <b>interoperability</b> also played important roles.</p>
      <h2>Simplicity </h2>
      <p>The
        simplicity of the user interface was envisioned by providing the user with maps
        based on predetermined queries instead of offering user-generated maps based on
        a broad number of variables to be selected. In order to determine these
        queries, location, time, persons, objects and events were chosen as key
        elements in the search for cultural heritage or historical data. Since the WWW
        platform was developed to publish geographical-historical data, location and
        time were taken as focus points. Persons, objects and events were marked as
        linking elements. Apart from location and time, category typology (image,
        audio, text, map, etc) and the source-holding institute were also determined as
      focus points in order to ensure a readable and traceable output. </p>
      <p>This made
        it possible to choose a map-based interface offering a total overview of all data
        available in the system (maps and objects on the map) from the start. In order
        to decrease search results, filtering the results was made possible on the
        basis of location, time, type of data and source-holding institute. Apart from
        the fact that it is possible to publish point and shape data side by side, the
        time-filter deserves extra attention; this is what sets WatWasWaar.nl apart
        from most on-line map-based publication platforms such as Google Maps. The
        time-filter on this map-based platform enables the users to browse through
        geographical-historical data in more than the one-dimensional manner these data
        require, through TIME and SPACE. The time-filter enables users to filter data
        such as images, maps and air views by location and time, offering them the
      possibility of acquiring an overview of the development of the landscape.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 4: Screenshot of filters on <a href="http://www.watwaswaar.nl/">www.watwaswaar.nl</a></p>
      <h2>Smartness</h2>
      <p>Smart
        interaction on the platform was achieved by learning a lot from Google Maps but
        also by moving beyond them. Since the system would contain at least one or more
        items of data per parcel, the use of icons to indicate data on the map was seen
        as problematic. The use of icons in information-dense, map-based publication
        systems often results in the map’s vanishing behind the icons. To prevent this,
        a new feature was introduced. This feature consists of refreshing the list of
        search results shown next to the map on mouseover when scrolling over the map.
        This, and some other changes, made it possible to do away with the navigation
        and information tools positioned next to the map, as well as the use of icons
      on the map. </p>

      mouseover on <a href="http://www.watwaswaar.nl/">www.watwaswaar.nl</a>. </p>
      <h2>Speed</h2>
      <p>The speed
        of the WWW application is mainly secured by caching (storing) the tiles of
        whatever maps in the Web-based GIS systems are used. The rendering of the tiles
        starts fully automatically at the highest zoom level every time new material is
        published. In addition, all maps that are not pre-rendered are rendered upon
        user request and cached for the next user. This results in a platform which is
        actually made faster by frequent usage, although this is of course within
      certain limits.</p>

      Fig 6: Pointer of WatWasWaar.nl. </p>
      <h2>Fun</h2>
      <p>The fun
        part of the platform is provided by the playful and light design of the logo
        and user interface, which contrasts nicely with data often qualified as
        ‘serious’. In addition,  the flexibility of the logo concept enables a
        cross-media communication strategy of which only a fraction has been put into
        practice as yet. Part of the logo concept is the choice of the name.
        ‘WatWasWaar’ has a double meaning. Literally it means ‘What Was Where?’ But it
      can also be read as ‘What Was True?’ - indicating that history can be coloured. </p>

      <h1>Content</h1>
      <p>Just as
        the usability of the application determines its success, the content it
        discloses is key to attracting visitors. WatWasWaar.nl was fortunate that,
        during the creation of its predecessor, twenty pilot projects had been carried
        out exploring the possibilities of linking historical data to location. This
        resulted in WWW’s being able to claim nationwide coverage of every location
      when launched. </p>

      <p>In order
        to facilitate and stimulate the growth of content as much as possible, WWW has
        taken into account that location-based publication of historical data is new to
        most collection-holding institutes. To facilitate and stimulate participation
      and thus the growth of the collection, WWW offers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>advice on location metadata
          management </li>
        <li>assistance with linking collections
          items to locations </li>
        <li>location-based files (tables with
          matching x/y coordinates, postal codes, addresses)</li>
        <li>a simple, expandable and flexible
          data model</li>
      </ul>
      <p>WWW has
        kept the required METADATA to a minimum and made the metadata model flexible
      and expandable.</p>
      <p>Minimum
      metadata required for publication on WWW are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>location (can be x/y coordinates,
          postal code, address or town)</li>
        <li>time (exact date or start and end
          dates)</li>
        <li>descriptions (in the form of a title
          and/or full description)</li>
        <li>source holder</li>
        <li>type of material (geographical point
          or shape data, images, moving images or text)</li>
        <li>More metadata categories can be
          added on demand. </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Users Of WatWasWaar.nl</h1>
      <p>Users of WatWasWaar.nl can be divided into
      two main groups: consumers and participants.</p>
      <h2>Consumers</h2>
      <p>On-line consumers with an interest in
        geographical-historical information were clearly identified, characterised and
        grouped in research conducted by the Dutch government (Wubs, 2006b). In this
        research consumers and potential consumers for WWW are described as those
        members of the Dutch public with an interest or potential interest in their
        personal history, i.e. their family history or the history of their local
        environment. This group consists of 42% of the Dutch population. The total
        population of Holland is more than 16 million people, so this results in 6.7
        million consumers or potential consumers in the national market. This group of
        consumers can be divided into three sub-categories: semi-professionals (A),
        starters among the historical explorers (B) and people with a potential
        historical interest (C). Groups A and B consist of 13% of the population (2.1
        million people). Group C consists of 28% of the population (4.6 million
      people). The interests of the groups are as following:</p>

      Web statistics of various Dutch cultural heritage Web sites in March 2007</p>
      <p><b>Genlias.nl</b> and <b>deWoonOmgeving.nl</b> were taken as the most
        vital indicators for determining targets because WatWasWaar.nl offers
        historical information on locations and persons. Genlias.nl is the largest
        search engine for genealogical data, indicating the popularity of a Web site
        catering to family history interests. DeWoonOmgeving.nl was a first attempt to
      publish historical data in map-based form. Targets were as follows.</p>
      <p>The target numbers for WWW are seen as
        realistic because relatively little effort is put into marketing Genlias.nl and
        deWoonOmgeving.nl, so an increase in visitors is to be expected with an active
        marketing strategy. Making pages of the new platform robot-traceable (think
        Google of Yahoo) to a deep level was seen as an option for increased 
      findability and thus higher visitor statistics.</p>
      <p>In order to reach the targets, a
      communication strategy was developed of which the following elements are vital:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>actively
          increasing public reach by:
            <ul>
              <li>launching
                WWW as a public event on Cultural Heritage Day</li>
              <li>presenting
                WWW at events visited by the target audience such as the <i>50+ beurs</i> (national over-50s fair) and the <i>Woonbeurs</i> (national home and household fair)</li>
              <li>media
                coverage</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>continuously
          adding new content through:
            <ul>
              <li>acquisition
                of new content participants</li>
              <li>broadening
                the partnership with current participants</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>continuous
          improvement of the user interface and adding new features and services</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Collaborators</h2>
      <p>The participants can be divided into two
      groups: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>prosumers
        (consumers contributing content)</li>
      <li>participants
        (cultural heritage institutions contributing content).</li>
    </ul>
      <p>The development of WatWasWaar.nl consists
        of several stages. The first stage was to get the map-based publication
        platform up and running and then provide it with content; in the following
        stages more services and products can be added. Public participation, and thus
      catering for prosumers, is seen as an extra service to be developed in the future.</p>
      <p><b>Potential participants </b>are all institutions with relevant collections. In practice these
      are often archives, museums and libraries.</p>
      <p><b>Current participants </b>are the National Archive, and all regional archives, the Dutch Land
        Registry Office and archives and/or museums of larger cities and smaller
        regions. An up-to-date overview of participants can be found on <a href="http://www.watwaswaar.nl/">www.watwaswaar.nl</a>. Whilst some participants
        themselves apply to participate, WWW also actively approaches organisations and
      requests them to participate, and also seeks funding to generate content.</p>
      <p>WWW offers participants:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>access to the
          map-based publication platform dedicated to historical data and targeted
        at the general public</li>
      <li>the
        possibility of publishing geographical point and shape data next to
        traditional data such as images (including moving images), text and maps.</li>
      <li>advice and
        support when dealing with collections with a location component</li>
    </ul>
      <p>The <b>additional value </b>for participants consists of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an extra
          window on their collection</li>
        <li>a rise in the
          number of on-line consumers of their collection</li>
        <li>exposure of
          their institute on a national platform</li>
        <li>publicity for
          their collection in national WWW publicity campaigns and actions</li>
        <li>simultaneous
          publication of their collection on other map-based platforms such as <a href="http://www.kich.nl/">www.kich.nl</a> or Google Earth, in addition to
          WWW</li>
        <li>the
          possibility of co-operation not open to small or single parties such as:
            <ul>
              <li>a permanent
                WWW icon in the Google Earth toolbar indicating the layer dedicated to
                WWW content (negotiation phase)</li>
              <li>collaboration
                with real estate Web sites (currently being researched)</li>
              <li>cross-media
                spin-offs such as cultural heritage GPS tours (currently being
                researched)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Organisation And General Policy Goals</h1>
      <p>A small team takes care of the
        policy-making and carries out the daily tasks at WWW. This team operates under
        the juridical form of a foundation. Participants can take a seat on the board
        advising the WWW team. The board meets six times a year. Participants are also
      consulted during the two annual meetings organised specially for participants.</p>
      <p>WWW is financed by the Dutch State through the Department of Education, Culture and Science (<i>Ministerie van Onderwijs Cultuur en Wetenschap</i>). Under the current financial structure,
        participants also contribute financially in the form of an annual fee (variable
      according to the size of the participating institute).</p>
      <p>In 2009, a new financial structure will be
        introduced. This is currently under debate. WWW is striving towards financial
      independence for the permanent costs and the abolition of participants’ fees.</p>
      <p>The funding of a map-based publication
        platform for geographical-historical data by the state is not an isolated
        initiative. The development of WWW is part of broader vision developed by the
      Dutch government to stimulate the public reach of cultural heritage. </p>
      <p>This plan consists of the digitalisation of
        several key collections under the care of Dutch cultural heritage institutes.
        The first cadastral map of The Netherlands is considered one of these
        collections. The development of several national on-line publishing platforms
        to make these digital collections easily accessible is another part of this
        plan. In addition to WWW, the portal <a href="http://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/">www.geheugenvannederland.nl</a><a href="http://www.geugenvannederland.nl/"></a> is an example of such a platform. The next step is to interlink these
        platforms. The technology to reach this goal may be provided by search and
        annotation software, presented at Museums and the Web  2007 (Ossenbruggen et al., 2007).</p>
      <h1>First Results</h1>
      <p>WWW was launched in September 2007. The
        results of the first four months have been very positive. The following tables
        show a significant increase in unique visitors, and visits have been completed.
        But the numbers also indicate that more action is still needed to reach the
      targets set. </p>

      <h1>Future Plans</h1>
      <p>In order to meet the targets set, WWW will
      focus on three areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Further
        development of the application</li>
      <li>More content</li>
      <li>Publicity</li>
    </ul>
      <h2>Further Applications</h2>
      <p>Since WWW contains not only historical data
        with location components but also data with information on private persons, the
        data in WWW are also of great interest to genealogists. Because of the huge
        existing interest in such data, making the data accessible by full text search
      will be one of the first new features to be introduced. </p>
      <p>Other products and services on the WWW list
      are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A widget for
        participants to indicate participation in WWW on their own site.</li>
      <li>The
        introduction of mywww.nl for a more personalised experience, offering an
        overview of last search orders, recent search results, and an overview of
        related content on other locations on the Web.</li>
      <li>The
        projection of scanned images and maps in the map-based interface, creating
        the opportunity to walk through this material alongside the digital maps.</li>
      <li>The extension
        of the on-site map to a full-screen version on top of which the menus will
        be placed, as for game interfaces.</li>
    </ul>
      <h2>Content Development</h2>
      <p>The growth of content will be stimulated
      by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Acquisition
        of new participants and collections.</li>
      <li>Interlinking
        WWW with platforms such as <a href="http://www.kich.nl/">www.kich.nl</a> and <a href="http://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/">www.geheugenvannederland.nl</a>, and the exchange of content.</li>
      <li>Offering an
        API to create map-based mash-ups on the basis of the WWW map to make
        participation even more worthwhile.</li>
      <li>The
        introduction of a geo metadata standard, use of which is required in
        government-funded digitising projects. In addition, the placement of
        government-funded digitised data in WWW will be mandatory.</li>
    </ul>
      <h2>Publicity</h2>
      <p>Publicity will be generated by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Communicating
        the introduction of new collections and services.</li>
      <li>Adding famous
        collections such as the maps of Willem Blaeu.</li>
      <li>Adding fun
        collections such as an overview of haystacks and ship wrecks.</li>
      <li>Adding
        theme-based collections, linked, for example, to the Second World War or
        to slavery.</li>
    </ul>
