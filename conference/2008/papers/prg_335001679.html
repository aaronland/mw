        <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText">Artists and
    master-printers have a long and rich tradition of collaboration and it is
    instructive to consider the Internet through the prism of printmaking. The art
    and craft of printmaking affords a collapsing of barriers not only between
    production and distribution but also between the traditional role of
  &#34;craftsman&#34; and artist. We will always have master printers and
    continue to be the better for it, but no one begrudges an artist the effort of learning
  the same skills solely in the pursuit of their own work.</p>
<p class="AbstractText">Computer programming is the acid bath of the Internet. In
    its purest form it can be harsh and threatening but it is also the vehicle that
    allows a cold sheet of metal becomes a lush and absorbent canvas. All artists
    operate in the space between being experts in the mechanics of their medium --
    few printmakers are also chemical engineers -- and merely consumers of
  prefabricated tools.</p>
<p class="AbstractText">We are still a long way from finding the craft in
    computers which isn&#39;t to say that we all need to learn programming; only that
    we should afford the practice more attention in order to give artists the tools
    to explore and shape a networked world and to bend those tools in to newer one
  just as artists began doing with photography two hundred years ago.</p>
<p class="AbstractText">By encouraging the same latitude of understanding to the
    gory details that govern the Internet we explode the bottleneck that has
  distorted a vast horizon of creation, collaboration and above all mystery.</p>
<p class="AbstractText">To borrow William Gibson&#39;s phrase, to help artists
  &#34;find their own use for things.&#34;</p>

<p class="BlockQuote">&#34;She gestured for the living room, phasing past what
    would&#39;ve been the door to her mother&#39;s bedroom. She&#39;d barely wire framed it,
    here, and there was no there there, no interiority. The living room had its
    sketchy angles as well, and furniture she&#39;d imported from a Playmobil system
    that predated her Sandbenders. Wonkily bit-mapped fish swam past monotonously
    around in a glass coffee table she&#39;d built when she was nine. The trees through
    the front window were older still: perfectly cylindrical Crayola brown trunks,
    each supporting an acid-green cotton ball of undifferentiated foliage. If she
    looked at the tree long enough, the Mumphalumphagus would appear outside,
  wanting to play, so she didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>

  tree.&#34;</p>

<h1>Ceci N&#39;est Pas Un Marteau</h1>
<p>These are not the trumpets sounding. This is not the call to
    smash the clocks. This is not a rebirth; not a death; not even a policy paper.
    This is no more asking a sculptor to become a painter than it is to ask someone
  to believe the tired old saw that, once more, painting is dead.</p>
<p>It is not a story of what we will do but of how we do it. To
    some people there is no difference. The tools are the art. The skill is the
    craft. These are long conversations but the common ground in every point of
    view is that we recognize and value the &#34;craft&#34; in a work of art,
    whether it is the intellectual rigour that underlies the piece or the mastery
  of technique.</p>
<p>An even longer conversation surrounds the unresolved dilemma
    we struggle with trying to open up arts institutions  or explore people&#39;s expectations of what constitutes art
    while still recognizing excellence. I am going to make a claim, tossing it out unanswered because I
    don&#39;t have the answer, and also to make that the point that I am not here to
    tell anyone how to create, judge or fund the place where artists meet computers:
  only that they should explore it and strive to understand it.</p>
<p>When I say computers I really mean programming because it is
    the equivalent of painter&#39;s pigment. When I say artists I really mean art
    schools and museums first, and artists second. But they are all linked, and the
    mechanics of computers and increasingly the Internet have collapsed the
    barriers to creating and sharing works, making it easier to encourage and
    foster discussion and participation – and to share the vision of the
    artist or the curator with more people, more easily and on good days with more
  feedback.</p>
<p>This is a story about plumbing.</p>
<h1>Experts and Consumers</h1>
<p>One way to think about an artist’s relationship with
  computers and computer programming would be to compare it to printmaking.</p>
<p>There is a rich tradition of artists, from a whole range of
    disciplines, working in tandem with Master Printers and creating pieces
    authored by the artists but produced by the print-maker. Born of the not always
    competing desire to produce works that could be seen by as many people as
    possible and the ability to sell multiple versions of the same image,
  printmaking has evolved in to a proper &#34;art form&#34; all it’s own.</p>
<h1>But Is It Art?</h1>
<p>Another way to think about an artist&#39;s relationship with
  computers and computer programming would be to compare it to printmaking.</p>
<p>Threadless.com is a website that solicits designs from users
    all over the Internet and then after a selection process produces limited
    edition print-runs of those designs on t-shirts and sells them to the public at
    large. This is printmaking by any other name and you would be hard-pressed to
    find another medium, in contemporary Western society, with a reach as pervasive
  as the lowly t-shirt.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know whether the people involved in Threadless
    consider themselves artists first, or designers or technologists and I don&#39;t
    care. There is an authentic desire on the part of the people who submit their
    designs to communicate an idea and an aesthetic. These are pillars that
    underline all art whether it speaks to us personally or not. (By all accounts
    it is also fantastically profitable for the company founders but, then again,
    Andy Warhol hardly went lacking either.) What interests me are the affordances
    that the Internet — and the tools and skills used to shape it —
  allows a craft like printmaking to use to investigate new territories.</p>
<h1>Math Is Hard</h1>
<p class="BlockQuote">The Miura Ori was invented by Prof. Koryo Miura at Tokyo
    University&#39;s Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science. The primary intent of
    this fold was for solar panel arrays on satellites: since space comes at a high
    premium when transporting satellites into orbit by rocket, the solar panels
    must fold very compactly. But this must not compromise structural soundness or
  ease of deployment once in orbit.</p>
<p class="BlockQuote">The fold became more widely adopted by manufacturers of
    fold-out maps, which are notorious for binding and tearing if unfolded or
    refolded improperly. Since there is only one natural way the paper
  &#34;wants&#34; to fold and unfold in this arrangement, and since the
    horizontal folds are linked interdependently with the vertical folds, it can be
    easily collapsed and expanded in a single motion. This is therefore most
  commonly known as the Miura map fold.”</p>

<p>No one expects an Origami artist to be a rocket scientist.
    No one expects a photographer or a printmaker to be chemical engineer. Still,
    we teach each enough science to not only develop a roll of film or etch a stone,
    but also to experiment. We teach artists enough of the math and science and
    physics behind a process to give them room to experiment; to do more than
  automate creation.</p>
<h1>My Five Year Old Could Do That</h1>
<p>I attended the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. My
    time there was marked by a tortured relationship with the painting department,
    a love of the printmaking department (but a profound dislike of the actual
    printmaking process) and a feeling that, in 1995 when the Internet was just
    beginning to stretch its arms, maybe there was some room to make capital-A art
  with computers.</p>
<p>I had no idea what this meant; no idea where to begin.
    Eventually I started to create small multimedia pieces, frequently trawling the
    one computer with web access in the photo department for source material, and
    later more complex three-dimensional (3D) models of imaginary spaces and
  eventually the entire ground floor of the school.</p>
<p>Working in a computer generated space offered the chance to
    apply a painter&#39;s license to sculpture without also being bound to the
    constraints of the real world, but I still felt like I was learning only to
    colour by numbers. Eventually, I lost my way completely and now I work as a
  &#34;senior engineer&#34; (that&#39;s computer programmer in English) at Flickr,
  a popular photo sharing website.</p>
<h1>The Shape of Content</h1>
<p>NSCAD was still, then, one of the last bastions of
    Conceptual Art fiercely proud of the role the college has played in movement
    during the 1970&#39;s. One year, the school organized a retrospective including
    re-enactments of pieces, many transitory in nature. Or in the case of the shot
    fired out of a pellet-gun in to the plaster wall, reproduced with the
  &#34;permission of the owner&#34;.</p>
<p>I have never warmed to Conceptual Art. I have always found
    it too dry and intellectual; a problem made worse by the temporal nature of so
    many pieces which were still so meticulously documented, as if only to mock my
  absence more with every passing year.</p>
<p>Recently artists have begun to recreate, with the help of
    programmers and 3D animators, many of those events and performances in Second
    Life, an online shared virtual environment. It doesn&#39;t necessarily make me like
    Conceptual Art any more, but it is a remarkable revisiting and reinterpreting
  of past work and seems strangely suited for virtual environments.</p>
<h1>All Art Is Craft</h1>
<p>Similar collaborations are happening in the world of
    textiles involving touch sensors and interactive fabrics. Many of these
  initiatives partner art schools with engineering departments or business.</p>
<p>Whenever I see talks about these projects I find myself
    asking: &#34;So, are you teaching the artists computer programming yet?&#34;
  The answer is invariably: No, and I&#39;m always left wondering what the artists
  have gotten other than some shiny baubles to play with.</p>
<h1>&#34;API&#34; and &#34;Artspeak&#34;</h1>
<p>&#34;API&#34; is an
    acronym for &#34;Application Programming Interface&#34; which is
    computer-speak for the inputs and outputs that allow two separate computer
  programs to communicate with each other and exchange data.</p>
<h1>Both Start With the Letter &#34;A&#34;</h1>
<p>For example Flickr
    recently announced a partnership with the U.S. Library of Congress  to
    host a small collection of photographs with the hope of encouraging users to
    comment on and document the images. All the photographs in the project, known
    as The Commons, were published under a
    new &#34;license&#34; called
  &#34;no known copyright restrictions&#34; and to date, the project has been a
    huge success, exceeding both Flickr and
  the Library&#39;s expectations.</p>
<p>Not only did
    the Library import the collection in to the Flickr databases programmatically
    using the Flickr API but users all over the world can retrieve those photos,
    and the metadata about them, using the same API. The Library itself does this
    to create a view of both users’ contributions as well the metadata added by its
  staff.</p>
<h1>There Will Always Be Master Printers</h1>
<p>This sort of project
    is why I get up in the morning. I was not even directly involved in The Commons
    but that I am a part of the Flickr team and that Flickr was able to help bring
  this sort of collaboration to fruition makes me extraordinarily proud.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<h1>But We Are All Dan Catt</h1>
<p>In 2005 Flickr already had an API to search for, modify and
    display photographs available on its website. In the spring of that year Google
    released a web-based mapping tool and shortly afterwards an API to display
  markers on those maps dynamically.</p>
<p>By asking people to people tag their photos with the
    necessary geographic information Dan Catt, then living with his family in
    England, was then able to stitch the Flickr API together with the Google API
    and create an entirely new way to visualize those photos, in a website called
  “geobloggers.com”.</p>
<p>So we hired him and eventually build the
  &#34;geotagging&#34; and mapping interface that users see on the site today.
  It gets better.</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> &#34;Not wanting to distract the other engineers with
    questions, requests for php code, special database tables or queries to be
  written and so on, I used the public API, just like anyone else can.&#34;</p>
<p>More recently, we released a new feature called Places which
    is a gazetteer-style view on the iconic photos for places in the world that
    have been geotagged. It was a bit of a surprise at first since Dan prototyped
    the entire thing, in his spare time, using our own APIs. We had no idea this
    was coming but in a way that made it even more special. He was able to take all
    of threads that we expose to the world and fashion it in to something new and
  beautiful.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: Like me, Dan Catt did not study computer
    programming. He studied the arts and motivated by the desire to create and to
    share poked around at the edges of computer programming enough to make it a
  tool like any other.</p>
<h1>What Does It Mean?</h1>
<p>Computer programming can be pretty boring but all artists
    operate in the space between being experts in the mechanics of their medium and
  merely consumers of prefabricated tools.</p>
<p>By encouraging —
  not by mandating — exploration of the gory details that govern how
    computers and the Internet work the same latitude of understanding we can
    explode the bottleneck that otherwise distorts a vast horizon of creation,
  collaboration and above all mystery.</p>
