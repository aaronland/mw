        <p class="AbstractText">Any museum professional will tell you
    that collections are at the heart of what a museum is about. With collection
    sizes typically too large to have everything on display at once, museum Web
    sites have often been called upon to help provide greater access to museum
    objects. The approach, though, is typically one of depth rather than breadth,
    focusing on highlighted objects and curated themes. This can deliver great
    educational content - but how might you build a Web site to represent the
    collections of a museum as a whole?</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">The
    paper sets out to answer this question by way of original research and
    experimentation on real data sets of museum objects, obtained from a number of
    UK museums by way of a Freedom of Information request. These data sources are
    roughly hewn together - a technical and semantic challenge that&#39;s briefly
    explained - to form a single, enormous database.The
    result is a prototype Web   site employing a fresh approach to viewing museum
    collections on-line, eschewing details in favour of high-level overviews and
    visualisations, incorporating user annotations and revealing insights into the
    histories of museum collecting. The &#39;who&#39;, &#39;what&#39;, &#39;where&#39; and &#39;whens&#39; of
    objects are all examined in turn as axis for understanding and grouping
    collections, with the &#39;why&#39; left open for interpretation and comments.</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">Looking forward, the paper asks how  
    museum objects might fit into a &#39;web of data&#39;, where  collections from
    different museums can be compared with each other, and perhaps even with
    private and personal  collections. </p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>A stereotypic description of what&#39;s inside
    museums might be &#39;things in glass cases&#39;. Whilst many museums now contain far
    more than this, delivering an experience that encompasses a whole range of
    presentational devices to tell compelling stories, the collection and display
    of historic objects is nonetheless still at the heart of what museums
    are about.</p>
  <p>Something that&#39;s well known amongst museum staff, but less
    well known to the general public, is the scale of museum objects not on public
    display. Percentages of 10% or less aren&#39;t uncommon, and the sheer size of
    reserve collections can be pretty staggering. At the Science Museum, for
    instance, despite having  60,000 square metres of floor space, there&#39;s still a
    need for two separate off-site object storage facilities. The first is Blythe
    House, a huge building that used to be HQ for the Post Office Savings scheme,
    with over 90 rooms of objects. The second is even bigger, an ex RAF air base, where
    airplane hangars have been converted into huge warehouse-sized storerooms for
    museum objects. Together with the museum, these locations hold over 300,000
    objects.</p>
  <p>As storing vast quantities of objects that nobody knows
    about could be considered a waste of time (and considerable expense), museums
    typically embark upon schemes to give greater access to this untapped
    collection of objects. These can include public tours of the storage facility,
    or temporary exhibitions operating a kind of squad rotation to put different
    objects on public display. A third way, though, is to offer some kind of
    Web-based &#39;access&#39;, which has the advantages of infinite capacity and
    potentially world-wide reach.</p>
  <p>There seem to be two approaches to producing
    collection-based Web sites, both of which will be familiar to the museum
    professional. The first approach is to focus upon interpreting a modest number
    of objects, using curated themes and rich-media to tell stories and deliver
    educational outcomes. Examples of this kind of work from my institution are
    Ingenious (<a href="http://www.ingenious.org.uk/">http://www.ingenious.org.uk</a>), Making the Modern World
    (<a href="http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/">http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk</a>), and an upcoming project, internally
    called &#39;Sickness and Health&#39;.</p>
  <p>The second approach is to transfer a museum&#39;s internal collections
    records into a Web site. This is usually only practical if the records are held
    in an electronic format, and of course you can only publish the data that you
    have ­– and that data may not extend to photographs and well-written
    descriptions of every object. Nevertheless, the result can be a valuable
    resource. Usually the primary user interface is a search box, and the primary
    use is for research purposes. It can be possible to enable a more
    browsing-based interaction, and even serendipitous experiences (see Chan 2007).</p>
  <p>The root of the research that the rest of this paper
    explores, however, comes from an observation that neither of these approaches
    gives much of a sense of the totality of a museum&#39;s collections. Neither offers
    much help in answering the question, &#39;What kind of stuff does this museum
    generally have?&#39; This isn&#39;t, perhaps, the most important question that museum
    Web sites should be answering. Many people will only be interested in a
    particular subset of objects, or in learning about a particular topic. However,
    I think there&#39;s value in attempting to represent the breadth of a museum&#39;s
    collections, and doing so might help to reveal some
    interesting things about a museum&#39;s very identity.</p>
  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>A discussion at the University of Leicester
    kicked off the idea that got me started with this project. An information
    workshop day held before the UK Museums on the Web Conference 2007 looked at
    the creation of &#39;mashups&#39;. Naturally, object databases were  obvious candidates
    for a source of data to &#39;mash up&#39;. A lively debate ensued, where participants
    pointed out the difficulties involved in accessing and combining
    collections data. These difficulties include bad or inaccurate data,
    incompatible meta-data standards, the use of proprietary and difficult-to-handle
    data formats, and so on. Even well-funded, multi-institution projects that aim
    to present a single searchable object repository can be beset with problems.</p>
  <p>In a fit of frustration with these apparent difficulties, I
    suggested that inaccurate data didn&#39;t matter for the purposes a generalized
    aggregate view of the objects and that different meta-data standards could be
    crudely mapped together. The problem of actually getting the data could be
    solved, I suggested, either by screen-scraping an institution&#39;s Web site (a
    common hacker technique which basically parses data out from an automated crawl
    of Web pages), or by simply asking a museum for the data under a Freedom of
    Information request. Whilst someone joked that this might amount to a Denial-of-Service
    attack on a museum&#39;s records department, there was general consensus that this
    could actually work, and I was encouraged to &#39;give it a try&#39;.</p>
  <p>Fast-forward a couple of a months, and I put my money where
    my mouth is by issuing FOI requests to each of the UK&#39;s National Museums (as
    designated by an Act of Parliament). I&#39;m not expecting every museum to comply
    with the request, but I hope that a few will, giving me enough data to get
    started. Meanwhile, I began designing the prototype Web site that will hold
    this data.</p>
  <h1>Architectural Design</h1>
  <p>In designing this prototype Web site, I&#39;ve
    used the framework that&#39;s emerged from recent thinking about designing
    for a &#39;Web of Data&#39;. This concept suggests that Web sites are moving away from
    pages of content, and towards providing representations of large data sets,
    exposing these through Web services as well as HTML pages. These services
    result in a rich set of resources that live beyond a single Web site, and can
    co-exist alongside other services, giving access to different data.</p>
  <p>Tom Coates (Coates, 2006) proposes some key architectural
    principles for building a service that can aggregate with this &#39;Web of Data&#39;.
    One of the first principles he proposes is &#39;to identify your first order
    objects, and make them addressable&#39; (via a unique, persistent identifier). Some
    examples from popular data-driven Web services are &#39;products&#39; on Amazon
    (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/">http://www.amazon.com</a>), &#39;photos&#39; on Flickr (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/">http://www.flickr.com</a>) and &#39;URLS&#39;
    on del.icio.us (<a href="http://www.ingenious.org.uk/">http://www.ingenious.org.uk</a>).  For the purposes of this project, the
    first-order objects are clearly &#39;museum objects&#39;. </p>
  <p>One key attribute which first order attributes need is to be
    clearly discrete. There&#39;s an interesting side-argument here for museum objects,
    which colleagues remind me are notoriously difficult to count. With a stamp
    collection, for example, should the individual stamps count as objects, or
    should the books that contain them count? Whilst there are  some interesting
    metaphysical arguments to be had here, for the purposes of designing a Web site
    exposing museum objects, we can simply defer to the institution as to what
    counts as an single object, and what doesn&#39;t. Whilst this might not be
    standardised, the choices made might actually reveal something about the museum
    - the point of this Web site, after all.</p>
  <p>Having identified our first order objects, and given them a
    URI (see table below), the next architectural principle to follow is to build
    &#39;list views&#39; that can be used to navigate between the first-order objects. For
    examples of these navigations axes, we can turn to Flickr, which has them in
    spades, including all of the following: photographer (user), tags, date taken,
    location, group &#39;pool&#39;, camera model, users who have &#39;favorited&#39; it, and so on.
    Note that some of this data is gathered automatically (date taken and camera
    model), whilst other data is added manually by users (tags and location).</p>
  <p>Museum objects can have a wealth of meta-data surrounding
    them. Indeed, establishing meta-data standards for museum data is something
    that has long been debated by experts. Whilst this is a valid
    activity, for the purposes of this research I am not interested in detailed and
    accurate data for individual objects, but instead in data that can be
    aggregated and used to provide some insights into the collection as a whole.
    This data can be crude and sometimes inaccurate, so long as it&#39;s available for
    a reasonably large portion of the data set.</p>
  <h1>The &#39;5 Ws&#39;</h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">To find these core meta-data axes, I
    turned to the &#39;5 Ws&#39; of journalism,  said to provide the key first bits of
    information: Who, What, Where, When and Why. &#39;<b>Who</b>&#39; is a reasonably tricky one for objects, as different people could
    be involved in an object&#39;s design, manufacture, or even as its subject (eg in a
    photograph). Sometimes all of this data is recorded for museum objects, but I
    wanted simply to focus on what the object might say about the institution, and
    so the only &#39;Who&#39; I&#39;m interested in is the person who collected it. This could
    be a historic figure (Henry Wellcome), or a curator. In many cases, this data
    isn&#39;t recorded, but where it is, it could prove interesting.</p>
  <p>The second W, <b>&#39;What&#39;,</b> is perhaps the most important, but also the most potentially
    difficult to define. Typically, collections databases may devote paragraphs of
    content to describing &#39;what&#39; an object is. In order to show an aggregated view
    of what objects a museum has, however,  data needs to be easily processable.
    The model I&#39;ve adopted for the design of this prototype is to gather short
    key-words, or tags, that describe the object on a most basic level. These might
    be, for example, &#39;clock&#39;, &#39;flag&#39;, &#39;coin&#39;, and so on. Gathering these keywords
    may be a challenge, but I hope to be able to extract them in a crude manner
    from whatever categorisation data is available. If this fails, perhaps there&#39;s
    a social solution (see next section).</p>
  <p>The third W, <strong>&#39;Where&#39;</strong>, might refer to the place an object is
    from. I don&#39;t want to worry too much about which sense of belonging this might
    refer to. For our purpose it can simply be where an object was collected from,
    information that is often part of the data recorded by museums. As places are
    relatively abstract concepts, to use place as an axis for aggregation, we need
    to pick a level of granularity that yields a reasonably discrete list. &#39;City&#39;
    is a bad choice, as many objects aren&#39;t from cities, and so I&#39;ll take the easy
    option of only caring about places at the country level. Whilst country borders
    and identities aren&#39;t without dispute, they&#39;re stable enough, and there&#39;s a
    helpful list provided by the ISO, with standardised codes for each country.</p>
  <p>The fourth W, <strong>&#39;When&#39;</strong>, adds a temporal dimension. As museums
    typically keep objects for a long time, and have historic collections, this is
    a key one. Timelines are a fairly standard means of navigation on museum object
    Web sites, and for good reason. In my case, as I&#39;m interested in what a
    museum&#39;s collections might say about the museum, the &#39;when&#39; I&#39;m interested in
    is when the object was collected. Not only is this significant in telling the
    story of a museum&#39;s historic activities, but it also tends to be one of the
    things that routinely gets noted in a museum&#39;s records. This may be recorded as
    a full date, but for aggregation purposes I&#39;m only going to bother with dates
    at the level of year. </p>
  <p>The fifth W is <strong>&#39;Why&#39;</strong>. This is the trickiest, as the reason
    for collecting an object might never get recorded. Even if it is, as in the
    modern museulogical practice of adoption acquisition policies, it&#39;s hard to see
    a way of exposing this as a means for aggregating a museum&#39;s objects. So I&#39;m
    going to cop out and not bother with this one. To replace it (five is a nice
    number), we can borrow &#39;How&#39;, which is sometimes lumped in with the five Ws
    anyway. &#39;How&#39; in these circumstances can refer to &#39;how&#39; an object was
    collected. The exact means by which an object was acquired might be complex and
    unrecorded, but there are a few different options that we can generalise upon:
    objects can be acquired through purchase, donation, or loan (&#39;stolen&#39; might be
    a fourth option, but let&#39;s not go there). This is not perhaps the most
    interesting-sounding  meta-data, but it might give us some insights
    nevertheless.</p>
  <p>So, to recap, the axes I&#39;ve selected (and each gets its own
    URI; see table below) are Who (a person), What (some tags), Where (a country),
    When (a year) and How (purchase, donation or loan). Each of these concepts is
    fairly simple, and they are so widely used that there are standardised ways to represent them in machine-readable formats. People, tags
    and dates, for example, can all be represented by &#39;microformats&#39; (see <a href="http://microformats.org/">http://microformats.org/</a>).
    This is significant, as microformats aim to &#39;pave the cow paths&#39; of current
    behaviours and usage patterns, and represent simple bits of semantic information
    that can be embedded within normal HTML pages. So if our meta-data correlate
    with existing microformats, rather than complex Semantic Web-style ontologies,
    there&#39;s more chance that the data will be interoperable, and actually used.</p>

  <h1>Social Interactions</h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">I have so far identified the first-order
    objects and &#39;list views&#39; for a museum object Web site, but a final design step
    is to think about how this &#39;web of data&#39; might be socialised. We don&#39;t need to
    add a social dimension to data visualisation to be interesting, but it could
    help us in a number of ways. The first, most prosaically, would be the augmentation
    of our data, with users both filling in gaps and adding extra data. The second
    is as a way of allowing the most interesting observations to surface. The final
    reason is to simply keep the service alive - socialising around the web of data
    is something people naturally do, and it will often drive the use of the data,
    and even the data itself, in interesting and unpredicted ways.</p>
  <p>Rather than just guessing at what social
    elements might work for a &#39;web of data&#39; around a museum&#39;s object collection,
    blogger Jyri (Engeström, 2005) has defined a useful framework which in some
    ways builds upon the architectural principles proposed by Coates. Engeström
    suggests we start by defining what our &#39;social object&#39; is. This is important,
    he reasons, because the most engaging interactions happen around objects -
    photos, films, books, and son on. He contrasts these interactions with the
    initial social networks - Friendster being the main example - which were
    focused solely around people and their connections. Here, he says, there was
    nothing much to do other than to &#39;add friends&#39;. Once this activity (and calling
    it an activity is apt, as Jyri quotes another blogger who went so far as to say
    about Friendster that &#39;That was the &#34;game&#34; right? He who has
    the most contacts wins.&#39;) dried up, the sites stagnated. Myspace
    (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/">http://www.myspace.com</a>) might be an example here, but it has arguably come to
    find its social object in bands and musicians.</p>
  <p>Do museum objects make a good &#39;social objects&#39;.  Jyri has
    posted some thoughts on this too (Engeström, 2007). One key factor is something
    he describes as an object&#39;s &#34;social gravitational pull&#34; - in short,
    how much people care about it, and how many ‘handles’ there are to generate
    discussion and conversation points.</p>
  <p>If you look at most of the successful Web services that have
    built around the &#39;Web of Data&#39; model, the &#39;social object&#39; that the site is
    built around tends to fit one of two categories. Either it is an object that
    all users create, as in the photos on Flickr or the trips on Dopplr, or it is
    an object of culture that few people create, but lots of people are interested
    in, as in the books on Amazon or the films on IMDB/ or Netflix. The former
    group of objects have inherently high social pull, as the people who create
    them have a natural emotional attachment. The second group of objects are less
    inherently social, but instead are elevated to a level of social engagement
    through their position in popular culture. Museum objects don&#39;t really fall in
    either camp. They aren&#39;t created by the users, nor do they fall into easily
    accessible culture.</p>
  <p>Museums typically hold some objects which do have high
    emotional and social appeal, however. These are usually either icons from
    history (such as the Science Museum&#39;s Stevenson&#39;s Rocket), or items with a high
    recognition factor, evoking personal memories and nostalgia (old televisions,
    washing machines and toys). Across the collection as a whole, though, these
    objects can be few and far between. An anecdote often quoted at the Science
    Museum is that we have, somewhere, a collection of several thousand scalpels,
    each subtly different from the next, but largely similar. Whilst this
    collection as a whole is interesting, the individual items can often have low
    social pull.</p>
  <p>This creates a problem for any Web site trying to add value
    to a web of museum object data through social networking and user interaction.
    A better museum candidate for something to build a social Web service around is
    exhibitions. These are less granular, and have social &#39;pull&#39; from the fact that
    people physically visit them, sometimes even paying for a ticket. A social Web
    site based around museum exhibitions would be an interesting project to pursue,
    although it would have to cover all museums in order to have enough data to be
    interesting.</p>
  <p>For this project, though, the focus is firmly on museum
    objects. A way to get around the problem of the millions of individual objects
    having low social pull is to de-emphasise  the importance of the individual
    object pages, which will have very little data anyway, and play up the
    importance of the aggregation pages. If an individual scalpel isn&#39;t
    interesting, then perhaps the collection of scalpels will be. This is somewhat
    equivalent to the &#39;groups&#39; feature in Flickr, where a &#39;pool&#39;
    of photos can be collected, with discussion and members attached to the
    collective group of photos.</p>
  <h1>Aggregation pages, or &#39;List Views&#39;</h1>
  <p>Designing a Web service around aggregation
    pages is hard. Not only do I need the pages for each Who, What, Where, When and
    How, but I also need pages where these can be combined, so that it&#39;s possible
    to point people at a pages of &#39;objects from the Science Museum collected
    in 1962 from India&#39;, or &#39;objects from the National Maritime Museum that are
    coins and were acquired by a purchase&#39;. There are, of course, millions of
    permutations. These views could simply be accessible through an advanced
    search, of the type where you select two fields, their values and an &#39;AND&#39;
    operator to specify the intersection of these fields. This is a possible, and perhaps
    even useful feature, but it would be hard to make it easily usable. It&#39;s
    well-known that &#39;advanced search&#39; options rarely get used on public Web sites,
    and anyway, this feature would suffer from the problem that, before searching,
    a user would have no way of knowing how many results would be in the returned
    collection.</p>
  <p>A better approach might be to use some kind of sophisticated
    computing algorithm which identifies properties of objects that seem to follow
    a pattern, and suggests collections which are possibly interesting. Flickr has
    experimented with this kind of approach with their &#39;clusters&#39;
    feature, where the image tags are analysed for tags that often appear together;
    they are then presented as a group comprising the photos which are tagged by most
    of the tags within that cluster. This relatively simple concept can generate
    some genuinely meaningful groupings. The clusters for the tag &#39;museum&#39; are, at
    present &#39;art,  architecture,  sculpture&#39;, &#39;newyork,  nyc,  newyorkcity&#39;,
    &#39;paris,  france,  louvre&#39; and &#39;london,  england,  uk&#39; - which together do seem
    represent some of the most popular locations and types of museum.</p>
  <p>Finally, we can look to social actions to
    help pick out some of the most interesting aggregation pages. There&#39;s a good
    history of this approach. At the simplest level, you can simply watch what
    people are talking and blogging about elsewhere. Google Earth, for example, is
    an enormous resource for aerial photography, but much of the world is just
    boring ocean, dessert, or endless suburban sprawl. Nevertheless, there are
    plenty of fascinating things in there if you know where to look, and helpful
    bloggers have documented many of them. A feature on The Register, for example,
    asked people to send in sightings of &#39;black helicopters&#39;, or other secret
    military equipment (see Haines 2005). The result was staggering - not only were
    there many spottings of black helicopters, but also spottings of crop circles,
    fighter planes, nuclear submarines and more. For other examples, we can look at
    the work of Stamen Design (<a href="http://stamen.com/">http://stamen.com/</a>), an agency famed for data
    visualisations. One of their projects, Trulia Hindsight
    (<a href="http://hindsight.trulia.com/">http://hindsight.trulia.com/</a>) plots house building data on an interactive map,
    showing how cities and towns were formed over time. Again, much of it looks the
    same, but users are able to point to interesting places, such as where planned
    towns were rapidly constructed, or where an area had to rebuild homes lost to a
    fire, and these places are then exposed to users as good starting
    points. This kind of model could work for a collection of museum objects.</p>
  <p>Having established what our social objects are, and how
    social activity will be focused around the aggregation pages, it&#39;s worth
    thinking briefly about what these social interactions might be. Engeström
    suggests that a key principle is to &#39;define your verbs&#39;. These are often to
    &#39;add&#39; something (a photo, a comment, a tag), or might be to share, to save, to
    recommend... For a Web site about museum objects, the kinds of things we might
    want our users to do might be &#39;to bookmark&#39; a collection, either within the site or on an external service like del.icio.us, &#39;to comment&#39;
    on some objects, and perhaps &#39;to correct&#39; information, if they believe it to be
    wrong.</p>
  <h1>Implementation</h1>
  <p>Now that I&#39;ve outlined the framework for
    how museum object data might be presented in a Web site, I&#39;ll return to the
    practicalities of producing a prototype for demonstration. At the time of
    writing, I&#39;ve received object data resulting from the Freedom of
    Information requests from four museums. The data arrived in different formats,
    with different types of meta-data, requiring some work to compile these sources
    together.</p>
  <p>One list of objects came as a folder full of Word documents,
    each containing a table with the object data - not the easiest format to import
    into a database, but a bit of copying and pasting into a spreadsheet, then
    exporting as a comma-separated-values file, made it more or less machine
    readable. Another practical problem came from a museum which sent me their object
    data as a huge, 1GB+ xml file. I couldn&#39;t even open the file without my machine
    crashing, and so the solution was to run a command to split the file into a few
    hundred smaller files that were easier to work with. One reason to outline
    these issues is to make the point that it doesn&#39;t matter too much which format
    a museum makes their data available in. Some formats are easier to use than
    others, but the determined developer can usually find a way, and so there&#39;s
    little excuse in practical terms for not making this data available.</p>
  <p>The second challenge I&#39;ve faced in pulling together data for
    a prototype is not having data available in a structured format. One data set,
    for example, had a &#39;location&#39; listed for a good proportion of the objects, but
    these locations were listed in a free text field rather than containing a
    reference to country or town. Even at a country level, countries were referred
    to in different ways (&#39;Republic of France&#39; vs &#39;France&#39;, etc). Going through
    every record and picking out which country the location referred to would have
    been a huge job, so the solution here is to take a pragmatic approach. Rather
    than going through every record, we can just generate a list of all the unique
    location strings, order them by how frequently they occur, and then start at
    the top. In this way, within an hour or so I was able to convert most of the
    locations into structured references to a country. Locations which only
    occurred once or twice were discarded. This means having slightly less data,
    but it&#39;s a worthwhile compromise that quickly gives some useful data to start
    with.</p>
  <p>For construction of the prototype Web site, I&#39;ve used the
    Web framework language Ruby on Rails, which allows data-driven Web sites to be
    quickly built and rapidly iterated. To generate graphs and charts which help to
    visualise the data, I&#39;ve used the Google Charts API, which lets you simply pass
    variables to Google and receive back an image file containing your chart. To
    illustrate where objects come from in the world, I&#39;ve
    developed a custom Flash animation which takes a dynamically-created XML file
    and colours in the countries of the world accordingly. None of these is
    particularly complex, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot more that could be done in the
    way of clever visualisations, but I think this a good enough start to
    illustrate the ideas that this paper introduces.</p>
  <h1>Initial Observations</h1>
  <p>Having constructed this framework and begun
    to import museum object data into it, I am already able to make some initial
    observations. First, holes in the information available are fairly
    apparent. Whilst there is data available for hundreds of thousands of objects
    from one museum, the proportion of these that have both an acquired year and a
    country of origin is fairly small, making it harder to visualise where and when
    the objects entered the collections. These data holes are unfortunate, and
    emphasise the importance of a well-kept set of object records.</p>
  <p>Despite the holes, though, there&#39;s already enough data to
    allow making some useful and interesting assessments. A simple graph showing
    how many objects were acquired each year for different museums is instantly
    quite appealing, and the trends are easy to spot. Likewise, a map showing where
    in the world a museum’s objects have been acquired from is also interesting -
    and for one museum, shows a clear bias towards coastal countries.</p>
  <p>One interesting, and perhaps obvious, flaw
    to point out, though, is that these visualisations treat all objects as equal.
    That is, for the purposes of the map visualisation, a count is simply kept of
    how many objects have been acquired from each country.
    Countries with a higher count are shaded in a darker colour. This gives a
    reasonable account of the proportion of the collection that comes from
    different countries, but can easily be skewed. Two hundred small coins end up
    counting for far more than a single large train. In some ways, this is fine, as
    the collection of coins is in some ways bigger than the single train. However,
    it may be interesting to explore ways of weighting collections based on other
    factors, such as physical size, or perhaps even some measure of &#39;importance&#39;
    (how this could be measured, I leave as an exercise to the reader). Physical
    dimensions are often stored in object records, but parsing this data into a machine-readable
    format would require a fair amount of work.</p>
  <p>Finally, it&#39;s worth making the point that
    the objects in this prototype are all described in text form only. It&#39;s
    typically thought fairly critical to include photos of objects when
    representing them on-line, and taking these photos can consume a huge amount of time, effort and money. Because this paper examines an approach for
    representing a huge volume of objects - a &#39;quantitative approach&#39;- though, and
    focuses on the aggregation pages, the absence of images has less of an impact.
    If images were to be added, it perhaps would be less useful to have photos of
    the individual objects; instead, photos could be added to loosely represent the
    collections of objects - types of objects, objects from a particular country,
    etc. If this were the case, there would be less need to make sure that images
    were paired up precisely with the objects photographed in them, and so you
    could allows users to contribute photos - such as those taken in the museum.</p>
  <h1>Conclusions</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this paper is not to describe a finished
    piece of work; rather, to explore a direction in which museum object data could
    travel. The core of this idea is to open up the data that museums hold about
    their objects, and to expose the data in interesting ways that can be used to
    make observations about a museum&#39;s history. The work of creating the
    visualisations and overviews doesn&#39;t even have to be done by the museum itself
    - if the data is made public (or indeed, officially requested), interested
    third parties can interpret the data themselves. This spirit of openness allows
    museum objects to form part of the &#39;web of data&#39; that is now emerging, and
    holds great potential to engage the public in the debate about the history and
    future of museum collections. </p>
  <p>Whilst the most famous Web services have so far been driven
    by user-created content, there is a growing trend to place public information
    in the &#39;Web of data&#39;. Examples from the UK include the excellent work of
    MySociety (<a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">http://www.mysociety.org/</a>),
    which has moved political information such as the voting records of MPs and the
    debates from parliament into an open Web environment. There is no reason why
    museum data cannot exist here too.</p>
  <p>Looking forward, once it is possible to compare collections
    from different museums, there is also the scope to look at private collections
    - of which the principal source may be eBay, where millions of collectable
    objects are acquired every week (indeed, sometimes by museums).</p>
  <p>I&#39;d like to conclude by pointing readers towards the on-line
    manifestation of the research that this paper is based on. It can be found at <a href="http://www.museum-collections.org/">http://www.museum-collections.org/</a> (from April 2008). The prototype is, of course, in perpetual &#39;beta&#39;, and your
    feedback is very welcome.</p>
