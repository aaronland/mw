    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>An often-repeated finding in human-computer interaction (HCI)
        research is that user experience is tightly coupled to understanding of
        underlying technology. In systems where function is largely dematerialized and
        processes are obscured, an audience for new technology often reverts to
        interpreting their experience through familiar models of system behavior. This
        applies equally in many new media art pieces as it does in human-computer
      interaction. </p>
      <p>What distinguishes new media art pieces from other forms
        of HCI is their reliance in part on a self-conscious use of technological
        tropes as a prompt for novel user experience. HCI has its roots in human
        factors engineering with its focus on measurement and optimization of
        performance of routine tasks. Consequently, the goal of many HCI design cases,
        even in novel pervasive and ubiquitous computing environments, is an interface
        or tool that melts away to provide seamless interaction with services. To a
        much greater extent, media art is experienced through a seamful interface, or
        one that exposes the physical nature of the underlying technology, and
        addresses directly the uncertainty in sensing technology and the
        transformations made to data as it migrates across network infrastructures (Chalmers
        and Galani 2004; Chalmers, Bell et al. 2005). These kinds of interfaces promote
        moments of reflection and lead to compelling user experiences that are
      difficult to study using traditional HCI methods. </p>
      <p>Increasingly, when confronted with these systems, HCI
        researchers turn to ethnographic methods for understanding user experience.
        Ethnographic methods are those traditionally applied to the study of human
        social processes, but have been applied successfully to human interaction with
        technology and socio-technical systems (Suchman, Blomberg et al. 1999).
        Defining the category broadly, HCI methods that touch on ethnography include
        Urban and Cultural Probes, Bodystorming, and physical Wizard-of-Oz prototyping.
        Urban and Cultural Probes (Gaver, Dunne et al. 1999; Gaver, Boucher et al.
        2004; Mattelmaki 2005; Paulos and Jenkins 2005; Graham, Rouncefield et al.
        2007; Lucero, Lashina et al. 2007) are methods employed early in the design
        process to allow researchers to gather relevant data on social practices
        surrounding technology in public spaces. An urban probe is often composed of
        low-tech interventions meant to interact with the normal flow of a disengaged
        public audience; for example, stalking the flow of traffic around a trashcan in
        a plaza in San Francisco with video to inform the design of an augmented
        trashcan (Paulos and Jenkins 2005), or scattering matchbooks around Portland,
        Oregon with a URL for those who pick it up to visit and give their opinion of
        the city (Paulos and Beckmann 2006). The data collected by these methods
        suggest the spatial distribution of various kinds of behavior present in a
        population, and can help designers make more informed decisions about how to
      develop and deploy new technology.</p>
      <p>Similarly, a cultural probe can consist of a set of
        prompts and technology, distributed among members of the community of interest,
        meant to collect a better impression of local culture. With Situationist
        dérives as an influence, cultural probes are often rooted in attempts to
        capture sensory or affective memories; for example, a packet of postcards,
        maps, and a disposable camera each with a request to gather a bit of data -
        e.g. take a photo of the first person you see today (Gaver, Dunne et al. 1999).
        Bodystorming (Bell, Chalmers et al. 2006; Jacucci, Oulasvirta et al. 2007) is a
        way of exploring the affordances and constraints of a physical space by
        actually being in the place where the design is intended for use. Perhaps this
        is not a radical shift for many designers, but it is a significant step out of
        the laboratory for HCI researchers. In a related technique, physical
        Wizard-of-Oz prototyping, system functionality is only simulated through
        mockups or by acting out the functionality of the entire embodied user
        experience, the buttons pressed, the commands given to the system - all in hopes
        of saving time in technology development and exposing the interaction model to
      closer scrutiny.</p>
      <p>These methods have been used in studies of both functional
        and artistic application of novel technology (Iversen and Nielsen 2003; Hulkko,
        Mattelmaki et al. 2004; Paulos and Beckmann 2006; Boehner, Vertesi et al. 2007;
        DiSalvo and Vertesi 2007), and suggest moments that are important, seamful
      points of interaction that inform user experience. </p>
      <p>New media art has matured to the point of establishing a
        canon (e.g. Leopoldseder, Schopf et al. 2004), and explores novel methods of
        embodiment and engagement (Munster 2006) of enough interest to museums to
        warrant a number of preservation and archival programs. For example, the
        Variable Media Initiative (VMI) tries to account for the mutability of media
        with an approach called “permanence through change”, and the V2 Institute for
        Unstable Media (V2) has a model that tries to document every aspect of the
      design process of a piece so as to allow for a smooth recreation. </p>
      <p>These approaches work well for many pieces of new media
        art – however it happens to be defined - and there are several successful
        case studies of the VMI and V2 frameworks applied to new media pieces with
        various underlying technologies and modes of presentation: video art, interactive
        screen-based art, installations. However, all of these efforts focus on a
        preservation of the system state and documentation, and not as strongly on
        preserving the interaction model that an audience builds with the piece.
        Storing an instance of the work may not include describing an audience
        behaviors piece for recreation or reinterpretation. And though the system can
        be faithfully reconstructed, aspects of the piece, including intentional
        ambiguities or unintentional flaws that led to a particular interpretation or
      use, could be overlooked. </p>
      <p>In this paper we examine three instances of New Media /
        HCI collaboration that can only be realized with the active participation of
        their audience. Rafael Lozano-Hemmer&#39;s <i>Vectorial Elevations</i> is a site-based piece of &#34;relational
        architecture&#34; that has to be controlled by the audience to be complete.
        George Legrady&#39;s <i>Pockets Full of Memories</i> creates an on-line database from digital scans of physical objects
        offered by participants in the gallery and on-line. Blast Theory&#39;s <i>Can
          You See Me Now?</i> transforms a city into a
        game board where runners chase virtual audience members through the streets. We
        show how, even when used together, the VMI questionnaire and the V2 interaction
        model can still miss important aspects of audience participation, aspects which
        may be available to those interested in preservation of these works through
        ethnographic methods. More than highlighting seamful system features,
        ethnographic methods can yield a better understanding of how people interact with
        media art and what elements of the system may contribute to their decisions. In
        such a way, an ethnographic analysis can also expose the elements of a novel
        technological experience that would need to be carefully considered for
      preservation</p>
      <h1>Direct Control – <i>Vectorial Elevations</i></h1>
      <p>Site-based methods (Kwon 2002) have come into new media
        art from, among others, conceptual and land-based art practices of the 1960’s
        and 70’s. New media often add telematic elements where cameras, monitors,
        sensors, and actuators allow for disembodied experience and immediate control
        of technology in remote locations (Manovich 2001), bringing the experience more
      in line with HCI.</p>
      <p><i>Vectorial Elevations</i> by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer consists of a set of high-powered searchlights deployed
        around the rooftops of public squares and a Web site for the remote control of
        the searchlights. The Web site available through terminals available on site
        and through the Internet includes a 3D model of the site where users can
        compose patterns of searchlight beams. The designs submitted by local and
        remote participants are cued, the searchlights are brought into place, and the
        pattern is documented through webcams. The documentation is then placed on a
        Web site, and participants are e-mailed a code where they can see their light
      pattern in space. </p>
      <p>The choice of venue for instances of <i>Vectorial
        Elevations</i> is culturally charged, with
        searchlights surrounding iconic buildings imbued with deep institutional
        histories. But as we elaborate later on, the site specificity of the pieces is
        not as important to Lozano-Hemmer as the “relational specificity” that is
        created in the site; however, he acknowledges the power of these references on
      the spectators. </p>
      <p>Lozano-Hemmer has constructed an environment where the
        interaction with the searchlights is constrained physically by the site, but
        more importantly, undetermined in terms of the behaviours that are allowed by
        the users or the interpretations of the patterns of light. Spectators are
        unaware of the person contributing a pattern or the meanings they are ascribing
        to their choices. <i>Vectorial Elevations</i> functions as a mediated conversation in a public space, inscribed on and around
      the buildings. </p>
      <h1>Content Providers – <b><i>Pockets Full of Memories</i></b> </h1>
      <p>In new media pieces the classical archive is often
        translated into a database with the attendant practices of curation,
        permutation, and information mining controlled either by the artist or, increasingly,
        by the audience. George Legrady keeps this potentially dematerialized practice
        of collection grounded in physical cases with <i>Pockets Full of Memories</i>. Museum patrons scan images of small objects that
        they have with them at the exhibition. These objects are then tagged and ranked
        along a number of dimensions by the patron. The scanned images, along with
        their collected metadata, are then placed into a projected visualization
        according to a self-organizing map algorithm creating an ever-changing
      arrangement of the collection from the participants. </p>
      <p>Legrady’s piece is a commentary on database culture, the
        elevation of the everyday to something worth preserving, and the impulse that
        tries to make informative connections among everyday minutiae. The audience
        here is implicated into the data processing substrata, choosing to contribute
        their small (perhaps precious, meaningful) objects willingly into a system that
      can only hope to partially represent the artifacts that make up the collection. </p>
      <p>An interaction with Legrady’s archive is a social act
        – one that acknowledges the past use of the piece by other audience
        members and also the connections made between a personal contribution and the
        network of material referents no longer present in the space. This immediately
        connects the easily manipulated and transitory digital representations with the
        material world. It also makes the interaction with the piece part of an ongoing
      dialogue, one that needs to be accounted for in any preservation effort. </p>
      <h1>Engagement – <b><i>Can You See Me Now?</i></b> </h1>
      <p>With the increase in computing technology moving off the
        desktop into ubiquitous and pervasive applications, artists have begun using
        these systems to examine issues of surveillance/sousveillance, the invisibility
        of labor in high tech scenarios, and the reconfiguring of public space into
        “smart” spaces. Similar spatial interventions are common in the Public Art
        practices of the 1970s and 80s (Lacy 1995), but extend the possibilities and
        allow for a deeper sense of engagement and obscure the hand of the artist to an
      even greater degree. </p>
      <p>Blast Theory and their collaborators at the Mixed Reality
        Lab at the University of Nottingham have deployed several such systems. For <i>Can
          You See Me Now?</i> on-line participants (at
        the museum/gallery or via the Web) navigate a rendered model of the game area
        – a region of the physical city instrumented with Wi-Fi coverage. A group
        of people, “runners”, are then deployed into the city with the task of chasing
        down the virtual participant, visible to them through wireless handheld
        computers augmented with GPS coverage. It’s a game of tag really, but one that
        merges the physical site with the virtual in compelling ways. The players have
        an audio connection in addition to text chat, transmitting a live stream of
        heavy breathing and coordination commands to the various audiences of the
        piece. Runners are immediately implicated with forces of power and control in
        the site, but their knowledge of the space is sometimes incomplete with GPS and
      Wi-Fi failures. </p>
      <p>None of these elements is preset in the system:  this
        allows for dynamic game instances and a live platform for computing research.
        And while the piece requires involved participation from several publics and
        would not exist without their meaningful engagement, the designers of the game
        have made very little effort to define styles of audience participation. As we
        discuss below, perhaps counter-intuitively this lack of specificity in the
        games rules leads to a good understanding of the interaction model between the
      various individuals and system components. </p>
      <h1>Approaches to New Media Preservation </h1>
      <p>The preservation of new media art complicates existing
        museum accession and conservation practices. The multiplicity of formats and
        modes of display open to artists has added work and introduced new layers of
        nuance to an already qualitative and subjective practice (Irvin 2006). With the
        growing recognition of how preserving new media art can relate to artist’s
        intent (Odegaard 1995; Dykstra 1996), audience engagement and participation (Marontate
        2005; Martinon 2006), and naturally the media involved (Laurenson 2001; Real
        2001; Laurenson 2006), preservation efforts have tried to provide guidelines
      and frameworks to ease the process.</p>
      <p>The Electronic Arts Intermix has a rather comprehensive
        approach to preservation of digital art. Starting with documentation,
        inspection, and assessment of the state of the various digital components,
        through data storage best practices, and strategies of migration, emulation,
        and encapsulation, EAI’s approach handles the entire life of a piece. The New
        Art Trust, along with The Museum of Modern Art, New York, the San Francisco
        Museum of Modern Art, and the Tate Gallery in London, has developed an
        initiative called Media Matters (NAT) which analyzes the requirements of
        Time-based media works of art, especially their curation, exchange, and
        display. As with many other new media preservation tools, there are several
        questionnaires and reports for the loaning institution and exhibiting venue to
      assess the needs of accurately displaying and preserving the artwork. </p>
      <p>Another such questionnaire is part of the Variable Media
        Initiative. The stated aim of the questionnaire is to provide the kernel of
        information for new media preservation efforts on a case-by-case basis, and to
        provide structured data in such a way that the information can be shared by
        other museums and galleries and compared across works and genres. The
        questionnaire divides the process of preservation into a description of the
        original version of the work and how a work is to be presented in later recreations.
        Four strategies are available for future versions of the work: storage,
        emulation, migration, and reinterpretation. Reinterpretation is a useful
        extension that frees the preserving institution from many of the thorny debates
        around emulation and migration, and gets more at the core themes of a work
      rather than any particular choices of presentation. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, as with other qualitative surveys, the data
        collected is highly contextualized:  the same answer to a given question across
        surveys is not comparable without a deeper understanding of the particulars of
        a piece and the artist. The authors of the questionnaire admit that there are
        questions and debates that cannot be anticipated in the questionnaire format,
        but still hope to derive firm guidelines for future exhibitions – a
        potentially problematic perspective when the questionnaire is both a formal
      data collection tool and an “ethical will” to guide preservation efforts.</p>
      <p>V2 has explored a more formal documentation model called
        Capturing Unstable Media. The formal component is the Capturing Unstable Media
        Conceptual Model or CMCM. It provides an ontology for documenting the various
        objects and actors that go into the creation and execution of instances of new
        media art. An important extension is a robust interaction model – for
        interaction between the work and stakeholders – that is lacking from most
        of the other preservation efforts. Unfortunately, this is the least developed
      portion of the documentation scheme. </p>
      <p>The model for interaction in the V2 framework is a
        message-passing metaphor between a set of actors. This relationship is further
        categorized by its interaction synchronicity, interaction location, user
        number, interaction level, and sensory mode. The most interesting for purposes
        of comparison to HCI’s ethnographic methods is the interaction level element.
        Potential values for this field are Observational, Navigational, Participatory,
        Co-authoring, and Intercommunication. Though broad, using these categories can
        be a useful first step in considering models of audience participation in new
        media. The authors do point out that in the V2 framework “the description of
        interaction with an occurrence should refer to the minimal interaction that is
        needed for the occurrence to function as its creator has intended” (V2).
        However, the more complex elements of interaction are left for qualitative
      description and developed through “well chosen documentation.” </p>
      <p>The V2 framework is informative, but again, exists as an
        archive of practice, not purely as a set of guidelines for preservation,
        archiving, or reinterpretation of the work. The scope is understandably narrow,
        with a focus on a very complete and detailed description of the resources and
        relationships between entities in the construction and execution of the piece,
        but perhaps too little guidance for describing the experiences of an audience
        with a piece. For example, emulation, conversion, and migration are discussed
        in the context of preserving the documentation archive, but not as strategies
        that may be applied to the work as a whole. Again, this is not meant to be an
        attack on the V2 framework - simply recognition that the goals of the project
        may not align with preservation of new media pieces that rely on a high degree
      of audience participation. </p>
      <p>A full analysis of these new media preservation frameworks
        is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, the V2 and VMI approaches are
        examined more closely through partial applications to the example pieces
        outlined above. Rather than being case studies, the examples here are meant to
        highlight elements of audience participation that the methods would miss when
        applied to similar new media projects. To ground this discussion further, we
        explore what features might be outside the purview of the existing frameworks
        that artists might suggest as key when understanding participatory new media.
        Would an experience be the same if reinterpreted by a new technology? Is it the
        social experience that is really at stake? Are there less tangible elements in
        the microculture of participation constructed by the artists that escape
        existing preservation models? And how might ethnographic techniques further
      inform preservation efforts?</p>
      <h1>Questionnaires and <b><i>Vectorial Elevations</i></b> </h1>
      <p>New Media preservation questionnaires face a number of
        problems when dealing with complex socio-technical systems like <i>Vectorial
          Elevations</i>. The first instance of <i>Vectorial
            Elevations</i> though firmly sited in Mexico
      City’s Zócalo could exist just as well in any large, public urban space. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">I am interested
        in distancing my practice from the notion of the ‘site-specific’, particularly
        from the postmodern attempts to find and deconstruct essential constituent
        characteristics of a particular space: I am very committed to the idea that a
        site consists of an indeterminate number of intersecting imaginary,
      socio-political, physical and tele-present spaces.” (Lozano-Hemmer 2000) </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">[Lozano-Hemmer
        goes on to say,] What is specific is the new behaviours that might emerge
        during interaction… [and] I wanted the main protagonist of the piece to be the
      participants themselves. </p>
      <p>Taken together, these statements suggest that preservation
        of this piece may need to focus on the particular performative actions taken by
        the audience, more than on the physical characteristics of the site. The VMI
        questionnaire does not address these issues. The closest question is in the
        Interactive section, “Viewer interacts with…” Possible options include the
        work, other viewers, performer/s, a combination of the above (explain), and not applicable. The response that comes closest is “combination of
      the above” which still requires further elaboration. </p>
      <p>V2’s interaction model would not fare much better. Someone
        modeling the interaction might hope that since the piece at least relates to
        specific sites and histories, the relationships could be structured formally.
      Lozano-Hemmer complicates this approach.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">The grounding
        is not the history or symbolism of the site, but the participation of the
        public. Without the public the piece cannot unfold, it cannot exist: it would
        be like a play without actors. For me, a piece is successful if the behaviours
        and relationships that arise from participation manage to surprise the
        artist/designer...in other words, the outcomes should not have been pre-programmed.
        Instead, the piece should establish some initial conditions, a platform or
        vehicle where people can do whatever it is they&#39;re going to do through the
      constraints and affordances of the piece itself. (Lozada 2003)</p>
      <p> In this way the interaction model of a given instance of <i>Vectorial
        Elevations</i> might change from one instance
      to the next.</p>
      <p>Though the piece itself can exist outside of a particular
        physical context, a coup for potential archival and preservation efforts, the
      artist does rely on cues from the site to make interface level decisions. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">For me
        dependency on participation is a way to ‘ground’ an installation and this helps
        me conceive interfaces and strategies that demystify the spectacular. The key
        is to develop pieces that offer some degree of intimacy within an intimidating
        scale. Also to find participation metaphors that are relatively familiar or
        self-explaining. Finally to offer a wide range of entry points into the work, attempting
        to underline the incompleteness, uselessness and indeterminacy of the
        initiative. (Stocker and
      Schopf 2001) </p>
      <p>Particularly pernicious is the passage on “participation
        metaphors”. What exactly are “relatively familiar or self-explaining” metaphors
      for an audience unfamiliar with interaction with contemporaneous technology? </p>
      <p>Some technical guidelines are provided in the text of
        several interviews. “The main design specification was that the interface
          should be accessible across platforms, across browsers and without the need for
          any plug-ins” (Lozano-Hemmer, 2000). These technical details are
        interesting inasmuch as they further expose the focus of the work being so much
        on participation and not on specific forms of technology – another
        helpful point for preservation efforts. For example, the VMI Storage and
          Emulation strategies are not appropriate
        for this work. Based on interviews and the patterns of subsequent deployments
        of <i>Vectorial Elevations</i>, Migration and Reinterpretation are more in line with Lozano-Hemmer’s practice: “While I am a great fan of
        [Wodiczko’s and Haacke’s] work, I am more interested in temporary, minor
        histories that can be established with relationships between the site and the
        public” (Adriaansens and Brouwer 2002). And of the two, the Reinterpretation
        form of the questionnaire asks the more appropriate questions for the
        installed, interactive, and networked options. For example, “Adjust dimensions
        according to artist&#39;s instructions on site-specificity?” and “Should future
        visitors manipulate the work in a way previous participants couldn&#39;t but which
        is consistent with the spirit of the work?” get closer to the issues of future
        display that appear in the artist’s interviews. A mix of cultural and urban
        probes, perhaps studying the acceptance of augmented technology in a particular
        urban environment, could fill in some of the gaps in the questionnaire
      approach, giving insight as to how a new audience might manipulate a piece.</p>
      <h1>Media and <b><i>Pockets Full of Memories</i></b> </h1>
      <p>In some ways the preservation of <i>Pockets Full of
        Memories</i> should relate closely to that of
        time-based media (Laurenson 2006) or technology-based installations (Real
        2001; INCCA 2004-2007). The piece is deeply concerned with archiving, and in
        significant ways it is already self-documenting. But the material it collects
        and the physical construction of the installation are only part of the work.
      Important to Legrady are </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">[b]asically the
        conventions of how we classify information, the information itself, and the
        play of their relationship. In this artwork, the public provides the
        information, so what we end up with is an overall picture of the community of
        who came to the exhibition. It&#39;s a kind of data sampling of a particular group
        of museum visitors. (Legrady
      1998) </p>
      <p>The complicating element here is the focus on the
        particular audience for the piece. The interactions with the piece are
        determined in part by the conventions of information classification with which
        they are familiar. If these change, so does the model of interaction. And even
        if an accurate model is captured, it is still unclear how useful this might be
      when applied to future exhibitions. To continue, </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">One has to
        recognize that within the framework of the digital information communication
        environment, an interactive artwork’s intrinsic value as art experience lies in
        a synthesis of two components: the first consists of the content and
        information flow of the work, all aspects of which are normally determined by
        the artist, and the second consists of the conditions of its delivery,
        exhibition and reception, aspects of which are beyond the control of the works
      author. (Legrady 1998) </p>
      <p>If a new audience has different impressions of tagging or
        ranking, the interaction model that  accompanied the archived piece would no
        longer be informative. A deeper understanding of the contemporary role of
        information and organization would be required to make a new instance resonate
        in similar ways. This could be gained through iterative testing of a migrated
      interface or through a physical wizard-of-oz technique. </p>
      <p>In contrast to Lozano-Hemmer’s more open approach to
        technological choices, HCI-driven preservation decisions of Legrady’s work
        would likely be shaped by the belief in the interface, not the specific media
      or the database, as a catalyst to particular forms of audience participation. </p>
      My sense is
        that all information can be recontextualized and made to have meaning in one
        way or another. That&#39;s where interface design comes in, the design of the
        digital environment through pictures, layout, sounds, symbols, timing, and
      movement. All these things influence how the particular information will mean something (LeGrady in Speiker n.d.). 
      
      <p>This places the work firmly in the Emulation strategy for
        later recreations. The questions from the VMI Emulation form are much better
        suited in this case. For example, “Should the work be ‘reset’ to erase any
        trace of past participants, and new visitors allowed to leave their traces?” is
        immediately informative. Later recreations of the work have started with new
        databases, while a newer series has maintained the database of objects across
        instances. Well-crafted cultural probes directed at the museum audience could
        also give insight as to how the parts of an interface relate to their own
        archival practice. It is important to note that these probes should not be read
        as prototypes of the piece, or as focus group studies meant to measure
        reception. Instead their use should be bounded as information gathering
        techniques directing preservation decisions, especially when emulation is an available
      strategy.</p>
      <h1>Novelty and <b><i>Can You See Me Now?</i></b> </h1>
      <p>Some of the ethnographic HCI methods used to study novel
        features of <i>Can You See Me Now?</i> could be
      used to answer important preservation questions. For example, </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Our study
        reveals the diverse ways in which online players experienced the uncertainties
        inherent in GPS and WiFi, including being mostly unaware of them, but sometimes
        seeing them as problems, or treating them as a designed feature of the game,
      and even occasionally exploiting them within gameplay. (Benford, Crabtree et al. 2006) </p>
      <p>These strategies to handle the technical deficiencies in the
        system help expose elements of the piece that might not come across using the
      VMI questionnaire or might not be major points in a V2 interaction model. </p>
      <p>When the GPS failed, some users would retrace their steps,
        falling back on a familiarity with the technology and their surroundings.
        Clearly these elements have an impact on how the piece is received, through the
        impressions forming in the minds of the audience based on the behavior of other
        participants. But how is this to be captured using preservation methods?
        Extending the issue, there are of course technical questions of intentionally
        degrading the performance of future, and likely more accurate, systems, but
        also the more complex problems of handling user familiarity with a technology,
        and technology failure, and incorporating all of these points as a part of a
        successful experience. In fact, so much of the experience of the game is
        outside of the control of the designers – the experience of the game is
        even more contingent on the construction of an environment than in <i>Vectorial
          Elevations</i> or <i>Pockets Full of
            Memories</i> -  developing methods that would
        poll the audience and their social interactions seems integral to any
      preservation effort. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">We argue that
        designers should explicitly consider four potential states of being of a mobile
        participant: connected and tracked, connected but not tracked, tracked but not
        connected, and neither connected nor tracked. We then introduce five strategies
        that might be used to deal with uncertainty in these different states for
        different kinds of participant: remove it, hide it, manage it, reveal it, and
        exploit it. (Benford,
      Crabtree et al. 2006) </p>
      <p>Here technical decisions and limitations lead to a
        classification of at least four user experience states that would also need to
        be maintained. This kind of information could be simulated using migration, and
        given the evolution of some of the technology used in various instances of the
      game, the artists seem comfortable with this prospect. </p>
      <p>The central contribution of this example is to show how
        the ambiguity and under-determined aspects of the user experience can actually
        lead to clear guidelines about important elements that impact future experience
        with the piece. This uncertainty in design goals is even stronger when we
        consider how these very public pieces expose seams between the controlled and
      real life settings. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Due to their
        unusual appearance and actions, for example zig-zag running patterns and
        ritualized taking of photographs of empty spaces (the locations where they
        caught online players), performers attracted considerable attention from
        passers by. In Cologne, groups of children ran alongside the performers […] and
        in Tokyo some online players subsequently visited the physical game zone in
      order to run with the performers who have chased them. (Benford 2005) </p>
      <p> And given the appreciation of ambiguity by the game
        designers (Gaver, Dunne et al. 1999), and their other pieces like <i>Uncle Roy
          All Around You</i> (Benford, Crabtree et
        al. 2006), the technical choices that maintain a degree of indeterminacy are
        more than a system trait worthy of preservation: they are central to any model
      of participation. </p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>Considering the kinds of interaction required of
        participants to complete <i>Vectorial Elevations</i>, <i>Pockets Full of Memories</i>,
        and <i>Can You See Me Now?,</i> there
        appear to be real gaps in existing preservation models for new media. The gaps
        may not appear at the levels of documentation or accession in a museum context.
        Instead, the most easily missed elements are those that only come to light
        through use, those that describe the participatory context, and the more
        intangible elements. Consider the choices of venue for instances of <i>Vectorial
          Elevations</i>. The Zócalo in Mexico City and
        plazas in Lyon, France and Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain would all seem to suggest
        that a pattern of open public spaces would be required. A V2-style documentation
        would handle the individual cases well, reflecting the intricacies of dealing
        with such broad, open spaces, the arrangement of technology, and computer
        systems-level deployment diagrams. But it does not concern itself with why a
        particular site was chosen and what the expectations might be from an audience.
        A VMI-like questionnaire would let future re-interpreters of the piece know
        that it would be all right to adjust the dimensions or technology - but, as we
        have discussed, without the kind of directed explanation that has proven
      invaluable in similar HCI design cases.</p>
      <p> We may be judging the VMI questionnaire approach too
        harshly. Caitlin Jones from the curatorial staff at the Guggenheim and familiar
        with the development and deployment of the questionnaire, has said that
        &#34;it has proven to be not super successful as a data structure [...] but
        it&#39;s proved invaluable in terms of talking to artists.&#34; (Jones 2006) But
        even if the questionnaire succeeds and does engage the artists in a
        conversation with accession experts, it still leaves an ambiguous and
        misleading data structure in its wake – especially when it comes to
      pieces with requirements for audience participation. </p>
      <p>We should also acknowledge the different motivations for
        preservation in HCI and New Media. For HCI, ethnographic methods are often used
        to better describe or evaluate features of a technological experience that are
        ill-suited to more empirical approaches. This kind of evaluation, which in some
        cases brings with it an implied design determinism where an experience can be made
        measurably more poetic or more meaningful by simply tweaking the interface or
        changing the interaction model, may be incompatible with arts preservation.
        Outside of empirical aesthetics and the phenomenological connections between
        preservation and HCI, this way of valuing audience experience may not align
      with the values of artists, curators, or preservation experts.</p>
      <p>As qualitative methods, ethnographic techniques like those
        described here are flexible enough to fill the gaps in existing preservation frameworks.
        The work of planning, executing, and interpreting probes and similar approaches
        does not require specialized technical knowledge, and may be particularly
        useful when pieces have scant or conflicting preservation demands. The thread
        running through each of the examples is the embracing of the complex
        relationship a work has with an audience as something that can inform
        preservation efforts. True, the descriptions for these elements might be quite
        variable and the resulting preservation models may require significant
        interpretation - but without a significant effort to develop models of
        participation with new media pieces, we run the risk of creating well-meaning
        preservation plans that can obscure facets of the work by focusing too strongly
      on technological choices.</p>
