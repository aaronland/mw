        <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText">Most current efforts in social tagging by museums focus
    on how to improve public access to on-line collections. Indeed, tags do
    supplement existing documentation by providing an alternative vocabulary to describe
    works of art. But what can tags tell us about how images are perceived? Are the
    same images perceived differently by viewers from diverse cultures? Taking its
    cue from the steve project’s (<a href="http://www.steve.museum/">http://steve.museum</a>) research agenda, an ongoing
    study funded by the Rubin Museum of Art explores what tags reveal about the
    ways native communities respond to their own cultural iconography. Begun in
    March 2007, the study is collecting tags on Tibetan artworks from Tibetans and
    Westerners in Switzerland and New York on a customized steve installation
    (<a href="http://www.seeingtibetanart.org/">http://www.seeingtibetanart.org</a>). </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">Preliminary findings based on the Swiss data reveal: 1)
    different tagging and viewing patterns among Tibetans and Westerners; 2)
    complex and often awkward feelings young Tibetans experience when viewing
    traditional artworks; 3) clearly discernible levels of cultural pervasiveness
    of traditional images; and 4) shared misunderstandings about specific types of
    images. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">One of the first formal studies in the domain of social
    tagging, and perhaps the first to gather tags from a diaspora community, this
    project employs a mixed-methods approach that combines tags with ethnographic
    interviews and observations. It offers valuable insights for museums in three
    areas: 1) how Tibetan art is perceived by Tibetan and Western viewers; 2)
    analytical approaches that can help contextualize social tags; and 3) ideas and
    suggestions on designing tagging systems for native communities. </p>

    <h1>Museums and the Tibetan Community: A Reciprocal Relationship</h1>
      <p>To many Westerners, Tibetan art and culture is an
        impenetrable riddle. Traditional Buddhist images are encoded according to
        subtle spiritual principles that make them difficult to decipher. But what
        about Tibetans themselves? A common assumption is that Tibetans, or, for that
        matter, members of any native community, are knowledgeable about their own
        cultural imagery. This study set out to test that assumption through the
        collection and analysis of social tags on artworks from a cross-section of
        Tibetan Buddhist iconography. It examined not just knowledge, but also attitudes
      of young Tibetans about their cultural heritage.</p>
      <p>The context for this research is the growing need for
        cooperation between the Tibetan community and Western cultural institutions,
        many of which hold in their collections the last surviving treasures of a
        nation that has suffered 50 years of Chinese occupation. Currently, an
        estimated 140,000 Tibetans live in exile, and their numbers are steadily
        growing. The Tibetan exile populations in Switzerland and New York are the
        world’s largest after India. They number 3,000 (Pescia, 2004) and 4,000 (Alter
        &amp; Norbu, n.d.) respectively. For better or worse, life in exile has become a
        permanent condition, and Tibetan communities in the West face the challenges of
        maintaining their cultural traditions and transmitting them to the next
      generation.</p>
      <p>Tibetans increasingly perceive museums as ‘custodians’ of
        their endangered heritage. Unlikely to demand repatriation out of a sense of
        gratitude and respect, many view museums as sites of cultural transmission and
        even pilgrimage destinations. As ethnographer Leigh Miller Sangster (2007)
        relates, “[Tibetan] artists have joked […] about going for Buddhist pilgrimage
        to the West and doing prostrations in museums and galleries!” The complex
        intermingling of Western and Tibetan agendas evokes James Clifford’s “Museums
        as Contact Zones” (1997) in which he uses the term “reciprocity” to describe
      the new type of relationship between museums and native communities.</p>
      <h1>Seeing Tibetan Art Through Social Tags</h1>
      <p><i>Seeing Tibetan Art</i> was inspired by the steve project’s research agenda (Cataloguing by Crowd
        Working Group &amp; Trant, 2005) presented by Susan Chun at a seminar at the
        University of Lugano in 2005. One suggested research topic was how social tags
        might provide a window into the perceptions of viewers from different cultures.
        Chun  speculated that taggers could potentially describe images from their own
        cultures more successfully than others: “Are Italian taggers ‘better’ at
      tagging Italian art?”</p>
      <p>Plans to test this hypothesis with the Tibetan community in
        Switzerland grew out of a visitor study at the Ethnographic Museum in Zurich
        (see Mannion, 2007a, chap. 8; Mannion, 2007b). At an exhibition about the
        history of the Dalai Lama (<a href="http://www.diedalailamas.ch/">http://www.diedalailamas.ch</a>), interviews with 36
        Western and Tibetan visitors revealed decidedly different orientations between
        the two cultural groups. While Westerners used the exhibition as a means to
        expand intellectual knowledge or relive travel experiences, Tibetan families
        saw it as a venue for cultural transmission. In one case, a Tibetan mother
        accompanied her adult son through the galleries, augmenting the audio
        commentary with her own remarks. The family encountered numerous obstacles,
        among them the sophisticated intellectual content of the interpretive materials,
        which made the son feel awkward: “[Even for] me as a Tibetan it was not easy to
      understand...It’s like everything [is] new for me as well.”</p>

      <p class="caption">Figs 1a &amp; 1b: Tibetan participant and tagging platform
      installed on laptop</p>
      <p>Taking these remarks as a starting point, <i>Seeing Tibetan
        Art</i> was designed to investigate the
        relationship of young Tibetans to representations of their own heritage. The
        large Tibetan community in Switzerland provided an ideal testing ground. Once
        formulated as a proposal, the study was submitted to the Rubin Foundation
        (<a href="http://www.sdrubin.org/">http://www.sdrubin.org</a>) which funded it in December 2006. There were two core
        questions. What do social tags reveal about how Tibetan art is perceived?  How
        can this knowledge help improve physical and virtual exhibitions for Tibetan
      and Western audiences?</p>
      <h2>Mixed Methods Research Design</h2>
      <p>Because the tagging project grew out of an earlier
        ethnographic study, it seemed natural to incorporate qualitative methods into
        the predominately quantitative research design. Social scientist Julia Brannen
        (2005) and others argue persuasively for mixed methods research, pointing out
        that qualitative and quantitative techniques can be combined effectively to
        strengthen overall conclusions. The small scale of this project meant that
        qualitative methods could only be employed during a single phase of the
        research. Proctored tagging sessions conducted with Swiss Tibetan participants
        included ethnographic observation and interviews. Additional fieldwork at
        cultural events allowed me to become familiar with the cultural scene I was
        studying. The subsequent phases of the research followed a more traditional
        quantitative model, with tags and demographic data being collected remotely
      on-line. </p>
      <p>The final research design consisted of four phases (Table
        1). Phase 1 involved installation and customization of the open source
        steve.museum software. The user interface was restyled to reflect the look of
        the project. It was also translated into German. One version of this system is
        accessible on-line (<a href="http://www.seeingtibetanart.org/">http://www.seeingtibetanart.org</a>). A second version was
        installed on the laptop computer used to administer tagging sessions in the
        field. Phase 2 included collection of tags in Switzerland using a mixed methods
        approach.  Phase 3 involved the remote collection of tags from Tibetans and
        Westerners in New York using an essentially quantitative approach; as of this
      writing, Phase 3 is still underway. </p>

      <p class="caption">Table 1: Four-phase research design for Seeing Tibetan Art</p>
      <p>Insightful suggestions from Tibetan informants helped to
        shape and improve the research design. Kelsang, a young man deeply connected
        with community concerns through his membership in a local youth association, pointed
        out that traditional works hold little interest for many Tibetans of his
        generation: “It’s really contemporary art that’s most interesting for us.” His
        remarks led to the inclusion of a single contemporary work in the study, and
        yielded surprising results. Conversations with participants at proctored
        tagging sessions also revealed differences between first and second generation
        Swiss Tibetans and critical language issues that were otherwise invisible to
        the tagging system. These examples illustrate the value of an ethnographic
        orientation in native community and diaspora research. Even small amounts of
        qualitative data are extremely useful in clarifying research priorities,
        ensuring that they reflect community concerns as well as those of the museum (see
      Spradley, 1979; Sherman &amp; Strang, 2004). </p>
      <h2>Selected Artworks</h2>
      <p>Six images were tagged by study participants. The five
        traditional works come from the Rubin Museum of Art’s (<a href="http://www.rmanyc.org/">http://www.rmanyc.org</a>)
        collection. The single contemporary work is by Tenzing Rigdol, a Tibetan artist
        working in the United States. Table 2 includes the six artworks accompanied by
        a short description. The study’s primary focus was on the traditional works,
      which were chosen on the basis of the following criteria: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Representativeness</i>: the works represent a cross-section of Tibetan
        Buddhist iconography.</li>
      <li><i>Recognizability:</i> the subjects depicted have deep resonance within
        Tibetan Buddhist culture. </li>
      <li><i>Availability:</i> high quality digital reproductions of the works were
        already available on-line at Himalayan Art Resources
        (<a href="http://www.himalayanart.org/">http://www.himalayanart.org</a>). </li>
      <li><i>Good
        documentation:.</i> curators had written about
        the works, facilitating comparison between museum documentation and
        user-contributed tags. </li>
      <li><i>Legibility:</i> the digital reproductions were highly legible at the
        size displayed in the tagging interface. Legibility is an especially important
        issue for Tibetan art since many thangka paintings are extremely detailed.</li>

      <h2>The Tagging Platform</h2>
      <p>The platform used for data collection is a customized
        version of the steve.museum tagging system. Its functionality remained
        essentially unchanged apart from the fact that <i>Seeing Tibetan Art</i> users were expected to access the system once only.
        After visiting the project homepage (<a href="http://www.seeingtibetanart.org/">http://www.seeingtibetanart.org</a>),
        participants select their country and language option and arrive at the log in
        screen. They then complete a detailed demographic questionnaire (hosted by Survey
        Monkey, but seamlessly integrated into the interface) and proceed to tag the
        six images. Images are displayed in random order without titles or descriptions
      (Fig. 3b). </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="mannion.fig3a.large.jpg" alt="Figur e3a" width="400"/></p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 3a-3c: Project homepage, Main tagging screen (German
      version), Flickr community page</p>
      <p>Users are required to submit only one tag per image although
        instructions on the tagging screen encourage them to enter at least five tags.
        Artworks can be skipped, but eventually return in random rotation if they
        remain untagged. Following the session, users receive a thank-you email
        containing a link to a private Flickr set (Fig. 3c) with a photographic diary
        of the project and pictures of participants. The simple Flickr page fostered a
        feeling of connection among those involved. It also gave them a sense of
      transparency, because it enabled people to connect with me on a personal level.</p>
      <h2>Data Collection In Native Communities</h2>
      <p>In finding Tibetan participants, I faced the challenge of
        navigating a complex social network of people with little familiarity with
        Western-style studies. Conventional recruitment techniques such as printed flyers,
        e-mails, and newsgroup postings were useless. It was necessary to rely on
        informants who recruited participants from among their family, friends, and
        contacts. Different informants were connected with different segments of the
        population. Thupten, a community official and longtime Swiss resident,
        recruited exclusively second generation Swiss Tibetans, while Tashi, a teenager
        from Lucerne, recruited other first generation immigrants. Finding genuinely
        helpful informants can be difficult. Community organizations are an excellent
        resource, but members of these groups may recruit others with similar
        interests. This is a particularly sensitive issue in the Tibetan community
        where many organizations have political rather than more neutral social or
      cultural agendas.</p>
      <h2>Demographic Profile Of Participants</h2>
      <p>Since a primary aim of this study was to assess the
        knowledge of the younger generation of exiled Tibetans, all participants are
        between 15-45 years old. In any study of Tibetan Buddhist artworks, the
        religious affiliation of participants is significant. A major challenge in
        interpreting Tibetan art, as well as the art of many non-Western cultures, is
        how to translate subtle spiritual concepts into terms Western visitors can
        understand. All the Tibetan participants consider themselves Buddhists. The
        majority of Swiss self-identified as Christians, with a roughly equal number of
        Catholics and Protestants. An  important demographic for the Tibetans was
        generation. Diaspora populations are notoriously diverse, and the Tibetan
        community is no exception. Table 3 describes the demographic characteristics of
      the Tibetan and Swiss German participants. </p>

      <h1>Preliminary Findings</h1>
      <p>Although data collection and analysis are ongoing, it is
        possible to draw some tentative conclusions based on the data collected so far
        from Swiss participants. The following analysis should be viewed as provisional
        as it may be altered or influenced by future results. Please note that the
        coding protocol used to generate the Word Type calculation is not included;
      however, I can  provide this to anyone interested in further detail.</p>
      <h2>Tagging And Viewing Patterns</h2>
      <p>One striking result is the difference in the volume of tags
        collected from Tibetans and Swiss Germans. Of the 1203 valid tags collected on
        the six images, 485 came from 25 Tibetans and the remaining 718 from 23 Swiss
        Germans. The average tags per tagger per image was 19.4 for Tibetans compared
        with 31.2 for the Swiss. Tibetans submitted fewer tags across the board. Figure
      4 shows the average number of tags collected across all six images.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="mannion.fig4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="400" height="339"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 4: Average valid tags per tagger per image</p>
      <p>There are a number of possible explanations for the
        disparity. The most obvious is that many Tibetans tagged in chaotic
        environments at cultural events whereas all Swiss Germans tagged on-line. Even
        Tibetans who did tag on-line, however, averaged only 24.5 tags per image. There
        are other factors at work which become evident when qualitative data from
        interviews and observations are brought into the picture. Many young Tibetans
        experience discomfort when viewing traditional works of art. In the words of
        one woman disturbed at the prospect of having to tag an image she did not
        recognize: “Looking at these images makes us feel bad, because we don’t know
        anything.” Another tagger also expressed uneasiness, explaining that “…for
        Tibetans it is considered sinful to make a mistake.” Although the diaspora has
        few resources where young people can learn about their visual heritage, there
        is still considerable pressure from the older generation not to let their
        cultural traditions die. One way this “burden of preservation” (see Mannion,
        2007a, p.p. 112-119) manifests is in the reluctance of Tibetans to fully engage
        in tagging or other activities because of the feelings of embarrassment it may
      arouse. </p>
      <p>As the second tagger’s comment indicates, Tibetans are also
        strongly enculturated not to make mistakes when it comes to traditional
        imagery. They are therefore unlikely to guess if they do not know for certain.
        Western taggers looking at the same image do not have such concerns. The high
        tag volume for Brief History of Tibet, the only contemporary image, suggests
        that Tibetans may find it easier to tag an image free of cultural associations,
      because there is no pressure to answer correctly. </p>
      <p>Apart from these emotional issues, the mechanics of tagging
        proved challenging for many Tibetans. Many people perceived it as a test,
        despite efforts to minimize such reactions by introducing the activity in
        neutral and user-friendly language. Although most young Tibetans use the
        Internet regularly for work or school (Piltz, 2006), they do not tag on Flickr
        or YouTube. This caused initial confusion when people were confronted with the
        tagging interface. Some of their tags reflect their difficulties: “what is
        this?” “no idea,” <i>unbekannt</i> (unknown), “<i>schwer
          erkennbar welche gott</i>” (hard to tell which
        deity it is). I further observed that it took people a while (10-15 minutes) to
        get the “hang” of tagging and to begin to enjoy it. Participants spent the
        first part of their session struggling to think of terms, staring at the screen,
        browsing images in the set. After successfully tagging one or two images, they seemed
      to warm up. </p>
      <h2>Tagger Agreement</h2>
      <p>Tagger agreement offers further insight into the two groups’
        distinctive viewing patterns. Figure 5 shows average agreement for the three
        most common tags across the six images. Tibetans showed considerable
        consistency for the traditional images. This confirms that the iconic
        representations have acquired meaning for them through repeated exposure at
        home, school, or temple. Among Swiss participants for whom none of the deities
        or symbols are familiar, taggers responded with personal, idiosyncratic
        interpretations rather than culturally learned ones. The significance of these
        values is reinforced by the fact that Swiss participants submitted 32% more
      tags overall than the Tibetans, thereby increasing their odds of agreement. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="mannion.fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="400" height="268"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 5: Comparing inter-tagger consistency across images</p>
      <p>The high levels of agreement among Tibetans for Wheel of
        Life (38.7%), Avalokitesvara (30.7%), and Padmasambhava (25.3%) are not
        surprising, since these images have particularly strong connections with their
        nation’s culture and history. Images of the Wheel of Life are widely circulated
        as teaching aids for basic Buddhist concepts; Avalokitesvara, the patron deity
        of Tibet, is connected with the Dalai Lama; and Padmasambhava is the historic
        figure who brought Buddhism to Tibet. There is less agreement about
        Chakrasamvara, an image used in tantric (and usually private) meditation
      practice. </p>
      <p>Some intriguing differences in perception emerge in the
        combined agreement. Two images, Wheel of Life and Avalokitesvara, achieved a
        degree of cultural cross-over, evoking similar terms from both Tibetans and
        Westerners. Taggers disagreed in their perceptions of the esoteric deity
        Chakrasamvara. Tibetans tagged it frequently with “buddha”, accurately
        identifying its wisdom aspect; however, Swiss Germans found it <i>böse</i> or “angry-looking” and associated it with death.
        This exemplifies how tags can help uncover cultural misunderstandings: rather
        than anger, Chakrasamvara actually embodies the union of bliss and emptiness.
        Such mistakes made by taggers generate what Trant (2006, p. 16; see<br/>
        also Trant 2006b) refers to as
        “teachable moments.” Another instructive example is the masculine deity of
        compassion Avalokitesvara, that both Tibetan and Western taggers consistently
        identified as female. One quarter (25%) of taggers assigned feminine terms to
        the image, including <i>Göttin</i> (female deity), <i>Mutter</i> (mother),
        and <i>Frau</i> (woman). A logical question
        when interpreting this artwork with viewers is: “Why does this male deity look
      feminine in this image?”</p>
      <h2>Cultural Pervasiveness Of Traditional Images</h2>
      <p>Tibetans may agree on some of the terms used to describe
        traditional images, but do they actually recognize them? Only 1 of 25 Tibetan
        taggers correctly identified all five. (None recognized the contemporary,
        abstract work, which did not contain a central figure.) On the surface, this
        may seem surprising, since Westerners often assume Tibetans are conversant with
        their own cultural imagery. The average rate of correct identification across
        the five traditional artworks was 16.8%. This can largely be attributed to a
        single image, Wheel of Life, which was recognized by 44% of the Tibetan
        participants. Five (22%) Swiss Germans also correctly identified the Wheel of
        Life, confirming the widespread pervasiveness of this symbolic depiction. As
      expected, Swiss participants did not recognize any other traditional images.</p>
      <p>Correct identification is one of several factors which
        reflect an image’s cultural pervasiveness. Table 4 combines six different
        factors into a single rating or index to measure this concept. These include
        non-unique tags, correct identification, the number of correct proper names
        assigned by taggers in different languages, the number of nearly correct
        identifications, overall tagger agreement for the most common tags, and
        semantic diversity of tags assigned. Tag (or semantic) diversity shows the range and character of terms submitted. To calculate this value, tags were first broken up into individual words and then sorted into seven Word Type categories according to a strict coding protocol. The seven categories include: proper name, Buddhist concept, Buddhist noun, verb or action, feeling or vernacular concept, vernacular noun, and non-tag. Standard deviation was applied to calculate variance across these categories.</p>

      <p class="caption">Table 4: Raw values used in cultural pervasiveness rating</p>
      <p>Figure 6 shows the cultural pervasiveness ratings (on a
        scale of 0-100) across the six images. It reinforces an earlier analysis (see
        Mannion 2007b, chap. 9) of correct identification and Word Type that uncovered
        three distinct levels of recognition among Tibetans for traditional imagery:
        iconic or symbolic, familiar, and unfamiliar. Iconic or symbolic images are the
        most culturally pervasive, and, with a score of 37.1, Wheel of Life falls into
        this category. Avalokitesvara and Padmasambhava, both important cultural
        figures, are familiar; and Chakrasamvara and Shri Devi are unfamiliar. Brief
        History is included here in part to demonstrate the validity of this
        measurement. As expected, its rating is low among the Tibetan group. The
        similarity in ratings for the protectress Shri Devi and Brief History can be
        explained by two factors: first, the challenging nature of Shri Devi’s wrathful
        appearance, which is commonly misinterpreted, even by Tibetans; and second,
        Brief History’s abstract composition, which incorporated many traditional
        Tibetan elements; such as the mandala and Kalachakra symbol,  recognized by
      Tibetan viewers.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="mannion.fig6.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="400" height="294"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 6: Comparing cultural pervasiveness across images</p>
      <p>Augmented by interview data, these findings become even more
        meaningful. When Tibetans were asked which images were easiest to tag and why,
        their responses were contradictory. One person said artworks she knew were easy
        to tag because she already has something to say about them. Another found
        unfamiliar works easier to tag because they seemed “freer” The rating indicates
        that symbolic and familiar works do elicit less diverse responses from Tibetan
        taggers. And although some people may find them easier to tag because their
        meanings are culturally pre-defined, the way in which viewers react to them is
        likely to be less personal and even “less free.” Both the high tag volume and
        semantic diversity of the tags assigned to Brief History seem to support this
        hypothesis, although further research is needed. At the very least, the Swiss
        responses demonstrate that totally unfamiliar works can evoke a large number of
        rich and varied terms from taggers. Revisiting this study’s central question,
        we can speculate that while Tibetans may be better at tagging Tibetan art
      correctly, they are unlikely to tag exhaustively or personally.</p>
      <h1>Implications and Conclusions</h1>
      <p>Although this study is still underway and future analysis
        will likely generate additional insights, the preliminary findings with this
        small but consistent data set have important implications for museums. First,
        it is clear that tags have a function beyond simply expanding the vocabulary
        with which museums describe their on-line collections. Tags are clues to the
        ways viewers and visitors perceive images. They are useful tools in
        quantitative studies, and, when combined with qualitative feedback and
        observations of taggers, they can also provide insight into the ways people
        feel and think about the experience of viewing art. These findings can be
      applied in a several ways to improve museum displays of Tibetan art:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Very
          few young Tibetans can correctly identify traditional images, and for many,
          looking at such works evokes feelings of embarrassment. Interpretive materials
          should not assume prior knowledge. Instead, coverage should start at the
          beginning, introducing names and concepts in an extremely friendly and
        non-threatening way. </li>
        <li>Tibetans
          are likely to engage with symbolic images like Wheel of Life in predictable and
          culturally-prescribed ways. Interpretive materials which gently force them out
          of established paths through questioning or other novel approaches could excite
          their curiosity to go beyond what they already know.</li>
        <li>Special
          care should be taken in the presentation of esoteric and wrathful deities,
          since both Western and Tibetan audiences are likely to misunderstand them.
          Interpretive materials might take common misapprehensions as starting points
          and the encourage viewers to examine their first impressions as a means to
          deeper understanding.</li>
        <li>Tibetans’ responses to the contemporary image Brief History
          of Tibet were both diverse and highly personal. It is possible that exhibitions
          which combine contemporary and traditional artworks may be successful at
          attracting younger Tibetans, helping them view traditional imagery through a
          different (and less culturally defined) lens.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As societies worldwide become increasingly multicultural,
        many museums confront the challenges of addressing and serving the needs of
        diverse visitor groups. In the Tibetan situation, and those of other endangered
        cultures, the importance of supporting community agendas takes on special
        urgency.  It is hoped that studies employing social tagging can provide
        valuable insights for the design of virtual and physical exhibitions to  engage
      and enlighten visitors of all kinds.</p>
