      <p class="AbstractText">Virtual Museums face diverse target groups, reaching from young to old, with varying Internet literacy and learning styles. How does one serve these diverse needs efficiently on one platform? How can we implement an accessible learning environment which can be customised to different learning styles? The approach chosen in this project is to provide two basic features: target group profiles and user customization. Target group profiles indicate the different aims that various users have when accessing the Web site. In addition, users themselves are able to tailor the site according to personal learning styles and needs: visually or textually oriented users are able to configure their view of the Museum with a bias towards textual or multimedia material. </p>
      <p class="AbstractText"> From an information technology point of view, the overall task has been to provide the infrastructure needed to enable and preferably enhance the intended features, while getting in the way as little as possible between the content and the visitor. The resulting Web of interconnected information resources and subjects significant to this application both invokes curiosity and provides the visitor with a highly intuitive way of acquiring knowledge.</p>

      <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
      <p>The VIMU
        Project covers 200 years of modern history of the Danish and German borderland.
        The Web site has been realised by four university institutions in Denmark and
        Germany and was co-financed by the European Union. It is the first
        Danish-German history project in the Internet. VIMU is a purely virtual museum;
        it has no physical counterpart. </p>
      <p>The idea
        of the project is to show the regional history of the two countries in multiple
        perspectives, combining knowledge from history, informatics, didactics and
        multimedia experts. Contemporary knowledge and state-of-the-art technology are
        applied to create a modern and lively Web-based history-learning environment.</p>
      <p>The
        concept of the exhibition is to present selected events which took place on
        both sides of the border, ranging from 1830 to 2000. Deliberately, the purpose
        of the project was not to show as much material as possible, but to show
        representative and meaningful occurrences. Actual history didactical standards
        are merged with the Internet medium.</p>
      <p>Thirty-six
        topics with over 250 stories are the ingredients of VIMU. The textual content
        is enriched by 2000 images, 300 complex multimedia animations, 40 films, 30
        audio documents and 4 quiz games for kids. The information architecture is
        realized using the ISO standard of Topic Maps
        (<a href="http://www1.y12.doe.gov/capabilities/sgml/sc34/document/0322.htm">http://www1.y12.doe.gov/capabilities/sgml/sc34/document/0322.htm</a>), which
        allows modularization and semantic linking of the content.</p>
      <p>From
        05/2005-03/2008, the four institutions developed the Virtual Museum. Involved
        in the project &#34;Virtual Museum - living regional history of the Danish
        German border region&#34; are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Institut for Historie, Kultur og
          Samfundsbeskrivelse (SDU, University of Southern Denmark); in charge of:
          selection of stories, historical research</li>
        <li>Institut für Zeit und
          Regionalgeschichte (IZRG, University Flensburg, Germany); in charge of:
          selection of the stories, historical research, didactical concept</li>
        <li>Institut for Fagsprog, Kommunikation
          og Informationsvidenskab (SDU, University of Southern Denmark); in charge of:
          information architecture, programming</li>
        <li>Multimedia Production (University of
          Applied Sciences Kiel, Germany); in charge of: make up of content, usability
          concept </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The
        Virtual Museum project was realised by a core staff of 12 persons and about 20
        graduate assistants. The project has a budget of 1.6 million €.</p>
      <p>This paper is focused on issues of content, editing, and display (multimedia),
        as well as on its information architecture. The criteria for the selection of
        topics and the profound  didactical thought will not be treated in particular
        detail. How to meet diverse users’ needs (from the view of the frontend user),
        and how to handle the technical  implementation angle, are the main focus.</p>
      <h1>2. Features And Principles</h1>
      <p>The
        Virtual Museum addresses a broad audience from both sides of the border regions
        in Denmark and Germany. Furthermore, it presents history to visitors from
        outside the region; for instance, tourists. The audience was categorised into
        six target groups, according to interests and motives which activate a visit: 
        the general users (&#34;explorers&#34;), students, teachers, researchers,
        tourists, and kids.</p>
      <p>The Web
        site is available in Danish and German. It has been a central political and
        historical principle to enable users to switch readily between the two
        languages. This is meant to increase mutual understanding and at the same time
        provide the option of multi-perspective views.</p>
      <p>How is it
        possible to produce and edit content which finds a balance between the needs of
        the target groups and the limitations of  budget? The idea is to have basic
        material which serves all, and then target group-specific extra material.
        Students are provided with school material and special references; teachers get
        learning sequences, reviews and references; tourists are offered trip
        suggestions and specific tourist info, and so forth. The exception to the rule
        is the target group of children. Since they have a completely different way of
        receiving information, their content is designed differently.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a><a href="granlie-fig1.html"><img src="granlie_fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="155"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="granlie-fig1.html">Fig 1: The VIMU target groups with
        allocation of content</a></p>
      <p>The
        information concept of the Web site follows didactical considerations. The
        basic principle of the layout of the site is to keep it as simple and clear as
        possible to enable  good orientation. The use of the
        Web site should be intuitively understandable for visitors of varying computer
        and Internet literacy. In order to reduce potential information
        overload, the content on the pages is deliberately displayed according to the
        profiles of the target groups. The visualisation of content can be further customised
        to personal needs: fonts sizes and background colour can be changed; animated
        material can be replaced by static design. </p>
      <p>A basic
        principle is the implementation of accessibility. Considering different systems
        and hardware which people use to access the content, this aspect has been
        strongly stressed. The construction of the site follows standards provided by
        the W3 (http://www.w3.org/). The basic guideline for making the content accessible has been the
        German BITV (http://www.einfach-fuer-alle.de/artikel/bitv/anlage-1/).</p>
      <p>The digital medium
        is non-linear. Therefore, it has been a crucial part of the usability concept
        to implement different navigations and entry points to the content. In order to
        address and attract all potential visitors, including both those who are
        familiar with navigating in digital environments and novice learners, several
        navigational options of different complexity are implemented in the Virtual
        Museum. On the Welcome page, for example, visitors are given several entry
        points and navigational options enabling access to the stories. They have
        choices of entering the exhibition via the main navigation bar, via timeline,
        via sitemap, or via the search function. The provision of alternatives enables
        visitors to approach the historical stories on self-chosen paths which can be
        one of guided or interactive, fast or indirect, visually or textually based. </p>
      <p>Once visitors leave
        the Welcome page of the virtual museum, they find that generally the material
        about a certain topic is presented in several layers of increasing detail:
        While the very top level provides a rough, summarizing overview of the story
        which can quickly and easily be perceived, the bottom level contains particular
        information on subordinated aspects. Thus, visitors are given the opportunity
        to choose how much they want to know and are able to go into more or less
        depth, led by their personal interests.</p>
      <p>Different learning
        styles are met by differently designed material: complex multimedia animation
        can be browsed by either a linear or an explorative navigation; animated
        content can be replaced by static material.</p>
      <h1>3. How To Serve A Diverse Audience On One Platform
        Efficiently</h1>
      <p>People
        are different. The diverse audience virtual museums are facing ranges from
        young to old, with varying Internet literacy and learning styles, and different
        reasons for entering the Web site. How do we serve these needs, considering a
        limited amount of time and budget?</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a><a href="granlie-fig2.html"><img src="granlie_fig2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="400" height="128"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="granlie-fig2.html">Fig 2: Illustration – Content,
        Programming, Interface and Users</a></p>
      <p>The figure above 
        illustrates this problem. A large body of historical material is divided 
        into smaller items, which are then assembled into different collections, 
        each tailored for a specific part of the highly diverse audience.</p>
      <p>The basic
        idea of the Virtual Museum project is to modularise the content into small and
        flexible units which can then be accommodated to a certain extent by <b>given
        profiles</b> (editorial) and <b>personalised profiles</b> (individual). </p>
      <h2>Given Profiles</h2>
      <p>The term
        &#34;given profiles&#34; implies that not all the content is shown to all of
        the audience at all times. In order to reduce the information displayed on a
        single page, content units are preselected by the editors according to
        previously defined criteria. These criteria follow the users’ needs and motives
        when accessing the Web site.</p>
      <p>When
        users enters the Web site via vimu.info, they are initially located in the
        target group of explorer (general user). Users can then select one of the
        target groups or stay within the default group, depending on their personal motives.
        The option to change the target group is available at any time.</p>
      <p>Each
        target group has an<i> adjusted Home Page</i>. Adjusted Home Pages offer general
        information, but also indicate target-group-specific material. A map of the
        region enables tourists to find stories connected to a town or a geographical
        spot. The homepage of the teachers indicates where to find learning sequences
        and topics of high value for class lessons. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a><a href="granlie-fig3.html"><img src="granlie_fig3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="400" height="324"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="granlie-fig3.html">Fig 3: The Home Page of VIMU for the
        general target group</a></p>
      <p>The <i>story
        pages</i> are the core
        pages within VIMU. Here one specific story is told by textual and visual
        content units. The construction generally stays the same within the different
        profiles: it consists of the story and the related material. The inline-promoted
        formats will be adjusted according to the target group profiles: students get
        more visual material like videos and multimedia formats, whereas researchers
        get more info about background aspects and references. </p>
      <p>The order
        of the related formats which are positioned in the right column of the Web site
        are adjusted according to the specific interests of the target groups: the more
        valuable a format tends to be for a target group, the more prominently it is
        positioned. The order is defined in the given profiles.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig4" id="fig4"></a><a href="granlie-fig4.html"><img src="granlie_fig4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="400" height="364"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="granlie-fig4.html">Fig 4: Screenshot of the &#34;story
        page&#34; with adjusted inline teasers and the adjusted order of formats
        (cutout)</a></p>
      <h2>Personalised Profiles</h2>
      <p>Users
        have the option to customise the visual appearance of their pages according to
        personal preferences and needs. In terms of reading the text, they can adjust
        the font size, the running length and the contrast.<b> </b> Elderly people mainly make intense use of the option to change the font size,
        but  people with visual impairment also use these functions.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a><a href="granlie-fig5.html"><img src="granlie_fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="300" height="248"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="granlie-fig5.html">Fig 5: The configuration icons to
        personalise the page</a></p>
      <p>In terms
        of learning styles, people have the option to make certain adjustments.
        Visitors can choose between animated and static content. The reason can be
        manifold: people who are less familiar with navigation on the Web might be more
        comfortable with non-animated content, whereas experienced users tend to be
        attracted and motivated by animated content. Furthermore, visitors can choose
        between more explorative Flash applications and more linear HTML visualisation.
        At the same time, more linear information serves visitors accessing the
        platform with hardware like screen readers.</p>
      <p>In
        practice, the personal adjustments can be made either along the way or on a
        central personalisation page. Adjustments are saved in a cookie or – if
        the user is registered –  in the user’s personal preferences. </p>
      <h2>Provision Of Multiple Navigation Systems</h2>
      <p>In
        physical museums, visitors usually have a designated path which leads them
        through the exhibition. The Virtual Museum encourages visitors to find their
        own path through the exhibition by offering several potential paths to the
        content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigation via menu bars tends to be
          most familiar to Internet users since this is the classical way of accessing
          Web sites. Accordingly, the majority of the virtual museum’s visitors are
          likely to use it.</li>
        <li>Navigation via a timeline puts the
          content into a chronological framework and creates selected time-based entry
          points to the collection.</li>
        <li>Sitemaps enable visitors to spot the
          links they wish to access. They usually visualise the entire content structure
          of the Web site and provide a good overview.</li>
        <li>The search function provides direct
          access to the desired content for visitors who have a certain target in mind
          when they enter the virtual museum.</li>
        <li>A new and innovative way of
          navigation is the so-called &#34;spider&#34;. This linked visualisation of
          the content enables the visitor to browse along semantic conjunctions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig6" id="fig6"></a><a href="granlie-fig6.html"><img src="granlie_fig6.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="400" height="255"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="granlie-fig6.html">Fig 6: &#34;Spider&#34; - semantic
        conjunction of content</a></p>
      <p>The
        navigation systems range from having a very linear structure to a very
        explorative and, in the case of the spider, to even semantic structures. While
        experts are likely to favour interactive reference sites, directed activities
        tend to be of higher motivational value for novice learners who prefer to be
        introduced into the unknown topic. </p>
      <p>Offering
        extensive navigational alternatives allows visitors choose their path according
        to their individual capacities and preferences.</p>
      <h1>4. Technical Considerations</h1>
      <p>From a technical
        point of view, several problems have been solved in order to meet the requirements
        of the Virtual Museum. First of all, the available historical material has been
        standardized and made available on the Virtual Museum Web site. Secondly, the
        differentiated views of the content necessitated by the previously-mentioned
        six target groups have been implemented. Finally, the facility for visitors&#39;
        seamless switch between the two languages of the Virtual Museum has been
        implemented. </p>
      <p>In addition to this,
        a couple of semantic features have been implemented. Most notable is the integration
        of an interactive application which visualizes the implicit semantic relations
        between historical events, actors, and places, and connects this abstract
        knowledge structure to the actual content, effectively providing the visitor
        with a means of associative navigation. Besides this, a semantic search has
        been integrated into the site as well. This section will shed light on some of
        the technical measures which have been taken in order to achieve these
        features.</p>
      <h2>Information System</h2>
      <p>The Virtual Museum
        is essentially a semantic portal, in the sense that it is a relatively
        content-heavy Web site which is completely ontology-based. In order to
        elaborate further on the underlying information system and the technical
        foundation of the Web site in general, it is necessary briefly to outline this
        ontology. In our case the &#39;domain&#39; in question actually consists of two equal
        parts. One is the actual historical space, understood as the time and physical
        space in which the events of the period in question took place, and the other
        is the very structure of the historical material written for publication on the
        site. </p>
      <p>This material is
        organized according to a so-called didactical concept which has been prepared
        by our project partners at the Universität Flensburg (Danker, 2004). The
        didactical concept essentially breaks the historical content down into a number
        of manageable learning units, which are assembled into a number of meaningful
        sets, each concerned with a rather narrowly confined area of the border
        region&#39;s history. The learning units are distributed between four main levels
        in a partly hierarchical structure: six <i>Dimensions</i> each define some extremely broad themes, whose
        purpose is primarily to invoke the visitor&#39;s curiosity, and secondly to act as
        containers for a total of 36 <i>Topics</i>.
        These topics are in turn concerned with more narrowly defined historical
        subjects, and each of them contains between six and eight <i>Modules</i>, or stories. The story level is in practice
        the most essential one, since this is where the actual content is located. A
        story consists of a longer text and any number of the last type of building
        blocks, somewhat ambiguously named ­<i>Formats</i>, which are essentially small packages
        typically consisting of an annotated multimedia resource. This resource
        constitutes the smallest indivisible unit of the system, and it is highly
        significant that a multimedia resource cannot be used anywhere on the site without
        annotation, reference, etc. </p>
      <p>The part of the
        ontology which models the structure of the content is thus a formalized version
        of the didactical concept. Each learning unit has its own representation within
        the ontology, and each unit is connected to the others by means of one or
        several semantic relations. Since a learning unit can be related to any number of other 
        learning units, it would effectively be possible to create custom 
        learning sequences, even after the full implementation of the Web site. However, only the learning units on
        the two lowest levels of the system can be freely resampled.</p>
      <p>Since the didactical
        concept was present very early in the project phase, it was natural to start
        out by modeling this part of the ontology first, even though it may seem like a
        somewhat backward approach. Also, there was a very early need for a functioning
        pilot version of the Web site, and an ontological implementation of the content
        structure was a significant prerequisite in this respect. Thus, the Virtual
        Museum Web site has in practice been built up around this part of the ontology.
        However, in order to be able to navigate the site along the implicit semantic
        relations, the content needs to be linked to a semantic model of the historical
        domain. This effectively makes it possible to associate a given subject such as
        a specific historical person or a certain event to all available information
        resources logically concerned with this subject. </p>
      <h2>Practical Approach</h2>
      <p>Connecting nodes in advanced
        knowledge structures to specific information resources is one of the main virtues
        inherent in Topic Maps (Pepper), and so it has been decided to implement the
        ontology using Topic Maps. While it would not be strictly necessary to have the
        content described using an ontology under more general circumstances, it makes
        good sense when using Topic Maps. </p>
      <p>The very first task
        was to standardize all content units in close cooperation with the historians.
        This produced a list of well-defined units, from which possible data types and
        possible semantic relations were relatively evident. This list was not only
        useful for the technical staff; but it also turned out to be highly useful for
        the historians as a sort of writing manual. The definition of the units that
        are able to contain other units was relatively straightforward: dimensions,
        topics and modules should have some kind of descriptive text associated, as
        well as a piece of multimedia used for graphical navigation. In addition to
        this, modules should contain a longer text, a bibliography, an  author&#39;s
        signature, and of course a number of formats. Many of these formats were
        naturally much more diverse, but some were quite simple. Thus,
        &#34;Video&#34; and &#34;Audio&#34; as a starting point consist of a
        reference to a multimedia file, a source reference, and some kind of
        annotation. Other formats have much wider implications. &#34;Biography&#34;
        is a good example of this, as it pieced together several entities. At a
        minimum, a biography should comprise a text describing the subject, an image of
        the person, and dates and places of birth and death. Some of this information
        is more closely associated to the biography as a content unit, and some more
        closely to the person as an abstract subject. Thus, the textual description is
        naturally part of the biography, while the image rather describes the person
        (actually, images in this context are generally used as tokens for digitally
        representing real-world subjects). Furthermore, the image itself could very
        well be part of a separate format. Dates and places of birth and death are also
        &#39;native&#39; to the person – but since a place is a subject in its own right,
        persons&#39; births and deaths at certain locations are expressed by means of
        associations. Thus, persons related to a given location will be clearly implied
        in the ontology.</p>

        possible to associate information resources with abstract subjects.</a></p>
      <p>The semantics of the
        type of relation between most of the content units is quite obvious: a dimension
        can contain a number of topics, while a topic can be contained within a
        dimension, and so on. Thus, the relation type could be described as the
        predicate <i>contained-in(container, containee)</i>, which is a standard Topic Map relation type.
        Similarly, in the example above there would be a <i>describes</i>-association between a <i>biography</i> or an <i>image</i> and a <i>person</i>, and <i>died-in</i> and <i>born-in</i> relations, respectively, between <i>persons</i> and <i>locations. </i>The entities needed to complete a biography
        format belong in both spheres of the ontology, and thus a biography serves as a
        good example of the interlinked nature or the two ontology parts, and the
        benefits derived thereof.</p>
      <h2>Topic Map Specific Issues</h2>
      <p>While it is generally advisable to implement some sort of 
        content management systems for larger scaled Web sites, it has not been 
        a viable option in our case. A central prerequisite for such a system is 
        an absolutely fixed content structure, which would have been 
        counterproductive in this particular case. Quite simply, both the 
        historical and technical staff needed the flexibility of being able to 
        perform extensive changes to the content structure along the way. 
        Consequently, the material has been implemented manually.</p>
      <p>In order to produce
        the differentiated views needed for the various target groups, a feature
        specific to Topic Maps has been used. According to the standard it is possible
        to add scope to associations, subjects, and connected information resources. Topic Map scope has been widely implemented as an effective 
        means of establishing a connection between a target group and the 
        information resources particular to it. Also, the German and Danish 
        versions of the content have been accordingly scoped.</p>
      <p>While several possible notations for Topic Maps exist, we 
        have chosen the Linear Topic Map Notation (LTM) for its compact syntax, 
        which closely resembles that of tolog, a Topic Map querying language
        LTM is a text format, meaning that the entire data backend of the Virtual
        Museum has to be written as text files – and effectively, one large Topic
        Map comprising all of the material is needed. Due to the facility of merging
        particular to Topic Maps, it has however been possible to modularize the LTM
        code by writing one module at a time, and it is then merged into the rest of
        the content. This technique greatly facilitates the implementation of content,
        and gives the additional advantage that it is simple to remove and reinsert
        specific parts of the content. While shorter texts are stored directly in the
        Topic Map ontology, longer bodies of text are stored in external XML files. A
        custom XML application has been selected for this purpose, in favor of a
        predefined language such as DocBook. This is because only a very small amount
        of formatting is actually necessary in this case. The XML documents are processed
        and tailored to the Web site front-end using XSLT style sheets.</p>
      <h2>Interoperability Considerations</h2>
      <p>A large portion of
        the Virtual Museum content is Flash-based. Since there is no obvious way of
        querying the Topic Map from external applications, a standardized exchange
        format was needed in order to enable Flash applications to interact with the
        data back-end. For example, the previously mentioned semantic navigation
        application needs a standardized version of the Topic Map data in order to show
        continuously updated information about both semantic and content-specific
        relations on the Web site front-end. Several XML standards for Topic Map
        notation exist, but once again a very simple custom XML language has been
        created. It simply models the associated nodes around a central node, with some
        additional information such as type of relation, name of subject, and the like.
        Presently, only one level of related nodes is taken into account, but this
        could of course be easily extended. On a longer perspective, this exchange
        format could also become the basis of interoperability with similar portals
        across the Internet. In addition, portions of the Virtual Museum content will
        be syndicated through various RSS feeds for easy use by third parties such as
        schools or similar portals.</p>
      <h1>5. Conclusion</h1>
      <p>For
        decades, pupils learned about history from books. Animations, sound and videos
        hardly found their way into the classrooms due to cost and high effort. A lot
        of organisation was connected with watching one single video, for example.
        After rounding up the equipment, teachers had to organise the video, and plug
        in the right cables for the television and the video recorder. Nowadays
        computers offer the chance to watch videos, listen to interviews with witnesses
        to history, and show complex coherences with a simplified animation -all from
        one single platform. Interactive historical learning environments, which are
        equipped with multimedia formats and can be accessed on multiple paths, offer a
        great opportunity for pupils to gain a stronger interest in their own past and
        history. </p>
      <p>The
        Virtual Museum project has brought together the common history of two regions 
        located in two different countries. The permanent and bilingual availability of
        historical materials and targeted information for residents, students,
        children, tourists, and researchers could lead to even stronger mutual
        understanding and social, cultural and economic exchange. </p>
