  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The National Museums Online Learning Project has been
    developed by a consortium of national museums and galleries within the United
    Kingdom and is a 3-year project funded by Treasury. The institutions involved
    in the project are the British Museum, Imperial War Museum, Natural History
    Museum, National Portrait Gallery, Royal Armouries Museum, Sir John Soane&#39;s
    Museum, Tate, Wallace Collection and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (the
    lead partner). </p>
  <p>The museums and galleries collaborating on the National
    Museums Online Learning Project each have different technical set-ups. The
    majority have different Content Management Systems and different Collection
    Management Systems. The sizes of the organisations also range from around 50 to
    around  1,000 employees. Each
    partner has a wealth of content, ranging from Rodin sculptures through to King
    Henry VIII’s armour, via William Morris textiles. Being able to search across
    all of the available on-line resources in an intuitive manner was deemed
    crucial to enabling a cohesive user experience for the Web resources that are
    being created as part of the project. </p>
  <p>If we were to envision what we were trying to do outside of
    the Web sphere, then a particularly beneficial comparison would be to
    department stores. Back in the echelons of time when people went shopping, they
    had to visit multiple shops to obtain all that they required, walking up and
    down the high street visiting many different shops. The introduction of
    department stores enabled people, or customers, to be able to go into one shop
    and get, in one place, all the furniture, food, electronics or other goods they
    required. Using this model it&#39;s clear to see how creating a &#39;one-stop-shop&#39; for
    obtaining resources and objects from each of the partners would clearly benefit
    users of this project.</p>
  <p>The aims of the project are to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase
      the use of the existing digital collections of the 9 partners, without adding
      new content (e.g. more digitisation) or creating a new Web site or museum
      portal</li>
    <li>Encourage
      a more creative and critical use of partners’ on-line resources</li>
    <li>Increase
      confidence levels in the use of collections</li>
    <li>Create
      sustainable high-quality on-line resources for each of the participating
      partners </li>
    <li>Strengthen
      the partnership between the participating institutions &amp; develop
      collaborative working models between partners.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It has been decided to do this through WebQuests and Creative
    Journeys. </p>
  <h2>WebQuests</h2>
  <p>WebQuests are guided, open-ended activities which are based
    around topics and subject areas mapped to the English national curriculum. At
    least 3 different partners collaborate on each WebQuest, with objects coming
    from across the partner collections. The project will create 100 WebQuests.</p>
  <p>WebQuests were invented by Bernie Dodge and Tom March <a href="http://edweb.sdsu.edu/people/bdodge/bdodge.html" title="http://edweb.sdsu.edu/people/bdodge/bdodge.html"></a>at San Diego State
    University in 1995. Dodge (1995) defines a WebQuest as &#34;an
    inquiry-oriented activity in which some or all of the information that learners
    interact with comes from resources on the internet&#34;. While the working
    title of this part of the project is called WebQuests, the structure and layout
    of the WebQuests created by the project has been significantly modified from
    the original model although the underlying educational methodology remains the
    same. </p>
  <h2>Creative Journeys</h2>
  <p>Creative Journeys aim to show how people have made use of
    museum and gallery objects in their own personal activities – in
    sculpting, designing clothes or writing novels, for example. They give users an
    opportunity to personalise their relationship with the collections by using new
    technologies to record and share their journeys with each other. From this they
    increase user confidence and  give
    users skill-building activities to encourage and support their participation. </p>
  <p>With the development of ideas for both these resources, what
    became obvious to the project team and partners very early on was that the
    users, whether formal or lifelong learners, would need a flexible and intuitive
    process through which they could search across the partner collections to
    obtain the virtual objects they required. The option of having nine search
    boxes, or even nine pop-up windows, was deemed to be &#39;too 1990s&#39;. Ensuring a
    good user experience is paramount to any successful Web project and central to
    this project.</p>
  <h1>Deep and Dark</h1>
  <p>The history of searching across the Internet is wide and
    varied, and any in-depth review or analysis of it is outside the scope of this
    paper. But it is important to give a brief background to enable an
    understanding of how recent this technology is. Gerard Salton is commonly known
    as the father of modern searching;  his teams at Harvard and Cornell developed the SMART informational
    retrieval system. Searching is still based upon many of the concepts he
    developed and tests he carried out, including the Term Frequency (TF) and
    relevancy feedback mechanisms (Salton, 1987). These concepts are relevant for
    the federated search for the project. From here we can jump forward a few years
    to when Larry met Sergey at Stanford in 1995. Three years, later their search
    engine called BackRub became Google. Modern Internet searching was born, and
    this is the environment we currently find ourselves in. </p>
  <p>But how do search engines work? The majority of them create
    their indices by spidering Web pages. More often a page must be static and
    linked to other pages to be discovered. Deep Web resources are not seen or
    retrieved. These deep Web resources take many forms different from private Web
    sites that require a username and password to non-html content in formats not
    handled by search engines (Bergman, 2001). In the case of this project, the
    deep Web refers to dynamic content (pages which are created dynamically) and
    unlinked content (stand alone pages). A certain percentage of the partner
    Collection Management Systems are hidden in the deep Web since the content is stored
    in searchable databases that return results dynamically. Determining how we
    were going to access this content was a major challenge of the project. We
    needed to come up with a way of retrieving, qualifying and organising both
    ‘deep’ and ‘surface’ content. </p>
  <p>These two processes of searching for ‘deep’ and ‘surface’
    content is shown in figure 1 (reworked from a diagram by Bergman, 2001). The
    first process shows how the searching of the surface Web could be carried out
    by traditional search engines. The small and simple telescope can see and
    retrieve all of the near earth objects. These are the collection objects and
    Web pages that are based on the surface Web. The second process shows the type
    of data that would be available for use in the project if we could gain access
    into the deep Web contained within our partner collections – in this case
    represented by a direct link to the Hubble telescope. By combining these two
    methods, a wealth of collections data can be made available. </p>
  <p>While resources from the main partner Web sites would be
    used within the project, it was more important that users gain access to object
    level searching – contained within the deep Web. As detailed above,
    traditional search engines can only access the surface Web. This is where the partner
    Web sites would reside. The on-line collection databases were lurking in the
    deep Web.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="makewell-fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="420" height="531"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 1:  Showing
    how partner collections could be accessed </p>
  <p>Effectively searching across these different resources
    without having to visit each database individually meant that federated
    searching needed to be investigated. Peter Jasco (2004) stated that a federated
    search consists of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transformation
      of a query and broadcast of it to a group of disparate databases with the
      appropriate syntax</li>
    <li>Merging
      of the results collected from the databases</li>
    <li>Presentation
      of them in a succinct and unified format with minimal duplication</li>
    <li>Provision
      of a means, performed either automatically or by the portal user, to sort the
      merged result set </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Federated searching would allow for a &#34;one stop
    searching shop&#34;. It would enable users to have a seamless experience with
    reduced time involved in searching for information and would take pressure off
    their having to decide which database/web site to search. For novice Web users
    or younger children, this would be invaluable. It would also allow for the
    less-accessed collections of some partners to have increased usage. One issue
    that was quickly identified was that with simpler versions of federated
    searches, the advanced search features are sometimes lost, and it is often hard
    to obtain relevancy ranking.</p>
  <p>It was determined that a prototype needed to be developed to
    investigate the potential advantages and disadvantages of the chosen model. The
    project Technical Advisory Group analysed the possible solutions at the same
    time as determining the requirements of the prototype. It was deemed that the
    chosen technical solution must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide
      an effortless, timely and cost effective implementation to ensure a lowering of
      barriers for partners</li>
    <li>Allow
      for searching at both Web site and object/collections level across multiple
      partners</li>
    <li>Allow
      for relevance ranking of results</li>
    <li>Work
      through HTTP</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once the initial requirements were determined, we set about
    investigating the technology and processes that were being used, both inside
    and outside of the sector, for federated searching. The debates that arose
    regarding the different possible solutions proved to be engaging and thought
    provoking. </p>
  <h1>The Investigation</h1>
  <p>Throughout the investigation into which type of federated
    search to prototype, we had to integrate into the process certain rationales
    which were unique to the project. These included time scales and the resources
    available. The project is multi-partnered, and there are vast differences in
    terms of technical capability and capacity of the partners. It was critical to
    understand the extent of these differences and their potential impact when
    considering a federated search, since the technical work would have to be
    carried out with each of the different partners individually. However, an
    element of economy of scale would of course come into practice throughout the
    process. The National Museums Online Learning Project is the first time that
    these particular national museums within the United Kingdom have collaborated
    on a project. As such, the project is large and complex and requires a high
    level of management oversight to ensure that the best practices and procedures
    are used and a coherent and suitable project framework is utilised. </p>
  <p>When investigating federated searching, it was decided that
    the correct choice of technology was imperative. This choice would have to be
    evaluated as to how it fitted in to the constraints of the project. It was
    apparent quite quickly that there were two main processes of federated
    searching which were applicable within the project. The first process involved
    collecting meta-data from each of the databases that needed to be searched and
    then storing them in a central repository. This central repository could then
    be searched. When users found the meta-data of the required results item, they
    would be able to access the full record on the partner Web site. The second
    process involved utilising all of the partners’ current infrastructures and
    search procedures by sending a single request out to all of them and then
    aggregating the results to return to the user. Both of these approaches have
    their advantages and disadvantaged when aligned to the requirements of the
    project. We decided to investigate both of these processes further before
    making any final decision. </p>
  <h2>Open Archives Initiative</h2>
  <p>The first type of federated searching we investigated was
    the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Meta-data Harvesting (OAI-PMH). OAI
    (as it is commonly known) is a process through which meta-data can be stored
    and accessed over the Internet. The processes that are set up collect the
    meta-data descriptions of the records into a central repository, and services
    are then built around this meta-data. This open standard supports any meta-data
    schema, with the base schema being Dublin Core. Figure 2 details the process
    which we studied for implementation of OAI within the project. First, the user
    enters a search term into the federated search. In the case of the project, the
    federated search would not reside in one place, but would be replicated across
    all the partner Web sites. The federated search application then relays this
    query to the meta-data repository. The objects in the repository are queried
    and the OAI results are returned to the origin of the search (in this case, one
    of the partner Web sites). The federated search application parses the results,
    and they are displayed to the user. The user then selects the required result
    and is taken to the full collection object record on the specific partner Web
    site.</p>
  <p>This approach has been implemented with the People&#39;s Network
    Discover Service (<a href="http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/discover/">http:/www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/discover/</a>) in the United
    Kingdom and has been well documented at numerous museum conferences. This same
    repository has also been implemented in the Exploring 20<sup>th</sup> Century
    London project (<a href="http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/">http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/</a>). Cole et al (2002) detail
    the processes and the lessons learned during the creating of OAI-compliant
    meta-data at the University of Illinois Library. Zilber and Marsh (2007)
    further expand this to detail how their project used OAI to show how “a deep
    understanding of users’ thought processes, combined with appropriate meta-data
    standards and an effective meta-data system, can expose content providers’
    resources in a manner that makes them truly accessible and useful”. The
    complexities of implementing OAI within any sizeable project are well
    documented, and this learned data was fully analysed and utilised at the
    evaluation stage. This includes all content providers mapping their data sets
    to a common standard and the implementation of the harvesting methods. </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="makewell-fig2.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="372" height="432"/></p>
  <p class="caption">    Fig 2:  Showing how OAI could be
    implemented in the project</p>
  <h2>Opensearch</h2>
  <p>The second type of federated searching we investigated was
    Opensearch. Opensearch is a light-weight Web protocol which was originally
    developed by Amazon.com as part of the A9.com project which went live in 2004.
    Since then, Opensearch has moved to a community process at www.opensearch.org.
    Opensearch allows users to search through distributed databases and Web sites through
    one interface without visiting each site. Importantly, it would make use of the
    current searching mechanisms implemented on each partner site. From a central
    search interface, queries are sent off to the separate Web sites or databases.
    These are then queried through their current search procedures and the results
    sent back via an RSS or Atom feed. Figure 3 shows the process which we studied
    concerning the possible implementation of Opensearch within the project, as
    detailed above.</p>
  <p>Opensearch has not been implemented within the sector as
    much as OAI, although the Powerhouse museum in Australia has implemented it in
    conjunction with their collections search. Chan (2007) details this process and
    how search results can be fed to users without needing to harvest records.
    These processes have also been implemented on a larger scale with the
    Collections Australia Network (<a href="http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/">http://www.collectionsaustralia.net</a>). </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="makewell-fig3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="420" height="393"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 3:  Showing
    how Opensearch could be implemented in the project</p>
  <h2>Another Option: SRU</h2>
  <p>Closely related to Opensearch, SRU (search/retrieve via URL)
    is a similarly lightweight protocol, much of which is derived from Z39.50. This
    older protocol is widely used by libraries and was first developed in the
    1970s. With the advent of the Internet, and the development of XML, this older
    protocol could now be used over the Web. As a result, the best parts of the
    protocol were taken over and developed into SRU. </p>
  <p>SRU has the capability to understand more of the search
    target than Opensearch. Opensearch simply enables keyword searches. The
    strength of SRU is in searching across the unstructured servers and files that
    a multi-partnered project such as this contains. It also allows for the use of
    advanced searching. </p>
  <h1>Evaluation</h1>
  <p>The possible processes through which a federated search
    could be carried out can be seen as on a continuum from simple technology with
    a simple interface through to the use of complicated technology with an
    advanced interface. More often than not, when implementing digital projects,
    the more complicated technology and interface is deemed appropriate for
    differing reasons.</p>
  <p>When evaluating the most appropriate solution for the
    project we examined the processes which each partner would have to undertake to
    implement the federated search. For OAI, each partner would be a data provider
    and support the OAI as a means of exposing meta-data from their collections.
    Each partner would also be a service provider and use the meta-data harvested
    via OAI for searching across the collections. Each partner is also a service
    provider because the project resources and solutions are spread across the
    partner Web sites and each would need to be able to run the federated search
    independently. Meta-data, representing a skim of the collections, would be
    stored in a central repository which would then be made searchable. This would
    involve a significant amount of work for each partner, from scoping through to
    actual implementation. If the decision were taken to implement OAI, this would
    mean that one of the project partners would need to host the repository to
    store the meta-data. An external partner could also be used, but this would
    introduce an unknown element into the mix. All collections data would still be
    stored on the partner Web sites but there would be a central repository with
    meta-data from the collections. This would mean one partner taking more of the
    load or working with a third party. This could be deemed to not fulfill the
    requirements of this project since the resources would no longer be shared
    throughout the original partnership. </p>
  <p>For Opensearch, if a partner already had a collection search
    engine, then a micro-application would be used to return search results from
    that existing search in RSS/Atom with Opensearch response elements. In some
    cases the partners could use their current systems to serve out the feed rather
    than using an additional micro-application. An example is that numerous
    partners implement Lucene which provides the ability to do this via Nutch. </p>
  <p>Only the partner museums would be involved in implementing
    and using Opensearch since there is no central repository. The processes would
    be much simpler and easier for the partners to implement since the current
    infrastructure would be utilised within a simple search interface. SRU would
    advance upon this, but would involve a higher level of internal working for the
    partners and thus a higher level of resource allocation on their part.</p>
  <p>The requirements of the prototype, along with specific
    project constraints, led the Technical Advisory Group to the decision that
    Opensearch would be prototyped. Opensearch fulfilled all the necessary
    requirements of the prototype, such as working through HTTP as well as providing
    a simple implementation process in comparison to either OAI or SRU. Both OAI
    and SRU would enable object data to be used in a more integrated fashion, but,
    as mentioned before, due to the time, resources and cost involved, these were
    not feasible solutions for this project. Opensearch also answered the
    constraints and sustainability questions of the project. On completion, the
    resources that remain must be fully supportable and sustainable by the
    partners. </p>
  <p>The National Museums Online Learning Project has a
    three-year timescale and is due for completion in March 2009. At the end of
    2007, following a strict EU defined timetable for procurement, two digital
    agencies were brought onboard to facilitate the design and implementation of
    the two separate elements of the project – WebQuests and Creative
    Journeys. This included assistance with the development of the federated search
    (included as part of the WebQuest package). The introduction of the agencies
    marked a new phase in the project where the work of the previous year could
    start to be realised. A large amount of research and evaluation had already
    been carried out  into the possible
    technical solutions for the project as a whole – of which the federated
    search was only a small part.</p>
  <h1>Implementation</h1>
  <p>The next stage involved undertaking the actual
    implementation of the federated search prototype. The realisation of such a
    prototype would have to be correctly scheduled for each of the partners due to
    the development time involved and the working partnership element. Three
    partners agreed to take part in the prototype of the Opensearch implementation,
    led by the project technical manager. The prototype is under development, and
    it is planned that it will be delivered by April 2008. This will allow for the
    integration of this search into the project’s main resources –  WebQuests and Creative Journeys. </p>
  <p>In planning the prototype, the main topics which needed
    direct attention included the lack of similar standards among the partners and
    the process through which the ranking of the search results would be carried
    out. There are different mechanisms of federated searching, and each of them
    allows for different levels of interactivity between the user and the
    collections. Opensearch does not provide the same possibilities as SRU or OAI
    at the level of advanced searching, but for the purposes of our project it
    fitted perfectly. Ease of implementation simply outweighed the option of
    advanced functionality. </p>
  <p>The implementation of Opensearch within the project is the
    second known time that this technology has been used within the sector on such
    a scale – certainly the first time in the northern hemisphere.
    Historically the cultural sector has implemented more projects involving OAI
    for federated searching. Opensearch is a fairly new implementation of
    established technology which has not yet really filtered down into the sector.
    Within the remit of the project it has fitted perfectly to what we wanted to
    accomplish. As mentioned previously, the Powerhouse Museum in Australia has
    also carried out analysis in the area of Opensearch. It was in the initial
    phase of their project with CAN (Collections Australia Network) that it was
    decided to implement Opensearch. </p>
  <h1>Conclusions</h1>
  <p>The federated search provides a simple and intuitive process
    through which users are able to search for ‘deep’ and ‘surface’ Web objects
    across the partners. These collections objects will be employed within
    WebQuests and Creative Journeys from this search to great effect. The
    implementation of the federated search will contribute to the delivery of an
    extremely successful and ambitious project within the sector, providing users
    with a more accessible, direct and user-friendly route to the partner
    collections. By using open standards, the project partners will also be
    able to easily implement the technology they have learnt in other projects.
    This is an important element of the project – ensuring that the learning
    has been shared and the knowledge disseminated throughout the sector and
    beyond.</p>
  <p>Following the completion of the federated search prototype
    in April 2008, a full analysis and evaluation will be carried out. If the
    prototype is deemed successful within the remit of the project, then a full
    federated search will be undertaken involving all partners. In parallel to the
    development of the federated search, the main resources of the project will be
    under development. The federated search will then be integrated into these
    resources.</p>
  <p>The collaboration between the partners has allowed for
    successes to be shared and for knowledge to be reciprocated across and through
    networks which would not have existed otherwise. This atmosphere of
    collaboration on this multi-faceted project, of which the Opensearch
    implementation is only a small part, has allowed for knowledge to flow not only
    from the larger partners to the smaller ones, but also vise versa. </p>
  <p>The production of a federated search across multiple
    partners would, until recently, have been an expensive undertaking. The
    implementation of an uncomplicated, scalable technology such as Opensearch will
    allow for even the smaller museum partners to comfortably undertake this
    process.  Utilising the current
    partner infrastructures provides a model of federated searching which does not
    create a propriety system available to only a few, with large set-up and
    maintenance costs. Its provides a simple and straight-forward process which
    will enable other partners to join in the future and create a larger national,
    or even international, museum and gallery collection which is fully accessible
    to all. </p>
