        <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText"><i>ArtPad: A Collection. A Connection</i> has ambitious goals. At its core is the on-line presentation
    of works from the Glenbow Museum’s contemporary art collection, an exceptional
    collection that is not often presented to the public. Simple enough, but we
    also wanted to present the collection to an untapped audience for the museum:
    teenagers. Further, we strove to present the content in an educational context,
    yet in a way that high school art students would want to receive and interact
    with the artwork, with each other and with the museum. Ideally, this balance of
    (presented) museum content and Web 2.0 functionality will create user dialogues
    about the artwork featured and contemporary art in general, and user reactions
  to the art they can create and post on <i>ArtPad.</i>  </p>
<p class="AbstractText">The needs and preferences of the intended user were at
    the fore during development of ArtPad. Sample audience groups were consulted
    throughout the development process, and research was conducted on how this
  audience group learns and prefers to receive information. </p>
<p class="AbstractText">This paper will focus on the user evaluation process
    employed to develop the site, the features and components developed
    specifically for the target audience, and the Web 2.0 components used to create
    and build discussion around contemporary art practice. <i>ArtPad</i> dispenses with the traditional curatorial stance
    – that of one authoritative voice – and instead opens the discourse
  to users.</p>

<h1>ArtPad: Drawing Youth In</h1>
<p>When news moves slowly, the paper has time to provide
    perspectives, background, and interrelations for the news, and the reader is
    given a consumer package. When the news comes at a high speed, there is no
    possibility of such literary processing, and the reader is given a
  do-it-yourself kit. (McLuhan, 2003)</p>
<p>In 1959, Marshall McLuhan advised a thousand educators at a
    Chicago gathering sponsored by the American Association for Higher Education to
    dramatically change the educational system to give students the “perception and
    judgement” necessary to handle this fast-paced technological age. He insisted
    that educators should act much in the same way as industry: use consumer
    research to learn what motivates their students so they may become co-authors
    and co-producers, “that the new teaching must increasingly cast the student in
    co-teacher roles.” (McLuhan, 2003) Rather than being consumers of packaged
    information, students become motivated participants in their own learning,
  masters of the do-it-yourself kits.</p>
<p>ArtPad attempts to provide a do-it-yourself kit while giving
    students the necessary tools to process the information and make their own
    connections to contemporary art. Focus groups, user testing and literary
    reviews helped frame the site as a space that would respond to their needs and
    interests and visually engage students to learn and explore the myriad of
  issues, histories and stories offered by the selection of artworks.</p>
<p>The site is designed to allow users to engage with the
    artworks in an open-ended and active way. This approach embraces a more fluid
    relationship between art and audiences and frames art within a relational
    context. ArtPad users are invited to explore, analyze and transform the
  conditions under which they understand and appreciate the art they experience.</p>
<p>Our front-end testing revealed that students wanted all of
    the information about the work accessible, such as the motivation, the story,
    the meaning, how it was created and what the different media were, but they did
    not want to be inundated by copy. This was in line with our desire to create a
    space for a more self-directed approach to learning. We built the site with
    layers of information that would allow them to explore as many layers as they
  needed to understand the work or as their levels of interests would dictate.</p>
<p>Arthur C. Danto has written, “Ends of stories belong to
    stories, not to reality” (Danto, 1992),  meaning that there may be ends in our texts but not ends in
    our history. ArtPad embraces a fragmentary and causal way of connecting parts
    to a story that resists the static structure of a beginning, middle and end.
    ArtPad encourages users to explore further contextual information within the
    site as well as beyond to appreciate the complexity of each work. The site is
    designed in a way that allows users to approach the works from a number of
    different contexts. They can go directly to the gallery and select different
    artworks to explore, see all of the artworks on a timeline in relation to other
    world events, or see artists interviewed for more insight into their works. By
    not dictating a specific route, the site encourages a more independent and
    self-directed style of inquiry. There is no specific order to follow, only
  fragments and parts to explore and hopefully, connections to make. </p>
<h1>Teens, Contemporary Art and the Need for Evaluation </h1>
<p>I have often wondered how my generation will be remembered
    and be identified and whether people will even care in 50 years. I’ve spent a
    lot of time thinking of some common bond that we all share, some new trend or
    cultural change that we pioneered. I couldn’t think of anything that my
    generation would be known for, so I popped in my earphones, played a relaxing
    song on my iPod and Googled the answer while I texted my friend’s cell phone
    asking if he wanted to go to the new Wi-Fi coffee house to get a raspberry
    mocha flavored soy latte. That’s when it hit me: my generation will be known
    for having an abundance of absurd latte flavors! (<a href="http://digitallearning.macfound.org/">http://digitallearning.macfound.org</a>)
  (Mike L., an American teen )</p>
<p>ArtPad brings together two things many have difficulty
  understanding: teens and contemporary art. </p>
<p>Before further defining the ArtPad experience, we needed to
    know more about our target audience. A literature review revealed some
    encouraging external research on youth in the target age group: our target
    audience is more interested in ideas linked to objects than the objects alone
    (a good potential fit for contemporary art, which incorporates both idea and
  object) (Kelly and Bartlett, 2000).</p>
<p>This same study, although published pre Web 2.0, identified
    preferences youth have for traditional museum experiences that coincide with
    one of our goals: to incorporate two-way communication experiences on ArtPad. From
    here we could begin to envision ways youth might be able to interact with each
    other and with the site’s content. According to the research findings,  youth are preoccupied with three main
  things: </p>
<ul>
  <li>developing
    their sense of personal identity (not so much the nation’s identity)</li>
  <li>developing
    their relationships (sharing views with friends and partners); </li>
  <li>building
    on skills and talents (current works, techniques, advances and designs) (Kelly
    and Bartlett, 2000)</li>
</ul>
<p>From the Mouths of Teens…</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">“Why stick dresses in with bees? Like, how does a
    person decide to do that?” (ArtPad focus group member, responding to “The
  Officiator” by Aganetha Dyck).</p>
<p>The front-end evaluation conducted for <i>ArtPad</i> was by far the most useful evaluation we conducted
    for the Web site. Our approach was to use a mix of strategies. First was a
    questionnaire completed by individuals in the focus group. In these
    questionnaires users were asked about preferences for on-line resources and
  technologies and questioned regarding their on-line habits. </p>
<p>Two additional evaluation strategies elicited specific
    feedback about the artwork being featured, and corresponding user preferences.
    In order to find out what users would want to know about the art and how they
    would like to interact with it, we showed the focus group six images from the
    contemporary art collection. For these, the project curator provided some basic
    information about each work and the artist. We then asked the students what
    questions they had about the work. What more did they want to know? What didn’t
    they understand? After this round table question-and-answer session, the
    students wrote down additional questions they had (this accommodated students
  who may not have spoken up in the question-and-answer session).</p>
<p>Six additional images were then shown to the focus group, without
    any curatorial information. The students then responded to what they saw. Here
    we wanted to capture the questions students had when first seeing a work,
  without any context.</p>
<p>Our greatest learning from this exercise was the need for
    context. Not a great surprise, but the breadth and depth of that context did
    challenge our assumptions. For example, one of the works the students looked at
    was an installation entitled The King vs. Picariello. The title refers to a man
    named Picariello who was tried and hanged for the murder of a police officer in
    Alberta in the 1920s. Students in the focus groups wondered why or how a “king”
    figured into this. What king? Presumably not exposed to the legal system in
    school, the students did not understand this reference to the legal head of
    state, nor to the specific monarch, King George V. Picariello was a bootlegger
    during prohibition, which figures strongly into the story, but students also
  had no knowledge of why alcohol was illegal. </p>
<p>Upon seeing the work and hearing more about it, the
    students’ first reaction was often to titles. Titles of works can seem literal
    but are not; they can give the illusion of insight but provide none. The title
    of a sculpture by artist Eric Cameron naturally raised many questions. In
    Alice’s Rose, the viewer does not see an actual rose, but rather layers of
    gesso covering a rose. The focus groups wondered who Alice was and why the
    artist chose to cover a rose. They wondered why the sculpture was white and
    where the rose petals were. Finally, they wanted to understand why the artist
  created the work. </p>
<p>We established that the need for context was necessary, but
    we had to find a balance between providing context and giving information in a
    format and language that was not intimidating. Therefore content on the site
    was kept short and focused and was written and edited for the target audience.
    We also used a heading system for copy, so the copy was hidden until you
    clicked on the heading. That way the user was not visually inundated with reams
  of copy upon looking at a page. </p>
<p>It’s important to note that although we wanted to provide
    context, we did not want to provide definitive readings of the work. Rather,
    our aim was to provide users with enough information so they could read or
  engage with the work on another level, if they chose to do so.  </p>
<p>A timeline that provides a linear and more contextual way to
    experience the work was developed to allow users to explore the social
    realities around the production of each work. We decided not to limit the
    timeline only to art-related events because we wanted to demonstrate that art
    is steeped in the lived realities of its producers. We included references from
    every aspect of the contemporary culture: literature, politics, science, music,
    media, as well as the visual arts. The art of the 60s was influenced by a more
    open attitude, and artists no longer felt restricted to one particular style. But
    it was also a time where political activism questioned the limited definitions
    of gender, culture and race. To illustrate this, we highlighted events such as
    the First Nations vote in Canada in 1960; the Royal Commission on the Status of
    Women in 1967 investigating the living conditions of women in Canada; and the
    takeover of Alcatraz by Native American students in 1969. These events are
    placed in the timeline alongside historical art events such as the introduction
    of Pop Art which changed people’s expectations about what art had to look like,
    and the formation of the art collective General Idea in 1969 who were
    considered the pioneers of Conceptual Art in Canada. We wanted to demonstrate
    that all of the different and unrelated events created a social climate that had
    a huge impact on what artists produced. Jack Shadbolt’s Northern Emblem #21 is
    a response to a fiery debate around Canada’s adoption of a new flag, but also
  reflects tensions in the artist’s artistic vision.</p>
<p>At the end of our focus group session, members of the
    project team sat down with small groups of students at computers and asked  the students to show their favourite Web
    sites and tell us why they liked them. This was a better strategy than simply
    asking them this question on a survey (show me versus tell me). From
    CalgaryFlames.com to MySpace to MetaCafe to Deviantart.com, a consistent theme
    emerged: students wanted to contribute their own content and interact with
  others around like topics. </p>
<p>Other key findings also emerged from this session and
    influenced our design for ArtPad. Students were not familiar with some of the
    media types on the site, such as installations and collages. So a glossary of
    art terms was added where definitions of media types and other terminology were
    provided. These terms help users to navigate through the myriad of styles,
    movements, techniques and concepts that could be daunting otherwise. Through
    various ways, the site helps users learn about the issues, concerns and ideas
    contemporary artists explore, the various materials and approaches to artmaking
    and the numerous ways one can come to understand and find meaning in a work of
  art.</p>
<p>Contemporary art utilizes a variety of styles, genres and
    media. Because of this, familiarity with how the work was created can be
    important to its understanding. In addition, students were not familiar with
    some of the processes and simply required an explanation of this. So for each
    work of art in the Gallery, there is a category called How Was This Made? Here
    the materials and processes involved in creating each work are identified.
    Having access to that knowledge is empowering. At the same time, it reminds us
    that the process, the skill and the labour are just as important as the end
  result, and sometimes even more interesting than the final product</p>
<p>Our work is so specialized that we tend to forget that art
    may seem to have little relevance to others outside of our field. By
    demystifying some of the language and key concepts, we can nurture a sense of
    belonging and ownership that may encourage a desire to engage in, participate
    with or perhaps, re-write the presented ideas. ArtPad recognizes not only that
    we all respond to art in different ways, but also that we need certain tools in
    order to have a starting point. The Looking at this Work section attempts to
    provide some entry points into the work by asking some formal questions about
    each piece to activate a more critical gaze. The questions help users to consider
    juxtapositions, patterns, incongruities, and their own physical and emotional
    experience with the work and its associated ideas. For example, Harry Kiyooka’s
    The Agean #6, a pale blue square with classical architectural detailing around
    the edges, requires more context, more time and a questioning of one’s
    experience of the work to appreciate. Some of the questions invite users to
    explore how the shapes and colours play with our perceptions of space and their
  personal experience of the sea.</p>
<p>Students wanted more information on the story or meaning
    behind the work. We knew from our evaluation that we could not simply present
    the works and expect the students to derive their own meaning or understanding just
    by looking at the work. Curatorial comments on each work are offered as
    interpretive responses under the subheading Finding Meaning and are offset by the
    Insight from the Artist section, which affords the artists some control in the
    way their works are discussed or interpreted. For instance, with Eric Cameron’s
    work, Alice’s Rose, a rose engulfed in thousands of layers of gesso and acrylic
    paint, the curatorial statement focuses more on Cameron’s rigorous process
    which seems to conflict with the organic and fluid nature of the resulting form.
    This is a nice contrast to the artist’s insight into the work describing the
    narratives behind the work, such as how he came to paint a red rose with white
    paint, its reference to the Wars of the Roses, as well as to the passage in
    Alice in Wonderland where the gardeners were ordered by the Queen to paint the
    white roses red. Cameron’s comments insert  elements of humour and personal history that are key in the
    reception of the work, which at first glance may seem a bit alien and
  inaccessible. </p>
<p>Visual access to the images was important to our users.
    Students wanted to see images up close and established the need to understand
    the size of the works in real life. And for three-dimensional works, the need
    to see the work in the round was identified. To address this we added a zoom
    feature for each work so students can see the work close-up. We videotaped all
    three-dimensional works so the users can play a short video that shows the work
    from all points of view, and we added a scale visual for each work so users can
    get a better sense of the size of the artwork. (In one case, we replaced an
    artwork with another by the same artist because the original work could not be
  truly appreciated in a flat, two-dimensional form on the Web.) </p>
<p>Art is not merely a visual or textual representation of
    ideas; its meaning arises from its  engagement with the everyday, with its audience and its
    social context. The ability to relate art to the context of the users is an
    integral part of the curatorial approach. To this end, we invited a group of
    high school students (our target audience) to conduct video interviews (in
    focus group testing, students identified video and audio as two preferred modes
    of receiving information) with five artists from the site: Chris Cran, Ryan
    Sluggett, Katie Ohe, Greg Payce and Jane Ash Poitras. Groups of two to three
    students were assigned an artist to research. To ensure that the content would
    be relevant to their own interests, they had to formulate the questions about
    the work and then conduct the interviews themselves. This process provided
  students an active role in the production of content.  </p>
<p>We also created an audio-based activity called The Players
    where students can learn more about the art world and the different people
    involved by listening to conservators, curators, dealers and artists talk about
    five works of art featured on the site. The Players serves to demystify the art
    world and helps to demonstrate how different individuals can add or change the
    meaning of a work of art. This section features four different perspectives on
    a single work of art. Through audio interviews, this section examines in detail
    the five works of art from the perspectives of four “players” in the art field
    - the artist, a conservator, a curator and an art dealer. The responses from
    each “player” demonstrate the various ways one can see and appreciate art. A
    conservator describes a work of art differently than the artist does because
    the conservator is interested in the preservation and longevity of the
    materials, how different materials relate to each other and the long-term
    storage implications the piece may have. The artist may not be as interested in
    those matters, but will describe the work much more conceptually. Each “player”
    is also asked to respond to the work on a personal level;  unexpected answers brought new and less
    obvious meanings to the work. Our paper conservator, Lee Churchill, when asked
    about the challenges to Linh Ly’s photo-tapestry Our Vietnamese Restaurants,
    focuses on the instability of the dyes in the photos and the fragility of the
    work overall. However, when asked to respond to the work on a personal level,
    the mixed media combination of canvas and photography, once an “inherent vice”,
   becomes a point of interest to the
    work visually, highlighting the often paradoxical relationship between art and
  preservation.</p>
<h1>Connecting to the Curriculum </h1>
<p class="BlockQuote">World’s a different place. No longer a need to teach kids
    how to learn about Hopi indians, because you can Google it...but there is a
    desperate need to teach kids how to think critically… (<a href="http://www.reemer.com/">http://www.reemer.com</a>)  <br/>
  – Vinod Khosla, Founding CEO of Sun Microsystems)</p>
<p>A member of our project team was a high school art teacher
    who also specializes in teaching art via distance education. She created the
    teacher resources for the site and was involved with the team in the site
    conceptualization process. Early in the process, we identified inquiry-based
    learning as the educational approach we wanted for ArtPad.  Inquiry-based learning is a
    student-centered and student-led process. The purpose is to engage the students
    in active learning, ideally based on their own questions. Each question leads
    to the creation of new ideas and other questions. It is directly evident in the
    teacher resources and in features like Good Question (a list of questions or
    starting points of inquiry on the site). But it’s also evident in the Finding
    Meaning questions on the site that prompt further thought and discussion, and
    in the many connections within the site (and externally) that extend the point
  of inquiry.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with developing ArtPad for a high
    school audience was the high school art curriculum in Alberta. There is nothing
    in the curriculum that speaks directly to contemporary art practice. Because
    the curriculum is vague in its approach, it was difficult to make direct
    connections between our resource and the curriculum, a common best practice
    when developing any resource for educational purposes. So we focused instead on
    the curriculum outcomes related to understanding and discussing art critically,
    and directed much of our development efforts to demystifying contemporary art
  by helping the target audience</p>
<ul>
  <li>learn
    about issues, concerns, style and ideas that contemporary artists explore;</li>
  <li>learn
    about the different ways art can be made – materials and processes; </li>
  <li>learn
    the visual language so they have tools to critique and interpret art; and</li>
  <li>learn
    how to view art and understand how the viewer adds to the meaning of the work.</li>
</ul>
<h1>An Outlet and a Meeting Ground</h1>
<p class="blockQuote">Caught up in a quest for identity, teens are looking for
    ways to define who they are. They are working out a persona they can settle
    into and present to others. On-line spaces can be very useful in helping them
    attain this goal. Some Web sites are outlets for individual self-expression
  while others are meeting grounds of like-minded peers (<a href="http://www.pbs.org/">http://www.pbs.org</a>  PBS parents’ Web site). </p>
<p>ArtPad aspires to be both an outlet for individual
    self-expression and a meeting ground of like-minded peers. When we began the
    ArtPad project, we had two known perameters: that the project would showcase
    Canadian and (primarily) Western Canadian contemporary artworks from the
    Glenbow’s art collection, and that we had to include at least two, two-way
    communication interfaces. Both of these were contingent on our federal
  government grant. </p>
<p>Through various modes of engagement, users are introduced to
    contemporary Canadian art in a way that moves away from hierarchies that often
    dictate the way information is presented and received. Glenbow’s contemporary
    art collection is highlighted in a way that recognizes its diversity. The
    selection of works spans a 40-year period and range in subject matter, media,
    and style. The artists featured reflect a diverse mix of issues and ideas and
    reflect different generational, gender, ethnic and personal histories. The
    scope of this collection can open up various discussions about a wide range of
    issues and ideas. The Talk Back, Ask the Curator and The Studio (where they can
    create their own artworks) are features where students can respond to the
    content, issues and ideas with their own opinions, questions or personal  creations. As well, there are links to
    additional sources beyond the site so they can further explore contemporary art
    or specific issues that strike their interest. These features not only give the
    students a forum but also show that the content and the site are not static and
  that engagement with art should be a dialogue.</p>
<p>In TalkBack, the two-way communication feature, students
    have an opportunity to express their opinions about the works and engage in
    dialogue with other users. (This function is moderated.) However, during site
    development we realized that it wasn’t enough to simply include an opportunity
    to add content to the Talkback feature. How could we ensure the content in this
    feature was more than a series of “This sucks” and “Wow, that’s cool?” So the
    content team created questions to prompt discussion within the TalkBack
    section. Formative evaluation further reinforced this requirement. Because many
    of the students had limited exposure to contemporary art, their ability to
    discuss it with each other would require more than an open invitation to
    contribute any comment whatsoever. For Alan Dunning’s Einstein’s Brain we added
    this question: “Have you ever looked at something that reminded you of
    something else?” And for Eric Cameron’s Alice’s Rose we prompted discussion
    with this question: “In this work, Cameron covered a rose with layers of paint
    and gesso. What object would you cover in the same manner? What final shape do
  you think it would take?”</p>
<p>When asked what would make them come back to a site that
    featured contemporary art, students singled out the user-generated content
    features: the Talkback feature, My Opinion, and Ask the Curator sections.
    Students also said that they would stay on the site if they could make their
    own contemporary art. In development we struggled with what kind of artmaking
    activity we could create on-line that would be authentic and not replicate
    software that already existed (i.e. a “Paint” program). We needed an activity
    that was within project scope, yet gave users enough choice and control in
    their experience that it was meaningful. The end result is The Studio, an on-line
    artmaking activity. Students can choose between two media types (installation
    or mixed media sculpture) – media types we knew the students were not as
    familiar with. Here they could experiment, explore and work with art forms they
    may not have utilized in the past. In creating  The Studio, we also had the advantage of working with four
    post-secondary students from the Alberta College of Art and Design. Their input
    in terms of issues users could explore or respond to in this activity was
    invaluable as they were closer in age to the target audience than our
    development team was. They also aided in the creation of the interface design
    and choice of assets for this activity, again ensuring that we were developing
    an activity that our target audience would respond to on a multitude of
  levels.  </p>
<p>In <em>The Elsewhere Community</em>, the 1997 CBC Massey Lectures,
    Hugh Kenner explores the Western fascination with traveling abroad for new
    experiences, from the Grand Tour where the eighteenth century British upper
    class, mostly young men, travelled across Europe before settling on a career,
    to the age of the Internet where encounters with new people planet-wide can be
    made from your computer screen. While the computer allows you to be the
    “invisible tourist,” it is an experience that is greatly limited. “Full two-way
    interaction – person-to-person/in-person is something tourism makes
    possible.” (Kenner, 1998.) He advocates for an Elsewhere Community that
    combines both virtual and physical presence. ArtPad is an on-line experience
    that seeks to engage teenagers with contemporary art so they may also find
    themselves at the museum doors to experience the art in person, at an art
    college to become artists themselves, curating exhibitions or buying art from a
    local gallery. ArtPad seeks to draw students in and help them process
    contemporary art from their own perspectives, but it also seeks to build an
  audience for contemporary art for both virtual and physical communities.</p>
