        <p class="AbstractText">A great variety of Web sites displaying cultural aspects
  of landscapes exist today. Although built on different design patterns, all
  these Web sites have to cope with the typical problem of creating a concise but
  comprehensive representation of a variety of cultural resources within a
  framework of time and space. In this paper we discuss currently predominant but
  very different approaches, ranging from an historical GIS and a wiki with
  Google maps to illustrated HTML-documents and Flash-based visual narratives. We
  propose a model that identifies generic requirements for spatiotemporal
  cultural heritage Web sites. The model helps to understand how well different
  implementation environments suit various objectives. The model is applied to
  our own cultural landscape portal on the region around the Vecht, a small river
  which runs from the city of Utrecht to the north, at both sides fringed by a
  rich historical landscape.</p>

<h1>Cultural Landscapes </h1>
<p>A <i>cultural
  landscape</i> is the product of
  both the activity of nature and human intervention. It includes historical
  places, buildings, and other cultural markers, together with the natural
  environment itself; by the impact of human habitation it has got cultural value
  as well (Breure <i>et al</i>.,
  2006). Such a landscape can be considered as a ‘museum without walls’.</p>
<p>In 1992 UNESCO’s
  World Heritage Committee defined three categories of cultural landscapes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Clearly defined landscapes designed and created
    intentionally by man; for example, gardens and parks constructed for aesthetic
    reasons.</li>
  <li>Organically evolved landscapes reflecting the
    historical process of evolution. They fall into two subcategories:
    <ol class="list-letters">
      <li>a relict (or fossil)
        landscape in which an evolutionary process came to an end at some time in the
        past, having significant features still visible in material form.</li>
      <li>a continuing landscape in
        which the evolutionary process is still in progress, at the same time
        exhibiting significant material evidence of its evolution over time.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>    Associative cultural landscapes, areas with powerful religious, artistic or
    cultural associations rather than material cultural evidence (Rössler, 2003).</li>
</ol>
<p>This paper focuses
  on category 2b, the landscape with historical value still retaining an active
  role in society. This category has some inherent information problems. </p>
<h1>Cultural Landscape Portals And Their Information Problems</h1>
<p>For centuries
  different groups of people have cultivated their environment. Traces of these
  activities are deposited in the landscape or have been scattered over various
  collection holders, like museums, archives, libraries, research institutes,
  government agencies - even far outside the cultural landscape itself. This is
  documented by a great variety of spatiotemporal cultural heritage Web sites
  which we subsume under the general notion of <i>cultural landscape portals</i>.</p>
<p>Each of them deals
  with specific aspects of cultural landscapes, often aiming at a particular
  purpose that sometimes even lies far beyond the regional scope of the landscape
  itself. A holistic view, however, seems more appropriate to show the role of a
  cultural landscape in an actively changing society. Tourism, spatial planning
  and initiatives to strengthen awareness of regional identity may benefit from
  an integrated approach. In the Dutch context, for example, decisions on a
  prominent issue like regional water management require integration of
  information from many sources and are related to a wide range of issues: land
  use, preservation of natural environment, cultural heritage, national versus
  regional spatial planning, and so on. </p>
<p>The target audience
  of these portals is a fleeting group of tourists, schoolchildren, students,
  architects, town and country planners, governmental administrators and the
  local population, who do not want to spend hours studying scattered sources and
  distilling the information they need. These users rather prefer ‘one-window
  shopping’ and information packages whose essence can be quickly grasped.
  Instead of long-winded stories, explorative interfaces should be offered, empowering
  users to integrate information to their own taste and from different Web sites
  in a transparent way.</p>
<p>Many cultural
  landscape portals came into existence as database-driven projects and still
  present themselves as structured collections of individual items. Users with
  limited, factual questions will be satisfied with searching information about a
  specific location or object. A landscape portal is then the specialized entry
  point. </p>
<p>However, information
  integration requires more. Ideally, one must be able to read” the landscape in
  its spatiotemporal context (Birnbaum, 1994; Taylor; 2003; Scazzosi, 2004;
  Breure et al., 2006). This implies building relations between points in time
  and space in order to create cause-and-effect-trajectories. This reading will
  take place on different levels: landscape as nature, habitat, artifact, system,
  problem, wealth, ideology, history, place and aesthetic. Integration (and
  understanding) may still require a lot of study in spite of all the information
  available on the Web.</p>
<p>To support this
  reading process, a cultural landscape portal can help users to find and
  integrate the variety of scattered information. It may not only provide data,
  but also explain the landscape’s development. This requires an overview of the
  area’s full extent, with its infrastructure, vegetation and land use, and a
  more detailed display of objects and historical locations, in their present
  state as well as in the previous or future stages. All of these can be linked
  together by a representation of the processes that underlie the landscape’s
  changes over time (Breure et al., 2006). Technically, this means an integration
  of different multimedia objects, including texts, (aerial) photographs,
  historical and modern maps, and video.</p>
<p>This brief sketch
  leaves us with some thorny questions about content engineering and portal
  design. Although reflecting different design patterns, all cultural landscape
  portals have to cope with the problem of creating a comprehensive yet concise
  representation of a variety of cultural resources within a framework of time
  and space. Are there any best practices for creating such an integrative view
  on a cultural landscape, leaving ample room for detailed exploration too? What
  kinds of design patterns and techniques have proven to be most successful? How
  are they to be translated to the portal’s architecture? In other words, can we
  define some architectural principles that solve the typical information
  problems of cultural landscape portals? </p>
<h1>A Model For An Integrative Presentation Of Cultural Landscapes</h1>
<h2>A Theoretical Framework: Building On The Legacy Of The <i>Annales</i></h2>
<p>In search of a
  suitable portal architecture, we may learn from existing Web sites. How well do
  they succeed in presenting an integrated view of their collection? Although we
  already implied what we mean by integrating cultural landscape information, the
  notion should be more well-founded before starting any analysis of existing
  portals.</p>
<p>The landscape as
  substratum of historical discourse is not new. About the middle of the previous
  century the idea was taken to a higher level by the French <i>Annales</i> school of history. In 1949 the monumental work
  by Fernand Braudel, <i>The Mediterranean,</i> was published (French title: <i>La Méditerranée et le monde
  méditerranéen à l’époque de Philippe II – </i>revised in 1966; Braudel, 1966). It comprised
  much more than a detailed study of the Mediterranean as a cultural landscape:
  it demonstrated also a theoretical model of geohistory, or, rather a ‘total
  history’ (<i>histoire globale</i>)
  based on geographic structures and differences in historical time. </p>
<p>The work starts from
  the premise that human society develops at different rhythms and that all the
  elements within any human situation interact with one another. There are three
  levels of historic time, or three lenses,” for observing the past:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>longue durée</i> is a perspective that concentrates on the
    immobile, the steady patterns of life with its underlying geographical
    constraints and natural regulating mechanisms related to climate, seasons and
    social conventions.</li>
  <li>The <i>moyenne durée </i>(or <i>conjonctures</i>) is about historical processes that develop in
    cycles like the rise of a trade center. Its time span is about fifty  to one
    hundred years.</li>
  <li>The <i>courte durée </i>(or <i>histoire</i> <i>événementielle</i>) deals with the short-term events in history
    and their consequences, like warfare, political actors, earthquakes, famines,
    diseases (Hufton, 1986).</li>
</ul>
<p>In spite of
  criticism and revisiting (Clark, 1999; Lai, 2004), Braudel’s ideas are still
  influential in cultural landscape studies (Barker, 1995; Westerdahl, 1998;
  Ucko, 1999), not surprisingly because of his integrative approach with emphasis
  on overview. Maritime archeology, for example, coined the term ‘maritime <i>durée</i>’ to refer to the long-term interaction between
  humans and the maritime coastal landscape (Rönnby, 2007). Viewed through the
  lens of the <i>Annales</i>, the
  dynamic change between centralization and decentralization in the Maya state
  was explained as a classic example of the contradictions between a long-term
  structure (kinship) and medium-term (kingship) cycle” (Iannone, 2002).</p>
<p>Likewise inspired by
  Braudel’s intellectual legacy, we introduce here a simple model that will help
  to define the notion of information integration with regard to a cultural
  landscape. It should not be considered as a working out of Braudel&#39;s theory,
  but rather as a practical frame of reference that employs the idea of different
  historical rhythms. Upon a basis formed by the dimensions of time and space we
  propose three layers:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Structures (in a Braudelian sense): geological,
    geographical, climatological, but also fundamental, stable political and legal
    structures.</li>
  <li>Processes: a catch-all term for all those
    longer-time-related human activities and/or gradual changes in the natural
    environment that formed distinctive stages of the cultural landscape, like the
    historical peat extraction causing today’s problems of water management in
    several Dutch regions.</li>
  <li>Events concerning objects and locations
    relevant to the landscape’s history and/or natural development. They have in
    common that they take up relatively little time or space. Information on this
    level includes not only the event itself, but also its material cultural
    evidence; e.g. it contains the fact of building a castle as well as a
    description of what was built. </li>
</ol>
<p>To symbolize the
  differences in rhythm, we may visualize the layers in a pyramid shape, like in
  figure 1. With the help of this model, a portal for cultural landscapes can be
  characterized by roughly mapping its content on to these levels with some indication
  of its extent in time and space. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Breure.fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="241"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 1: A reference model for cultural landscapes</p>
<h1>Defining Information Integration</h1>
<p>The portal’s content
  will consist of well-organized chunks of information, or topics. A <i>topic</i> in its simplest form can be represented by a
  short text; however, a cluster of related texts, images, maps, diagrams, etc.
  will occur much more frequently. In a database-driven system, a topic coincides
  with a view (snapshot), a particular selection of data.</p>
<p>Against the
  background of the reference model, information integration can be bound to two
  principles:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b><i>A topic should extend over multiple
    dimensions</i></b>. In terms of
    figure 1, a topic should not be a ‘circle in a plane’, for example, a factual
    account of events without integrating related processes and structures; also a
    ‘wall’ or a ‘pillar’ is an undesirable shape, which would imply a historical
    narrative covering a small time slice, and/or tiny territory. Although
    publications on such limited topics have their own value, for example in local
    history, they do not contribute to an integrative view on the cultural
    landscape as a whole. The ideal shape is a ‘sphere’, a topic that has a
    balanced integration of various historical levels over a reasonable distance in
    time and space. In practice we will find, of course, much less ideal shapes.</li>
  <li><b><i>Topics should be connected through
    content, not only by hyperlinks</i></b>.
    Although hyper linking topics is a major step towards integration, users may
    perceive the shift from one document to an other as an abrupt change. They have
    to pick up the story line each time a new document is opened. This can be cured
    by deliberately dividing a topic into two parts, core and context information.
    The latter will cover related topics in a global or fragmentary way depending
    on the subject. </li>
</ol>
<p>Principle 1 will
  automatically encourage a more panoramic style of writing and displaying, in
  which other topics appear on the horizon. However, contextual connections need
  not necessarily be made in the text itself. There are many more options to
  implement this principle; for example, through an interactive map that keeps
  one part (the overview) static, while another part changes, e.g. through a
  pop-up window. An interactive timeline (with more information than just names)
  can also function as a connector and can be used in the contextual part of
  several related topics. A well-chosen image will also connect different
  stories, as with the old school wall pictures about farm life or meadow birds
  which implicitly provide context to the individual objects displayed. </p>
<p>Hyperlinks, or any
  substitute in the form of buttons, clickable maps etc., are still required, but
  they are always embedded within a content that provides a sort of preview of
  the topic linked to. This will result in interesting graphical page navigators
  which replace a simple list of page titles.</p>
<p>To summarize both
  principles visually: in our definition a highly integrated presentation looks
  like Figure 2. Topics are ideally spheres intersecting one another, rather than
  balls connected with lines (which represent hyperlinking only). The connector
  is either the intersection itself (i.e. shared content), or the ball in the
  middle (binding contextual content). In addition, these spheres should
  intersect more than one layer, thus combining different levels of history. </p>
<p>However, information
  integration thus defined lacks the important quality of overview or filtering.
  This is not so much a feature of the content structure itself, but rather a
  quality of the presentation. It is also highly related to information
  requirements, which will vary by target audience, and therefore are a rather
  subjective criterion. Referring to Figure 2, we may say at least that the user
  should not perceive the portal’s content merely as a multitude of topics.
  Ideally, users can follow one or more story lines through an information
  hierarchy formed by connected topics. In our discussion of portals below, this
  aspect is not rated, since it requires profound and detailed usability
  analysis.</p>

<h1>Examples Of Cultural Landscape Portals Regarding Information Integration</h1>
<p><i>(See the section
  References for the URLs of the Web sites cited below.) </i></p>
<h2>I: Collection Portals </h2>
<p>A large group of
  cultural landscape portals are based on physical collections of cultural
  heritage institutions, which vary from museums, libraries, archives to
  projects, mostly of regional or supraregional character, and which present
  material from different collection holders.</p>
<h3>Historical Map Collections</h3>
<p>Collections of
  historical maps form an important category in this group and are sometimes the
  outstanding representation of cultural landscapes, like in <i>American Memory</i>. There, cultural landscapes are documented by
  digitized maps viewable through a zooming and navigation mechanism, presented
  completely with metadata. This is a recurrent pattern, also used by many
  libraries for their map collections. This type of Web site aims primarily at
  presenting collections and is not intended as a real cultural landscape portal.
  The degree of integration is usually low – in terms of our model, it does
  not go beyond ‘circles in the plane of structures’. Of course, maps may also
  document historical processes and events, but when presented individually, as
  static images, one can only see how structures have changed over time, perhaps
  after printing the maps first. The process itself must be reconstructed by the
  user himself.</p>
<p>A larger integration
  of map information on the level of structures can be realized by georeferencing
  maps and by search options using a gazetteer. The <i>Royal Tropical Institute</i> in the Netherlands has brought a substantial
  collection of colonial maps on-line (Indonesia, Suriname and the Netherlands
  Antilles); they can be searched by  geographical names. Hits are circled on the
  historical map and can be marked also on Google Earth.</p>
<h3>Mixed Collections</h3>
<p>Maps may be part of
  mixed digital collections which include also material like photographs, art
  reproductions and written documents. This type of portal distinguishes itself
  from the previous category by its heterogeneous character, but has the same
  focus on collections, mainly resulting in an equally low degree of integration.
  A good example is <i>Digital Himalaya</i>,
  which includes also journals, films, music, photos, texts and census data.</p>
<p>Another
  representative of this genre is the <i>Japanese Historical Map Collection</i>, housed on the Berkeley campus in the East
  Asian Library. The on-line version is related to the David Rumsey Collection
  and counts over 1100 images of maps and books.</p>
<p>In terms of our
  model, this type of portal covers all levels of history, but the topics are
  quite small, granules rather than balls, without connections other than
  metadata.</p>
<h2>ll: Reference Portals</h2>
<p>We understand by
  reference portals those Web sites whose main purpose is to collect and share
  information from different sources, and to organize and present it in a certain
  format; for example, as a database or a wiki or through a geographic
  information system (GIS). As with conventional reference works like an atlas or
  encyclopedia, the emphasis is on creating knowledge rather than on displaying
  collections. </p>
<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>Professional
  information about cultural landscapes is systematically organized in <b>(text)
  databases like</b> the <i>World
  Heritage Site</i> of UNESCO and <i>Cultbase</i>, created by PAN, a thematic network on
  cultural landscapes and their ecosystems. A survey of these institutional
  expert databases is far beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
<p><b>Digital libraries</b> form a special subcategory; they can also be
  classified as mixed collections. They contain a wide range of historical
  sources, both visual material and texts. Most well-known is <i>Perseus</i>, which covers not only antiquity, but also,
  amongst other topics, the history of London from its founding to the 19th
  century. Another nice example is the <i>Tibetan and Himalayan Digital Library</i>. It contains a variety of cultural resources,
  like images, audio/video, interactive maps, a GIS, and a gazetteer which is
  connected with an interactive map. However, viewing a QuickTime-panorama from 
  Mount Everest, it is impossible to switch to a map or GIS to locate the
  position.</p>
<p>Integration will
  vary: a lot of content is very well linked, but in other cases isolated
  documents are displayed and users must find their way to neighboring
  information on their own. Like mixed collections, these portals cover all
  historical levels.</p>
<h3>Wikis</h3>
<p>Following
  Wikipedia’s popular model, some Web sites sprang into existence and tried to
  get non-professionals involved. Germany has a <i>Germaniki</i> with information about German cities and
  towns, and the <i>Kulturlandschaftsportals Thüringen</i> makes an appeal to local populations to
  participate in a research project on the cultural landscape and to share their
  local expertise through a wiki. The south-western part of the Netherlands is
  being documented in the <i>Buurtatlas</i> (‘neighborhood atlas’), which combines a wiki with Google maps.</p>
<p>With regard to our
  reference model, the wikis mentioned tend to focus on the level of events.
  Because automatic linking is part of the wiki model, one can easily switch
  topics, but the built-in collaborative mechanisms do not direct the users
  towards an integrated presentation of content. Because the usage of a wiki
  implies a great number of authors, a balanced contextual overlap between topics
  is hard to realize. </p>
<h3>GIS</h3>
<p>We use the term
  ‘geographic information system’ (GIS) in the broad sense of the word, as an
  information system that handles locationally defined data, not necessarily
  having possibilities for extensive data analysis. Therefore, software like
  Google Earth and Google Maps also falls under this definition. </p>
<p>Google software
  makes it quite easy to mark cultural data on a map; for example, archeological
  excavations, as the Belgian Web site <i>OpGraven</i> does. The award-winning Flemish cultural
  heritage site <i>Erfgoed in Vlaanderen</i> combines Google Map technology with Flickr, where pictures are grouped and made
  accessible through various entries.</p>
<p>Because many
  professional landscape organizations, government agencies and research groups
  tend to create their own GIS to visualize administrative data, it is unfeasible
  to give a representative sketch of the full range of applications. We shall
  concentrate, for our purpose, on the most important subcategory: <i>historical
  GIS</i>, which uses
  geovisualization as a common framework to integrate spatially referenced data,
  mainly from serial historical sources. Historical maps can be used as 
  (semi-transparent) overlays to combine different views of a landscape over
  time.</p>
<p>A historical GIS is
  used for three purposes: </p>
<ol>
  <li>to empirically research the history of land use
    in relation to human settlement and economic change, </li>
  <li>to visualize past landscapes, and </li>
  <li>to make historical-geographical source
    materials available to scholars and to the general public (Knowles, 2005). In
    the Netherlands, <i>HISGIS</i> documents the history of the northern province of Friesland in this way.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <i>Electronic
  Cultural Atlas Initiative</i> (ECAI) is a good starting point for an overview of this subcategory. Many of
  the projects listed are powered by the open source package <i>TimeMap</i>, which allows integration of diverse data
  resources into a unified structure by defining a conceptual mapping between a
  spatiotemporal data model and the project data. Maps with timelines and
  controls are displayed through a Java applet. Areas are made clickable and
  linkable to any Web resource. Historical processes can be visualized through
  animations created on the fly, provided the underlying data are suitable for
  display on a map. </p>
<p><i>ECAI Iraq</i> is an illustration of what can be realized
  with TimeMap. Data about the Iraqi and Mesopotamian culture is stored in
  hundreds of Web sites around the world. ECAI Iraq acts as a central access
  point using time-enabled thematic maps. The time line displays for each period
  a list of links to Web resources. The interactive maps show the different
  empires which can be switched on/off, or filtered through a time scale slider.
  The Web site provides multiple entry points, like a map index and a list plus
  clickable map of historical sites and empires.</p>
<p>Given the
  predominant combination of maps and database data, one misses sometimes an
  explanatory historical narrative. An exception in this respect is <i>A Vision
  of Britain</i>, created by the
  Great Britain Historical GIS Project. After selection of a location and a
  theme, the statistical data are introduced by a short text. The site contains
  also historical maps and – a striking narrative element –
  travelers’ tales linked to locations.</p>
<p>The historical GIS
  approach has powerful integrative capabilities, in particular with regard to
  our first principle: a GIS can cover all levels of history and provide an
  integrated view through a combination of maps, animations, and statistical
  charts. Its limitation lies with the second principle, that of connecting
  through content. Integration is fully dependent on the content’s spatial
  characteristics. A map is the only connector between topics, which are, in this
  context, views or snapshots. </p>
<h2>lll: Gateway Portals</h2>
<p>Although ‘gateway’
  is often used as a synonym of ‘portal’, we want to reserve this term for
  introductory portals with emphasis on educational and promotional purposes.
  Many Web sites in this category are set up by collection holders or cultural
  heritage sites for the benefit of tourists, schools and the general public.</p>
<p>The low end
  distinguishes itself from typical tourist Web sites by the larger amount of
  background information supplied. A few examples chosen haphazardly are the
  French Web site about the Loire valley, <i>Val de Loire</i>, the gateway to the <i>Australian Alps
  National Parks</i>, and the <i>Jurassic
  Coast</i> Web site about the
  Dorset and East Devon sea side.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands,
  local museums and archives cooperate in Web showcases which display highlights
  of regional cultural heritage (for example, <i>Collectie Utrecht</i>). These Web sites tend to present historical
  processes as narratives composed of text and images, with links to collection
  elements. They have entries on themes, time periods and places, and interactive
  maps to facilitate selections. </p>
<p>A more media-rich
  variant is the on-line exhibitions which combine clickable maps, animation,
  video and audio to create a more immersive experience. Some fine examples are
  presented by the <i>Arctic Studies Center</i>. In <i>Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga</i> the concept of text-plus-images still
  dominates, but documents are enriched by audio and video, and are made
  accessible through clickable stops on a journey map.</p>
<p>The high end
  comprises the Flash-based visual narratives like those we may find in the
  portfolios of American studios, like <i>Terra Incognita</i> and <i>Second Story</i>. Here, the emphasis on multimedia and
  interactive experience is even stronger.</p>
<p>In <i>Congo Trek</i>, a co-production by Terra Incognita and
  National Geographic, one can hike with biologist Michael Fay across central
  Africa by moving a magnifier window over a digital map and by clicking places
  to read a dispatch from that location. Digital videos about forest life are
  held together by clickable 360<sup> </sup>degrees Shockwave panoramas.</p>
<p>In Second Story’s <i>Monticello</i> about the home of Thomas Jefferson, an
  integration of multimedia content is realized through a feature-filled
  interactive map of the plantation, a comprehensive database of images, and
  immersive 3D representations of the house (Johnson, 2005).</p>
<p>The category of
  gateway portals shows a sliding scale from hyperlinked illustrated texts to
  highly integrated multimedia presentations. A question presents itself: What
  role do multimedia techniques play with regard to information integration?
  Adding just more images, animations, or videos will not work. However,
  appropriate usage can strike the balance between comprehensiveness and
  conciseness. Where a hierarchy of hyperlinked texts becomes easily a burden, a
  varied mixture of multimedia views on the same subject may create a compelling
  experience. These views (topics, in terms of our model) can be connected by
  interactive images that function as visual skeletons.</p>
<h1>The Art Of Presentation</h1>
<h2>Rich Internet Applications</h2>
<p>Content integration
  itself does not yet guarantee a unified experience. The high end of gateway
  portals fall into the category of Rich Internet Applications (RIA). As Mullet
  (2003) has pointed out, RIA create seamless user experiences through immediate
  responses and smooth transitions between different states. They keep focus,
  presenting a complete story about a single subject without distracting
  information, and they are aware of user requirements through appropriate
  filtering. All this requires some heuristics for organizing the content presentation.
  This is also made clear by Terra Incognita and Second Story in their
  reflections on the experiential rich media applications they create (Marable,
  2000, 2004; Johnson 2003, 2005). Marable (2004) is most explicit with his
  Integrated On-line Exhibit Model. Formulated with on-line exhibitions in mind,
  it can be applied to cultural landscapes as well, as we demonstrate below. The
  model has three tiers:</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Experience</i>, a narrative-driven layer with emotionally engaging and
    entertaining elements.</li>
  <li><i>Exhibit</i>, the majority of interpretive and educational content in a
    mixture of linear and non-linear modes. Here, visitors can explore topics and
    themes.</li>
  <li><i>Research</i> (or archive), comprising the exhibition sources, like historical
    documents, works of art, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two
  additional key elements in the model: <i>multiple entry points</i>, which give different audiences access to the
  layer of content that best meets their needs, and <i>connecting story lines</i> encouraging visitors to follow a theme or
  topic between the layers.</p>
<h2>Enhancing The On-Line Exhibit Model</h2>
<p>In our own research
  project, the Cultural Landscape Explorer, we have experimented with integrating
  and presenting content along the lines described above. We have built an
  experimental portal <i>Venster op de Vecht </i>(http://www.vensteropdevecht.nl/), which covers the cultural
  landscape of the river Vecht, a small river in the Rhine-Meuse delta near
  Utrecht, with medieval castles and 17th and 18th century stately homes on its
  banks, and peat lands on both sides. The portal can be classified as a gateway
  and contains – on purpose – content with a varying degree of
  integration and a wide range of presentation modes; e.g. simple illustrated
  HTML documents connected by hyperlinks, an innovative guided tour based on
  Google Maps, as well as high-end visual narratives. Our findings show that
  cultural landscape content as described by our reference model (Figure 1) can
  be mapped also into the on-line exhibition model such as the one outlined
  above. </p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Events</i>: these, in particular their cultural
    evidences, form the points of interest which are suitable for attracting
    visitors’ attention. This is the experience level. One successful way of
    presentation is a flight over the landscape” as in our guided tour based on
    Google Maps (cf. also Terra Explorer: <a href="http://www.skylinesoft.com/">http://www.skylinesoft.com/</a>). Each stop
    has a popup balloon with pictures, and some have video fragments. A short text
    with hyperlinks refers to more detailed information elsewhere in the portal.
    Here, both the Google map and the balloon content act as connectors. Other
    entry points are map-linked slide shows with photos about a particular area.</li>
  <li><i>Processes</i>: it is tempting to visualize processes
    primarily through a thematic map or animations, as with a historical GIS.
    Initially, we did this, for example, with the interplay between land and water
    in the peat lands. However, it became clear that to be easily understood, this
    type of presentation required more text and pictures. The full presentation of
    a process will take elements from all three levels (events, processes,
    structures). In our case it evolved towards an on-line exhibit: text slides
    with pictures and historical maps combined with Flash-animations, mixing a
    linear story with explorative visuals. Connections are made through text that
    refers to other topics, and through clickable maps that act as skeletons to
    which other topics are linked. </li>
  <li><i>Structures</i>: the atlas, with both modern and historical
    maps, forms the archive section of our portal. Much of the material is still
    underutilized and is waiting to be better integrated with the process and event
    layers.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Helping users to
  read and to understand a cultural landscape requires more than just linked
  content; the content must be also self-integrated. The model we propose helps
  to illustrate why experiential Web applications with elements of both
  historical GIS and visual narratives provide best practices for supporting
  information integration. Based on quite different philosophies but both
  enabling exploration of underlying collections, historical GIS and visual
  narratives are complementary approaches which can very well be combined. So
  far, we have not found examples that did so on an extensive scale. Google Maps
  and interactive Flash maps are the light variants of geovisualization, and  can
  be added to portals of any type. But the effect of offering these techniques
  will be much greater when applied to a presentation that provokes visual and
  associative thinking. The content needs to be staged not in the linear way of a
  book, but in an explorative and multi-dimensional visual space. Such a
  presentation is highly applicable to portals of cultural landscapes. </p>
