        <p class="abstract">At Statens Museum for Kunst (SMK), the Danish national gallery, we wanted to reach a teenage audience. Our assumption was that if we truly wanted to engage this difficult - very elusive, ever changing, and perfidious - age group in dealing with art, we had to invite them to be active partners in creating this new initiative as well as in running it when launched. We wanted to let young people decode art for their peers. The result was a new art community on-site in the museum and on-line for teens age 12-20. We called it u.l.k. (in Danish u.l.k. is an abbreviation for Young Peoples&#39; Laboratories for Art). This paper evaluates the work done together with the teenagers, with a special focus on creating the Web site. The paper represents the outcomes of focus groups, interviews, usability tests, as well as log file analysis. We discuss what we’ve learned, how the community on the Web site has developed since the launch, and what our perspectives on the future are. </p>

    <h1>Making Room For Teenagers</h1>
      <p>For almost
        ten years SMK had worked successfully with children in The Children’s Museum of
        Art (primarily for 6-12 year olds) through exhibitions for children with original art, workshops, and
        special guided tours. But when the children became teenagers, SMK couldn’t hold
        on to them anymore – and visits from school classes with pupils of that
        age in the setting of The Children’s Museum of Art naturally made them feel
      dissatisfied. </p>
      <p>The Egmont Foundation
        in Denmark had originally funded the making of The Children’s Museum of Art,
        and they subsequently supported the new u.l.k. initiative with a large
        donation. The Egmont Knowledge Centre took shape, and today it includes The
        Children’s Museum of Art, u.l.k., a branch of The Danish National Art Library,
        and the study room for Prints and Drawings. We mention this background
        information to point out that the Museum in general went through many
      transformations during the time we had to develop the u.l.k. - from spring 2006 through to April 2007. </p>
      <p>To help us develop our new initiative, we collaborated
        with teachers, but what was most important to us was the engagement of 90 young
        people – known as artpilots – in the project. This represented a
        new way for us to work and provided for direct participation of our target
      audience in the planning and creation of the u.l.k.</p>
      <p>We’d made
        thorough preliminary studies to understand this new audience – asking the
        question: ”How does the world look from a teenager’s point of view”? One thing
        we realized at once was that it was very important to involve teens as much as
        possible and work closely with them. They worked with us in planning and
        executing every aspect of the project. They joined different working groups that
        helped to design the interior of the centre, to figure out how we should use
        digital media and the Web, to decide which theme we should work with during the
        first year, and to help us develop new educational activities relevant and
      interesting for teenagers. </p>

      <p> Artpilot
        Jesper is filming the conversation in order to be able to document new art
      knowledge constructed during the conversation.</p>
      <p>What’s been interesting is how much teens engaged in
        the project. It soon became all theirs; there was great team spirit, lots of
        enthusiasm, and a strong desire for independence. We learned from our
        evaluation that being part of u.l.k. made the artpilots feel stronger and more
        self-confident. Many of the artpilots and the young people using u.l.k. had the
        feeling that they were alone with their interest in the arts;  they felt shy about the artistic output
        they created, and very vulnerable. This new joined force of creative teenagers
      carried us with them by storm.</p>
      <h1>The Concept of u.l.k.
      (Young Peoples Laboratories for Art)</h1>
      <p>In the beginning we didn’t know what this new teenage
        initiative in The Egmont Knowledge Centre would turn out to be. As our work
        progressed, it became important to find it a name that would resonate with
        young people. The artpilots had many very good ideas, and it was a difficult
        task to find a name that explained what the initiative was about while
      satisfying the artpilots as well as the Museum’s upper management.</p>
      <p>What led us to include “laboratory” in the name was
        the wish to signal that the fundamental idea behind the centre and the Web site
        is to let museum staff and young people produce new knowledge together.
        Experiments are being carried out and the results of these meetings are new
        knowledge. We wished to have a constructivist approach to understanding the
        concept of knowledge, and acknowledge the different levels of knowledge and
        experience the museum and the young people represent. From here we could focus
        on how these two positions enriched each other. All activities in u.l.k. are offspring of this fundamental idea.
      So far, u.l.k. consists of five elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The
        Web site</li>
      <li>The
        artpilots –  young people age
        15-20 </li>
      <li>Education
        workshops led by artists - varying in length from two hours to two days,and
        demanding a ‘hands-on’ and ‘minds-on’ approach from the students.</li>
      <li>The
        exhibition – an interactive exhibition curated by the museum and the
        artpilots in relation to “This year’s theme”. The exhibition will display some
        of the key works in relation to the theme, and will change during the year
        depending on the products from the workshop. </li>
      <li>u.l.k.
        events – hosted by the artpilots, late at night, at openings, weekends
        and on holidays.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>This might seem a bit
        complex. So here is an example of how this “new knowledge” becomes interesting
      in relation to the Web site. </p>
      <h2>How Do You Fit Into the Picture?</h2>
      <p>In the opening year
        the chosen theme was “How do you fit into the picture?” The team of artpilots
        discussed interesting works with museum staff. From a big pool of works we
        together chose 30 works that we’d like to present as entries on the Web site.
        We composed the entries from knowledge produced by teams of artpilots, research
        curators, educators, artists and conservators. One of the theme works is two
        panels from an altarpiece in the Cathedral of Siena, picturing two saints. We
        worked hard to find access points relevant for today’s youth for these medieval
        works. One opening turned out to be the topic of sacrificing oneself for
        something. As one artpilot said, “Today we’re not ready to sacrifice ourselves
        for anything – not even a new pair of shoes!” This entry on the Web site
        contains the viewpoints of the artpilots, the conservator and the research
        curator and has been put together by an editorial group consisting mainly of
        interns. Passion became the artpilots’ way to understand the medieval artworks,
        and from that starting point their interest in making new contexts for the
        artworks grew around discussions on politics, gender, painting techniques and
        religious fanatics. In other words, the art pilots produced new knowledge
        connected to the specific artworks by bringing them into their perception of
        the world, creating new approaches for the works, and exchanging their
      interpretations with the museum staff.</p>

      became the way to approach medieval art. Screen shot from the u.l.k. Web site. <a href="http://www.smk.dk/ulk">http://www.smk.dk/ulk</a></p>
      <p>The point is that
        the entries created by staff together with artpilots should work as inspiration
        for all users of the Web, site but they are primarily created for educational
        purposes, and demonstrate how many different voices are valid when it comes to
        grasping art. Every year a new theme will introduce new entries on works from
        the collection. This will affect the general content created for the site and
        give all of us new learning. But for those users who are interested in art in
        general and want to take part in the community, this educational agenda set by
        staff/artpilots. entries should  be
      viewed only as an additional offering. </p>
      <h1>The Web Site </h1>
      <h2>Purposes</h2>
      <p>We designed the Web site to fulfil two purposes. We
        wished to create a community, and to make it into a Web site well-suited to
      educational purposes. </p>
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>The three most important target audiences are: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>“Free
          teenagers” including the artpilots – in other words teenagers with a
        special interest in arts.</li>
      <li>Teenagers
        using the site in relation to an educational visit. </li>
      <li>Teachers. </li>
    </ol>
      <p>A fourth and secondary target audience is
      professionals, including artists, curators, and educators.</p>
      <p>So far we’ve only had qualitative objectives for
        u.l.k. and the Web site. Our wish is to create new and interesting linkages
        that foster a closer relationship to this new audience through ‘lead users’,
      the artpilots. </p>
      <h2>Techniques</h2>
      <p>To support our constructivist approach we used some of
        the commonly known Web 2.0 “techniques” on the Web site. The core idea in the
        Web site is that everybody can create a profile. With this profile they can
        create entries about whatever they’re interested in. They can also create
        entries together with other users on the site. In order to generate
        navigational access points for these clusters of entries and profiles, we
        encourage the users to tag their entries, comment upon each other’s entries,
        recommend each other’s profiles, and discuss subjects in the forum. We called
        the site’s cumulative entries a “knowledge bank” to illustrate that we expected
        to capture some of the interesting knowledge (user-generated content) being
        created inside and outside the on-site laboratories that comprise u.l.k. Our
        hopes were and are that our knowledge bank will continue to grow stronger over
      the years.</p>

      <a href="http://www.smk.dk/ulk">http://www.smk.dk/ulk</a></p>
      <p>From our
        target audience analysis we learned (Lund, L. &amp; A.T.S. Nielsen, 2006) that
        teenagers spend most of their on-line time contributing to the Web by creating
        user-generated content for social networks. One might say that they spend a lot
        of time maintaining their aura on the Web. We also knew what would be special about the u.l.k. community in comparison
        and competition with other big community sites such as MySpace, Flickr, YouTube
        and Facebook. These distinctions are that the u.l.k community is carried by a
        serious interest in arts (e.g. visual arts, theatre, music, movies, fashion and
        literature) and is qualified by the interaction between the on-site and on-line
      community. </p>
      <h2>The Community</h2>
      <p>We wanted
        the community to evolve from the artpilots. At the time we launched the Web site, we had already been
        working with 70 artpilots, and some of them made their profiles and encouraged
        their friends as well. In this regard the launch was a success. We had around
      200 profiles before the Summer Holidays without doing any marketing at all. </p>
      <p>The vital reason to create the art community was that
        the interest was there – and still is. We didn’t start off wanting to
        create a community. Our starting point was discovering how the Museum could
        become relevant to this young and critical audience. Through our studies and
        the collaboration with the artpilots we learned that the answer was to create a
      community: it was the tool they and we needed. </p>
      <p>What we didn’t have was experience regarding how big
        an ongoing task it is to maintain, support and develop the community site.
        During the Summer Holidays the Web site hibernated. We made a mistake in not
        taking seriously enough the maintenance of the Web site after launch. Examining
        the log files made it clear that activity was high in May, then dropped a lot,
        and increased again when the educational activities began in September. While
        writing this paper, we’re preparing a strategy for the improvements needed on
        the site. For instance, many users have just visited the Web site once and
        never returned to work seriously with their profile. This cursory usage leaves
      a mark of emptiness on the site. </p>
      <p>If we could re-do the project, one of our key points
        would be to give the artpilots much more responsibility for the Web site right
        from the launch. They should of course create and perform activities on-line as
        they did on-site. Instead, what happened was paradoxically that they made a
        MySpace profile where they communicated their project. Of course it was a great
        initiative from a marketing point of view, but it was also symptomatic.
        Interviews with the artpilots have revealed that they have lost the feeling of
        the Web site as theirs, so all the good energy and the spirit from the on-site
        community has not influenced the on-line community. This means that we’ve so
        far not been sufficiently good at emphasising one of the community’s biggest
        advantages and using  the synergy.
        There’s no doubt that the on-site community is thriving and has been a success.
        This gives the artpilots a feeling of being together, included in a lively
      community, with others sharing the same interest in arts.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 4: On Wednesday evenings and during the weekends young
      people gather to enjoy themselves and participate in u.l.k. events</p>
      <p>We’re just about to change this vicious circle. A new
        team of artpilots will soon start, and they’ll be involved to a much greater
        extent in running the Web site: reporting news, inventing activities with
        on-line and on-site aspects, and keeping ongoing debates in the forum. Our
        interviews with users of the site revealed that it’s important to nurse the
        community and involve the Web site. We have learned the hard way that the
        activity level in an on-line community is essential to the value of it. Our
        mistake was to rely too much on the users to increase this activity by
        themselves, simply because we didn’t have previous experience, and
        unfortunately ran short of resources at a crucial moment in the process. A
        change of director at the SMK - announced just before the opening of u.l.k. -
        led to several months with great organizational and financial uncertainties for
        the Museum, and stalled the project. We now have a full-time staff member to take
        care of and develop the work with the artpilots, and a full-time staff member
      to run and develop the educational programme in u.l.k. </p>

        the u.l.k. concept: Fine arts, fashion, movies, music and literature. It is
      clear when you look at the Art Pilot profiles. This is Camilla’s profile.</p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>What wasn’t quite the same success at the moment of
        the launch was the educational part of the project. An essential problem for
        the project was that due to political and management interests, we had to
        launch The Egmont Knowledge Centre at a really difficult time from an
        educational point of view. It was in late April at the end of the school
        season, just when everybody began to think about exams and before the planning
        the next school season. The intention from the beginning had been that the
        educational offerings would be one of the most important “marketing tools”,
        because in every school class there would be at least a couple of teenagers
        interested in art who would learn about the opportunities in u.l.k. during a
      school visit. </p>
      <p>We weren’t quite ready, either. Between the launch in
        April and November 2007, we  experimented to find the best form for our education programme and continually
        improve it. Actually we’re still just beginning to understand the great
        potential the Web site has. In our new digital workshops we’ve provided
        computers with digital tools that we have had to learn to use ourselves - while
        artists working in new media suddenly are becoming relevant in a new way.
        On-site we’re using Linux computers and free open source software. All these
        new possibilities have presented challenges to us. We underestimated how much
        work it would give us. But we’re looking forward to using these resources
        better in order to enrich the Web site with interesting content from the many
      workshops.</p>
      <p>Yet another challenge in relation to creating this new
        educational offering was the staff/artpilot entries. It turned out to be a
        major time-consuming process with our desire to give emphasis to the many
        different voices in relation to each work in the theme. After a reality check,
        we reduced the number of works we want to present from 30 to 10 a year. And
        still we’re completely dependent on interns to run the editorial group. This
        generates many uncertainties for both the interns and the rest of the staff
      engaged in those entries.</p>
      <p>Another problem with the site has been the teachers’
        entry points to the knowledge bank. It seems that teachers are impatient users.
        They haven’t got the same curiosity and interest as the teens to lose
        themselves in the site. We learned that they need quick instructions, easy
        access, and support to understand why they should include a Web site like
      u.l.k. in their educational curriculum. </p>
      <h1>Who’s The Owner?</h1>
      <p>Interviews have revealed other challenges for us in
        reviving the Web site: the purposes of the site are not evident to the target
        audiences. We made the classic mistake of not conducting usability tests in the
        design phase because of our very tight deadlines. Considering this, it’s great
        that we worked closely with the artpilots when we developed the design.
        Interviews with users of the Web site have proved that the look and feel of  the homepage is enticing, exciting, and
        rouses the curiosity of the teenagers, and they also fancy most of the ruling
        design principles. And this is in spite of the fact that they find it quite
        difficult to navigate on the Web site (even the artpilots) and that they are
      quite puzzled by the terminology used to structure the content.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="Nielsen.fig.6.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="400" height="324"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 6: Go participate! The u.l.k. concept is both an
      on-line and an on-site art community</p>
      <p>During the creation phase we needed quite difficult
        and self-invented terms to understand how to make our concept operational. For
        instance, the knowledge bank is an example of a term not well suited for
        traditional impatient Web users. What we need to do better is to clarify the
        twofold purpose of the Web site to the users so we can quickly lead them to the
        key pages relevant for their interests, because there is obscure terminology
        still present in the design and navigation. Even eager users continue to have a
        feeling that they don’t fully understand the fundamental idea of the site or
        how to use all the options it seems to offer. This is a clear sign that we need
      to make the prime functions simpler to comprehend.</p>
      <p>Looking back at the process, we thought we had solved
        this matter already during the work with the specification and  design because the artpilots were
        involved. However we weren’t aware of how quickly the artpilots began to
        resemble the rest of the museum staff in the project, and thus were blind to
        the same issues. Moreover, conceptualizing the whole project at the same time
        as developing the accompanying Web site meant that we sometimes had to force
      decisions that we weren’t quite ready to make. </p>
      <p>When we ask the users who they think the owner of the
        Web site is, they respond that it is the SMK, but they are also very aware of
        the community talking through the Web site. For users who haven’t yet been
        engaged in the community on-site, it’s a strong signifier that the museum’s
        logo is visible on the Web site. It gives them a feeling of professionalism,
        seriousness, and sets the stage for the on-site activities. At the same time
        they are a bit confused about how much the young people are allowed to decide,
        and what level of control the museum exercises over the Web site. One example
        is that due to the tight production deadlines we chose to limit the number of
        personalization tools available in the profiles. But since almost all of our
        users are used to designing their own MySpace profiles, they experience it as a
        way of controlling them, restraining them or not taking them seriously enough.
        In other words, it’s important to meet expectations set by other sites, or at
      least try to. </p>
      <p>We think of the u.l.k. community as an on-line space
        we only partly influence. Our hope is that teenagers using the site will think
        of it as their on-line art space facilitated by us. Then it will realize its
        potential as a social network and thus be an alternative learning space as
        well. The teenagers might not be very interested in the specific knowledge we
        hold at the museum or the ordinary activities we present, but via us they can
        meet others with the same interest, and together gain more interest and
        knowledge. Interviews showed us that some of them prefer each other’s knowledge
        as entry points, and then slowly gain broader interest. A cool profile’s
        recommendation of an artist is a far more interesting tip than what we can
        provide, but teens might never discover it if we don’t facilitate the right
        setting for the discovery. Collective intelligence has a lot of power here as
      well as on the rest of the Web. </p>

      <h1>Future Perspectives</h1>
      <p>Although we cannot say that our on-line community
        has been a success yet, it hasn’t been a failure either. We have confidence
        that the atmosphere from the on-site community will diffuse into the on-line
        community when we continue to give it the time and effort required. The process
        continues within the museum as well. We are still in the process of learning
      how to become a museum relevant for this audience.</p>
      <p>The u.l.k. site has the chance to become an
        alternative to Facebook, MySpace, Flickr and others. Many users on these huge
        sites have removed themselves from active participation because they feel they
        spend too much meaningless time with superficial contact and spam. In
        comparison, the u.l.k. site is a serious site, a small, exclusive and non-aggressive
      site designed for exchanging specific art knowledge and experience. </p>
      <p>We also use the Web site as a Web 2.0-influenced
        prototype to learn much more about our Web audience in general. We’re soon
        about to re-launch the Museum’s main Web site. The new site will be comprised
        of several sub sites like the u.l.k. Web site, and when  users of the u.l.k. site get older, we
        should be able to meet their expectations with a Web site that can extend the
      user experience they’ve already had.</p>
      <p>One thing we’ve also learned from this evaluation is
        that interest in art and the use-based behaviour and need of the users (Peacock, D. and J. Brownbill, 2007) are very
        important for understanding how to be relevant for the users – these
        patterns often move across traditional demographic segmentation. Young people
        are not just the young people. Some of them have an interest in the site
        because they are very creative and want to become artists themselves. Others
        approach the site from a more theoretical point of view; they perhaps want to
        read art history and are very interested in just learning and discussing. The
        art interest determines the way they use the Web site - how often and for how
      long in their lives.  </p>
