      <p class="AbstractText">The Walker Art Center is one of the leading contemporary
        art centers in the world and is known as a laboratory for developing new ways
        to engage visitors and their communities. For more than 15 years, the Walker
        Art Center Teen Arts Council (WACTAC) has been a successful model for engaging
        teenagers through contemporary art and artists. Upon examining their on-line
        presence, teens.walkerart.org, WACTAC became increasingly dissatisfied with the
        content, dated interface, and stagnant nature of the site. In March 2007,
        WACTAC and the Walker’s New Media and Education departments collaborated to
        design and implement a Web site that allows teenagers to create their own
        content using readily available social networking applications. In this paper
        we will examine the process of developing a site that balances the needs of an
      institution and the desires of its teenage users.</p>

      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>For more than 15 years, the Walker Art Center has been the innovative
        leader in teen programming, providing cultural institutions around the world
        with a successful model for engaging teenagers. Walker Teen Programs connects
        teenagers with living artists, raises their awareness of the art of our time,
        and provides ways for teenagers to voice their own creativity and comment on
        their own culture. The centerpiece of Walker Teen Programs is the Walker Art
        Center Teen Arts Council (WACTAC), a diverse group of 14 young people who meet
        weekly to create for teenagers programs and events such as artist talks, teen
        art showcases, and hands-on workshops. Programs designed by WACTAC draw over
        6,000 people annually, and teens account for 10% of the total audience,
      excluding school tours.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Boring and non-offensive, the old WACTAC Web site,

      <a href="http://teens.walkerart.org/old/">http://teens.walkerart.org/old/</a> </p>
      <p>Since 2000, Walker Teen Programs has had an on-line
        presence, teens.walkerart.org. The goal of the Web site was a to create a space
        where teenagers and museum colleagues could visit regularly to find information
        about upcoming programs at the Walker. It was developed primarily as a calendar
        and program archive; the site was regularly updated, but the information that
        was listed was didactic and institutionalized. Prompted by negative feedback
      from new WACTAC members, staff began thinking about a redesign of the site. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="justin_heideman_fig2_thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="400" height="310"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2: Walker Blogs,<br/> 
      <a href="http://blogs.walkerart.org/">http://blogs.walkerart.org/</a></p>
      <p>The Walker’s New Media Initiatives (NMI) department is
        widely respected for developing innovative on-line educational resources. In
        2005, the Walker launched its official blog (<a href="http://blogs.walkerart.org/">http://blogs.walkerart.org</a>) as a
        component of the main Walker Web site (<a href="http://walkerart.org/">http://walkerart.org</a>). Since then, it
        has become a highly trafficked portion of the Walker’s site and is ranked among
        the most popular museum blogs on the Web. This success can be attributed to the
        precipitous growth of blogs and their consumption by the public as well as
        their accessibility on the Walker site. Through a high contribution rate by
        Walker staff and guest bloggers, the perception of the Walker as an elitist
        institution has been challenged. Walker blogs serve as a less-filtered conduit
        for both Walker- and non-Walker-related information and provide a space for the
        general public to interact with and gain insight into the personal interests of
        Walker staff, art-related or otherwise. This humanizes the institution and
      broadens its appeal in a way that more refined forms of communication cannot.</p>
      <h1>Audience</h1>
      <p>Once we started examining how the site would be used, two
        audience groups emerged. Each group had different goals and needs regarding
        what content should be there, where it should come from, and how refined it
        should be. One group - museum colleagues, educators, parents, and teachers -
        frequently requests didactic information such as the history of Teen Programs,
      general WACTAC info, WACTAC applications, and advice regarding best practice. </p>
      <p>However, WACTAC identified teenagers as the primary audience
        of the site. They wanted to see the site include writing related to their own
        activities, to utilize multimedia tools, and to have the ability to display
        interesting things they have found. WACTAC was interested in the site’s
        representing their role within the Walker and their interests outside of the
      institution.</p>
      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>According to the Pew Internet Project on American Life’s
        study, “Social Networking Websites and Teens” (Lenhart and Madden, 2007), 93
        percent of teens are on-line, and 55 percent of teens are engaged in social
        networking on-line. Of social networkers, “those who have such profiles are
        much more likely to be bloggers than those who do not have social network
        profiles.” Our informal sampling of WACTAC members showed that nearly every
        member was using social networking (MySpace or Facebook), and about half
        considered themselves generally Internet savvy. It was clear to us that in
        order to be successful, we would need to take aspects of social networking and
      incorporate those principles into the new teen site.</p>
      <p>WACTAC and Walker staff also examined the sites designed for
        teenagers created by other institutions. We were impressed by the depth of content
        and interactive elements on a few sites, but noted that large amounts of staff
        time and museum resources would be required to achieve that level of
        production. In addition, it was not clear whether teenagers would repeatedly
        engage the seemingly static teen sites. Conversely, teens are accustomed to
        checking sites for frequent updates and place higher value on social networking
        profiles that are updated more frequently (Lenhart and Madden, 2007). According
        to a 2007 memo by Lenhart and Madden, “Almost half of social network-using
      teens visit the sites either once a day (26%) or several times a day (22%).” </p>
      <p>As a part of our process, WACTAC looked at and responded to
        the aesthetics of social networking sites. Researcher Danah Boyd (2007) has
        written much on the divide between users of Facebook and MySpace and how they
        see the sites. Interestingly, Boyd sees that the way teens flock to the sites
        often falls across class lines, with more upper-class or upwardly mobile teens
        using Facebook, and other teens flocking to MySpace. Boyd writes that users of
        Facebook see MySpace as “gaudy, immature and ‘so middle school.’” Avowed users
        of MySpace, however, see the site as “bling” or “fly” and value the brash
        visual displays so often found on MySpace. After conversing with WACTAC about
        the aesthetics of social networking, we came to the conclusion that a
        customizable visual design element was another way for individual WACTAC
      members’ personalities to be represented. </p>
      <h1>Goals</h1>
      <p>Our first goal was to provide WACTAC with a sense of
        ownership of the site. Teen Programs’ staff believe that in order for programs
        to be successful, WACTAC must be involved with the process. All of the WACTAC
        programs and events are conceived and implemented by WACTAC members themselves.
        In order to make WACTAC ownership a priority, the staff had to treat
        teens.walkerart.org as an educational program in itself. The staff realized
        that if WACTAC actively engaged in the site, other teenagers would be
        interested. While a new site might bring increased traffic, we decided our
        measure of success would be the site’s relevance to WACTAC teens and their
      social circle. </p>
      <p>Our second goal was to make the site  a place where the teenagers could share
        their writing, arts criticism, interviews, and reviews. Past WACTAC groups have
        organized exhibitions showcasing teen artwork on-line, but these have served as
        one-time, event-specific vessels. WACTAC desired an ongoing on-line exhibition
        space for teenagers and a more integrated approach for showing teen work on-line.
        In addition to a teen art section, we also wanted to provide teens with a way
        to highlight events that they are programming or are interested in attending.
        These events could be happening at the Walker or elsewhere. WACTAC wanted the
        ability to curate a list of events they feel are relevant to themselves and
        other teenagers. Additionally, WACTAC felt there was a lack of information on
        all ages’ events in the Twin Cities. We thought this listing would be a great
        resource, serving as an “underage page” - an area of promotion that seems to be
      missing in the Twin Cities. </p>
      <p>A third goal for the site was to incorporate Web 2.0
        strategies. The final design would need to be capable of easily connecting to
        other Web-based tools such as YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, etc, where a teen
        audience already exists. At the same time, we didn’t want the site to be tied
        to a particular service provider or social networking site. We wanted it to be
        a hub for content that comes from or goes to other Web 2.0 services, and did
        not want to enforce a rigorous structure on the teens when they decide to add
      content to the site.</p>
      <p>The final stipulation was that the site had to serve
        multiple audiences identified by Walker staff and WACTAC. Aside from the flashy
        Web 2.0 strategies designed to draw WACTAC and other teenagers, the site had to
        accommodate institutional information about Teen Programs, including program
        history, contact information, and WACTAC application materials sought by other
      museum educators, parents, youth workers, and teachers. </p>
      <h1>Outcomes</h1>
      <p>Based on our target audiences, we decided that the site
        should be divided into two distinct sections. We wanted to make sure teen
        voices were highly visible and dominated the structure of the site. The
        institutional information also had to be readily apparent but easily avoidable
      at the same time.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="justin_heideman_fig3_thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="400" height="310"/></p>

      <i><a href="http://teens.walkerart.org/">http://teens.walkerart.org</a></i></p>
      <p>We created a design that combined these two different
        audiences and spheres of information into one site. The site creates an
        architectural framework that satisfies both the high design aesthetic of the
        Walker and the kitschy look of MySpace. The new Web site addresses two audience
        groups very directly by making the viewer immediately indicate what type of
      information they are seeking by simply sliding a divider.</p>

      <i><a href="http://teens.walkerart.org/#wac">http://teens.walkerart.org/#wac</a></i></p>
      <p>The institutional side of the site is labeled “the business
        side of things” and houses all of the Teen Programs’ institutional information.
        Whereas the old site presented much of this content in disparate pages with a
        confusing navigational structure, the new site uses a condensed hierarchical
        structure allowing a visitor to quickly peruse the entire contents. We also
        added a FAQ section, making it easier to find information people are most often
      looking for.</p>

      <a href="http://teens.walkerart.org/#tac"><i>http://teens.walkerart.org/#tac</i></a></p>
      <p>‘The play side of things’ is the WACTAC-driven side of the
        site. It is blog-like in structure, using color-coded boxes in a three-column
        layout to differentiate the blog posts, links, events and artwork. WACTAC
        contributors use a custom-made interface to change the color combinations of
        sections, and can set headline text and background images. Since the launch of
        the site, WACTAC members have used a variety of on-line graphics generators and
        utilized Google image search to mine unique images. We paid special care to try
        to absorb the 1996-esque Web look of MySpace, but still have an organized
        modern feel, like Facebook. If the teens want to add “bling” to the site, they
        have the ability to do so, but also have the capability to tone down the
        aesthetics for a more neutral feel. The default theme for the teens’ side of
        the site is a unicorn-patterned background with a sparkling glitter-text
      headline.</p>
      <p>For the WACTAC portion of the site, we decided on a
        blog-like structure that would consist of four main categories: blogs, links,
        events, and art. Blog posts were built in to the content management system and
        provide a very flexible vessel for just about any type of content, from arts
        criticism to an embedded YouTube video. Links serve as quick and easy content
        that is curated by WACTAC members. The Events category provides WACTAC with the
        ability to highlight both Walker and non-Walker events. The last section, art,
        is a special category of blog posts specifically designed to show images and
      artwork information. </p>
      <p>The site is built using the open source blogging tool
        WordPress (<a href="http://wordpress.org/">http://wordpress.org</a>). This gave us the flexibility to customize the
        site where needed by using plug-ins, creating our own plug-ins and making a
        custom theme. Rather than creating the site solely on a third party’s social
        networking platform, we used disparate Web-based tools ideally suited to the
        various types of content. We also used del.icio.us (<a href="http://del.icio.us/">http://del.icio.us</a>)
        to collect the links for the links section on the site, and upcoming.org (<a href="http://upcoming.org/">http://upcoming.org</a>) to gather events. Both of
        these tools allow us to tap into a wealth of links and events that are
        available with these services and give us access to audiences that exist on
        these sites. This approach gives us unparalleled control over presentation, and
        formatting, yet allows for institutional voice via the site’s structure, and
      frees us from being tied to a particular platform provider. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="justin_heideman_fig6_thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="400" height="318"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 6: Customization interface for “Teen Programs and
      WACTAC”</p>
      <p>Whereas MySpace allows anyone to enter their own CSS code to
        customize the look of a  page, our
        customization interface is more limited. The teens can choose colors using a
        color picker tool similar to that found in Photoshop. They can also set the
        background image and header text for their side of the site. The interface
        allows them to preview the changes before committing to a particular design.
        This structure gives the teens much of the same ability to customize as
        MySpace, but restricts them from doing things that would severely harm the
        usability of the site, such as making all the text gigantic or leaving
        fragmented code that would disable the page. In order to maintain a
        contemporary aesthetic, we used animated transitions and effects, such as
        collapsing the different types of posts when the user clicks on the header at
      the top of the page.</p>
      <p>Each WACTAC member has a username and password and has
        access to posting a blog and adding a link, event or artwork. WACTAC wanted the
        ability to be able to post quickly with little to no administrative or editing
        intervention by staff. This type of ‘immediate posting’ gives the WACTAC
        contributors a sense of ownership because the content is not edited by the
        museum, making it free of stuffy institution-speak. In looking at other
        museum-based teen Web sites, we noticed that the majority of the sites
        displayed a highly produced, marketing-heavy approach. In response, the design
        of the new teens.walkerart.org employs a ‘Do-It-Yourself’ tone in terms of
      design and language. </p>
      <p>We have been pleasantly surprised with the success of the
        site since it went live in October 2007. Before the launch of the site, we
        brought together a group of five WACTAC members to brainstorm ideas about
        content. Our hope was that this core group would provide the majority of the
        content. Thus far, 11 of the 14 WACTAC core members so far have participated in
        the content of the site by posting blog entries or artwork, and the visual
        theme for the site has been re- customized over 30 times. Since the launch,
        there have been 76 blog posts, 21 links, and numerous events listings.
        According to our internal server statistics, traffic on the site has increased
        dramatically with the new site. Page views went from around 4,000 views prior
        to launch to an average of over 135,000 between October – December 2007.
        Page views are likely inflated based on how the new site works (it uses AJAX heavily),
        but unique visitors have also nearly doubled in the same time range, from
        around 1,500 to just over 2,500. Most excitingly, user time (measured in
      seconds) on the site has gone from about 70 seconds to 376 seconds. </p>
      <h1>Future Expansion</h1>
      <p>As our experience with the site grows, we plan on making a
        number of enhancements beyond simple bug fixes and updates. The first and most
        obvious expansion is a tighter integration with social networking services. One
        thing we learned working on other projects is that it makes sense to go where
        your audience already exists, rather than trying to pull people from somewhere
        else. Nearly all of the WACTAC members have profiles on Facebook, a site that
        allows developers to create applications that interact with aspects of members’
        profiles. We envision an application that retrieves the content from the Web
        site and inserts the material into each individual WACTAC member’s Facebook
        profile. The audience is limited to WACTAC and their friends, but given the way
      that social networking works, that encompasses a fairly large group of teens.</p>
      <p>While the site was designed to be a mish-mash of things, we
        would like to have an anchor feature on the Web site, such as video of studio
        visits with local artists. Along with this, the frequency of posting is
        something we are examining. Also, we have seen few additions to the art section
        of the site. Our initial intent was to use the Web site to showcase artwork
        created by WACTAC or non-WACTAC members, where teenagers could share, discuss,
        and critique each other’s artwork. To resolve this deficiency, we are
        considering linking to an existing social networking platform such as
      deviantart.com or flickr.com.</p>
      <p>In the end, the most important guiding question for
        teens.walkerart.org is, “How do we stay relevant to teenagers on-line?” We learned
        that to be successful in drawing teenagers to our site, we must continue to be
        aware of new technologies that attract young people. We also realized that an
        open, flexible vessel for emerging types of content and numerous authors is a
        valuable asset. In the future we must take advantage of the applications that
        allow us the greatest flexibility without devouring considerable resources, and
        most of all, we must continue with a spirit of experimentation and commitment
      to youth directedness.</p>
