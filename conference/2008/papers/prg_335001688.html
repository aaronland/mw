  <p class="AbstractText">It is
    now common to include the visitor to a museum by means of new technologies and
    the possibilities they afford. Visitors’ voices on exhibitions can be
    heard both on-site and on-line. This paper presents and compares interactive design pieces that intend to
    motivate visitors to participate in co-creating the message of the museum by
    leaving in-depth commentaries. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">Design options are chosen as parameters for comparison
    because they affect participation and therefore the museum visit experience.
    The design options relate to the theme chosen for participation and how openly
    this theme is presented, as well as the atmosphere of the piece, the
    input-output modalities, the on-site or on-floor configurations, the
    accessibility and the ties with the time of the visit and with the larger
    community. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">Designers geared towards creating
    or using tools that encourage participation must be aware that all design
    options modify responses. Comparing these projects is a way to point out how
    interactive pieces can affect visitors’ participation in the museum and with it
    the experience of the visit. </p>

     <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>As part of my research I was involved in producing
        concepts and prototypes that delve deeply into participation. I made a
        selection of projects and compared them in order to obtain a broader vision of
        participation and begin to build a
        framework to understand it in relation to the exhibition context and to related
        on-line materials. This comparison is mainly
        based on readings about the projects described and not on actual use of or
        participation in them. In this paper, I make reference to some interactive
        design pieces that allow participants (visitors or museum staff) to make
      in-depth commentaries and share them with other visitors. </p>
      <p>The idea of investigating this issue came from a
        simple observation: a visit to an exhibition changes a great deal, depending on
        whom we are with. It is very different if we go to see art with an artist
        friend, if we go with our children, or parents, or another friend, or alone.
        The conversations about the exhibition elicited by what we see can be
        registered on-site, as sound, writings, drawings and video traces. Thus, others
        can have access to these opinions and comment on them. At the same time, many
        specialists go to exhibitions in their own fields; if one visits an anthropology
        museum, for example, one will mostly certainly come across an anthropologist.
        Hence, tools that allow the audience to make their small contributions or leave
        their marks could give access to the knowledge of experts who visit the
      exhibition. </p>
      <p>Until recently, visitors to exhibitions and museums
        were relegated to the role of observers. That means that, usually, visitors’
        contributions were neither considered nor solicited. Currently, though, there
        are some isolated cases where the audience’s participation forms a part of a
        work of art. Yet this participation is limited by the conditions and the
        possibilities proposed by the artist. In reaction, and probably as a
        consequence of widespread participation in making and spreading content on the
        Internet, a new tendency has gradually emerged. It entails the active inclusion
        of the visitors by means of new social technologies and the possibilities they
        afford. Exhibiting on-site is
        museums’ traditional area of expertise, but displaying their knowledge on-line
      using Web 2.0 language and resources is relatively new. </p>
      <p>Participation in
        exhibitions through interactive design pieces might entail commenting on blogs
        or wikis (http://museumofglass.org/blogs/art/category/),
        tagging, bookmarking (Filippini-Fantoni and Bowen, 2007), sharing images (www.ingenious.org.uk/Create/), videos or photos, sending e-cards, sending e-mails
        (Filippini-Fantoni and Bowen, 2007), sending postcards (<a href="http://www.ingenious.org.uk/Create/">www.ingenious.org.uk/Create/</a>), making your own gallery (<a href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/English/">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/English/</a>),
        collaborative mapping (Salgado and Diaz, 2006), or personalizing a museum tour (Aroyo, L. et al, 2007) or audio
      tour (Samis and Pau, 2006) for creating content. </p>
      <p>Sometimes visitors want to say something, and
        sometimes they would rather be passive viewers. Participating is not for
        everyone, and certainly not for everyone at all times. A piece inspires them,
      brings back a memory that they might want to share. </p>
      <p>The interactive
        pieces chosen for this comparison are part of the following projects: <b>Science
          Buzz (</b>the site of the Science
        Museum of Minnesota, USA)(Von Appen et al, 2006), <b>Room
          of Opinion in Re-tracing the past </b>(exhibition
        at the Hunt Museum, Limerick, Ireland)(Ferris et al, 2004), <b>Conversational
          Map in Small Heaven</b> (exhibition in Taidehalli, Helsinki, Finland) (Salgado and Diaz, 2006), <b>Art
            cast series</b> (Podcasting in San
        Francisco Museum of Modern Art, USA) (Samis and Pau,
        2006), <b>Moving Here</b> (on-line exhibition, UK)(Alain and Foggett, 2007), and <b>Art Work Communication System Using Mobile
          Phone</b> (exhibition at the
        Museum of Municipal Art of Toyota, Japan)( Fushimi et
        al, 2006). Through these pieces, visitors can decide if they want
        to listen to what the artists have to say about their work, or what the
        curator, the researcher, the museum conservationist, and/or other visitors of
        the same age have to say about it. These
      projects serve as tools for understanding participation in a designerly way.</p>
      <h1>Design Options</h1>
      <p>Certain design
        decisions are key to participation. The design options are taken as parameters
        for comparison because they affect participation and therefore the museum visit
      experience. </p>
      <p>The parameters are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Theme</i> chosen for participation, and the openness with which it is
        presented</li>
      <li><i>Atmosphere</i> of the piece</li>
      <li><i>Input-output</i> modalities</li>
      <li><i>On-line</i> and/or <i>on-site</i> configurations</li>
      <li><i>Accessibility </i></li>
      <li>Ties to the actual <i>time</i> of the visit</li>
      <li>Ties to the <i>community</i><i>.</i> </li>
     </ul>
      <p>The topic is a
        crucial stimulus to participation. There are certain <i>themes</i> that both spark the personal interest of the
        visitors and satisfy the needs of the museum researchers. When these themes are
        dealt with, the exhibition is not presented as a complete and closed statement,
        but solicits visitors’ contributions. Both the topic chosen and the openness
        with which it is presented can goad participation. Another issue is how the
        theme of a discussion is relevant to the exhibition’s overall message. Visitors
        could be asked to give a commentary on a topic that is essential to the
      exhibition or be asked about a secondary topic. </p>
      <p>These interactive
        design pieces have a certain feeling or <i>atmosphere.</i> Atmosphere necessarily connects with the
        question of stand design (lights, sounds, colors, and props elements around the
        physical stand), its location in the physical exhibition, the software (if
        there is software running on a mobile phone, PDA, or computer), the devices
        used, the nature of the exhibition where the interactive piece is placed, and
      the content material gathered. </p>
      <p>There are different <i>input
        modalities</i> such as leaving an
        audio, video or written comment to frame the result. Also important is the way
        that visitors are asked to participate. Giving visitors a specific task to
        perform will elicit a different response than asking a straightforward question
      or just showing other visitors’ comments. </p>
      <p>External factors
        also influence how to motivate visitors’ participation. For example, in cases
        where the object exhibited (work of art, historical artifact or other) cannot
        be used on-line to elicit comments, provocative questions could lead to
        fruitful discussion. <i>Output modalities</i><b> </b>are the ones
        that relates to the navigation, shareability and visibility of the materials
        left by the visitors at the exhibition or in other media channels such as
        Internet. Visitors create material that can be shown to others (family and
        friends, or anonymous others) or kept to themselves after the visit. These
        materials are sent to the visitor by e-mail, enjoyed in situ, or accessed on
      the museum’s Web site. </p>
      <p>Designing how the
        material is managed is a crucial issue. It includes the visibility and
        classification of the messages (how they are displayed: by relevancy, by date
        produced, or by author, or according to other criteria), moderation guidelines
        (who decides and selects messages, selection criteria), and publication delay
      (how long it takes to publish a comment after it is produced). </p>
      <p><i>Configurations</i><b> </b>can
        mix <i>on-line</i> (leaving
        messages on the Web site) and <i>on-site</i> (leaving messages in situ, at the exhibition) materials.
        Configurations vary, depending on the media involved and the devices used for
        allowing participation as mobile phones, PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants),
        PMP (Portable Media Player), and fixed stands in the museum space.
        Location-based systems can address to certain pieces, or guide the navigation
        inside the exhibition. The interactive pieces can be single or multi-user, thus
      influencing how groups interact at the exhibition. </p>
      <p>Museums have other
        means, such as publications and souvenirs, to engage the visitor after the
        visit. Interactive pieces connect visitors with the<b> </b><i>time</i><b> </b>of the visit
        while they leave messages on-site or on-line. Visitors might return to the Web
        site <i>after</i> the visit to add
        something to their message, or else to see other visitors’ comments about their
        previous comment. Interactive pieces can also be used <i>before</i> the visit. Visitors can visit the Web site
        with comments or questions about the exhibition before going to see it. These
        comments can lead people to pay special attention to certain pieces they read
        comments about on at the Web site. In parallel we have to consider the moment
        in time the visitor meets the interactive piece (whether the piece is in blank
        or full of comments). The tone and style of the first comments gathered will
      influence future material. </p>
      <h1>Accessibility And Community Involvement </h1>
      <p><i>Accessibility</i> involves issues related to visitors with
        perceptual, cognitive and/or motor disabilities, as well as varying degrees of
        computer literacy and familiarity with the devices and technology involved. The
        interactive piece at the exhibition (including the software, stand and device)
      as well as the Web site needs to consider issues of accessibility. </p>
      <p>Non-frequent
        visitors to the museum are intimidated by the exhibitions and find them
        difficult to access (Hooper-Greenhill, 1994, p.33). New social technologies in the exhibition context should aim to facilitate
        access to the exhibition’s materials, and be aware of visitors’ levels of
        computer literacy. Finding personal comments left by other visitors motivates
        the use of new technology and makes the exhibition material easier to approach.
        In this way the intimidating barrier breaks. About this, Fushimi
        (Fushimi et al, 2006) states: “the vocabulary of the viewer allows visitors to
      connect to the work in a different way”. </p>
      <p>There are many ways the<i> community</i> can take part in an exhibition. Indeed, the
        core of many exhibitions is built in cooperation with the community (Hooper-Greenhill, 1994, p. 22): the future visitor
        produces the content and hence develops a commitment to the exhibition. This is
        the case of the ExhibitCommons project (LaBar, 2006),where future visitors
        design and create exhibits. If the dialogue with the community starts before
        the exhibition is installed, it is easier to use interactive pieces to
        continue. But, by connecting users’ on-line and on-site participation, this
        engagement can also be achieved after the exhibition is up (Von Appen et al,
      2006). </p>
      <p>Another strategy for
        community involvement is ICT training courses (Alain and Foggett, 2007) which can create content for exhibition. In the
        case of “The secret life of objects” at the Design Museum in Helsinki (<a href="http://thesecretlifeofobjects.blogspot.com/">http://thesecretlifeofobjects.blogspot.com</a>), workshops were organized in close collaboration
        with the interactive piece at the exhibition. Hence, the result of the
        workshops and the material collected in them could be seen, listened to and
      commented on both on-line and on-site. </p>
      <p>Issues of
        accessibility and community involvement are not on the comparison table because
      they require deep analysis both on-site and on-line. </p>
      <h1>Projects Compilation</h1>
      <p>The projects described below show different ways that
        visitors participate in exhibitions by leaving in-depth comments. Each of these
        projects opens up the possibility of a dialogue with the artists, curators,
        designers, educators, researchers, and on-line and on-site visitors. Each one
        of these projects has unique characteristics, target group, and focuses. All of them entail opening up dialogues and
      discussions related to the exhibitions.</p>
      <p><i>Science Buzz</i> (2004-present) (Von
        Appen et al, 2006) is a site built by the Science Museum of Minnesota (<a href="http://smm.org/buzz">http://smm.org/buzz</a>)
        that uses a blog, <i>Buzz Blog</i>,
        to allow visitors to leave comments. The project networks the exhibitions with
        an active on-line community commenting and asking questions in the form of blog
        or poll. Here, visitors to the Science Museum of Minnesota can leave questions
        for scientists at stands distributed throughout the exhibition. To complete the
        process, scientists answer the questions and the visitors can look at their
        responses and dialogues on the Internet or during their next museum visit. The
        discussion is interesting as it offers new perspectives on each topic. Many
        visitors to the Web site have become active members of the community, committed
        to the virtual and real museum. The Science Buzz project stands and blog
      connect visitors’ curiosity with experts’ knowledge. </p>
      <p><i>Retracing the
        past: exploring objects, stories, mysteries</i> (June 2003) was an exhibition held in the Hunt Museum (Ferris et
        al, 2004). The Hunt Museum and the Interaction Design Centre of the University
        of Limerick, in Ireland, jointly developed this exhibition. At that exhibition
        there was a <b>Room of Opinion </b>where
        visitors could leave a message about the nature and possible use of some
        mysterious objects. Comments were collected, and visitors could listen to them
        in real time through a radio in the Study Room. The sound of earlier opinions
        also generated a sort of murmur that was heard in the same room. Comments were
        made using an interactive telephone. A visual analogue of the process of
        storing the comments could be seen in a dynamic graphic display representing a visual trace of
      these opinions. Visitors could see and listen to their own comments recorded. </p>
      <p><i>Conversational
        Map</i> (November 2005) (Salgado
        and Diaz, 2006) could be explored and commented on during four days of
        the Young Artists’ Biennale: Small Heaven in Taidehalli, Helsinki. The Systems
        of Representation Research Group of the Media Lab at the University of Art and
        Design, Helsinki, developed this interactive piece, using ImaNote software (<a href="http://imanote.uiah.fi/">http://imanote.uiah.fi/</a>). Visitors entering the museum hall saw a map of the exhibition projected on the
        wall. Visitors could navigate that map, and then they, as well as the museum
        staff, could add comments and links so that, for example, a comment
        about a sculpture could be linked to a song a visitor associates with the work
        of art. Comments referred to one
        of the pieces exhibited or to the whole exhibition, and visitors could see
        these comments while navigating the map. Artists visited frequently to navigate
        the map and see the comments left on it. Traces left at the exhibition could be
        accessed from home, before or after the visit. Many visitors even
        visited the Web site from their own computers in order to leave longer
      comments. </p>
      <p><i>Art Cast Series</i> (2005- present) (Samis
        and Pau, 2006) is a collaboration between the Interactive Educational
        Technologies team in San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) and Bay Area audio experts Antenna Audio, Inc. Art Cast Series
        is part of an exploration into the possibilities of podcasting to offer
        alternative audio tours to museum visitors. In the Arcast series, the <b>Vox
          Pop</b> category is for audience
        comments; the <b>Guest Takes</b> category is for the comments of invited guests, and the <b>Artcast Invitational</b> category is for submitting carefully composed
        standalone contributions. In one of the trials, pictures accompanied the sound
        tracks. The <b>bonus track</b> is
        another category that consists of a loosely structured audio tour with the
      voice of the artist. </p>
      <p><i>Moving
        Here </i>(2005-2007)(Alain
        and Foggett, 2007) includes five regional projects involving museums, archives
        and libraries throughout England. Several partners worked with the
        project’s development (<a href="http://www.movinghere.org.uk/about/partners.htm">www.movinghere.org.uk/about/partners.htm</a>). Visitors were encouraged to leave the stories of their own
        migration on the Web site and to add their own materials, such as photos,
        poems, drawings, etc. Visitors
        could link the material in the archive using, for example, the Tracing Your
        Roots tool to reconstruct a migration story. Training sessions were organized
        around England in order to allow people with different computer skills to visit
        and participate in the exhibition. There were also ICT training lessons on-line
        to help visitors to use the site. Half of the material was collected during the
        ICT sessions and half from
      Internet surfers. </p>
      <p><i>Art Communication
        System with Mobile Phones</i> (2005-present) (Fushimi et al, 2006) is being developed by the Hiroshima Kokusai Gakuin University and the Nagoya
        University at the Toyota Municipal Museum of Art. Using this system, the
        visitor could leave text messages about two works of art. In a first
        evaluation in December 2005, the idea was that visitors wrote what they felt on
        a mobile phone. Visitors were
        encouraged to respond to the prompt: “Please, write what you felt”; “Please
        choose an observing point and read the comment”. Later, visitors were
        asked to classify their messages by topic: artist, model, background, figure,
        colour, material or other.
        Visitors used a map to find the works in the exhibition. The target visitor was
        unfamiliar with art appreciation. Visitors in front of a work of art could
        read about the sensations experienced by others. According to Fushimi, observation of this project’s functioning
        suggests that visitors can expand their knowledge by listening to the
      impressions of others.</p>

      <p class="caption"><b>Fig 1: Design comparison</b></p>
      <p>This table contains
        a synthesis of the material analyzed. On the x-axis are the projects and on the
      y-axis there are the design options. </p>
      <p>The themes of the
        projects are quite different, but they all motivate visitors to give personal
        insights based on their curiosity, opinions, critiques, casual observations,
      memories and feelings. </p>
      <p>The atmosphere of
        these projects is the result of a coherent selection of the components that
        make up these interactive pieces. In these projects, the components are the
        stand, devices and software in use, the in-put and out-put modalities, the
        theme chosen and the style of the audible, visual or written material. The
        atmosphere of a certain stand can be in keeping with the exhibition, or attempt
        to clash with it. For example, in the case of Art Communication System, the
        vocabulary used and the interface of the software have an informal style. This
        contrasts with the classic art in the exhibition. The informality is used for
      drawing the visitor not familiar to art appreciation in to the work of art.</p>
      <p>In-puts and out-puts
        can use different modalities to motivate visitors with special skills and
        needs. For example, designers and visual artists benefit from interactive
        pieces that allow them to express their thoughts and arguments in pictures or
        videos since that is part of their practice. Other examples are making use of audio to include visually
        impaired visitors (Salgado and Kellokoski, 2005), or involving young people in
      the creation of podcastings for museums as in the <i>Art Cast Series</i>.</p>
      <p>In design there are always trade-offs. Selecting
        design solutions geared to a particular audience always risks excluding other visitors. One solution
        might be to include multimodal formats and different, yet interconnected,
        modalities and configurations, thus allowing more visitors access. Fisher and Twiss-Garrity (2007) use the term <b>remix </b>to refer to the process of
        understanding, interpreting and making a coherent narrative by means of the
        technology and materials offered by the exhibition. Visitors’ remixes are
      motivated insofar as their personal needs and practices are considered. </p>
      <p>On-site and on-line configurations open
        up the opportunity to connect with visitors’ thoughts after their visits. What
        thoughts have been awakened by a certain exhibition? Which artifact/idea
      inspired those thoughts? </p>
      <p>The management of
        comments influences visitors’ responses: seeing/listening to comments
      immediately after they are created and published seems to be a positive factor. </p>
      <p>It is not
        particularly productive to compare isolated design options in order to draw
        conclusions since all these projects work in relation to their own context of
        use (the exhibitions). Each project took shape with a coherent choice of design
        options. For example, in Art Communication System (Fushimi et al, 2006) the
        device used is a mobile phone, which is mainly a single user device. Therefore
      the personal question,“What do you feel?” is appropriate.</p>
      <p>In some exhibitions, visitors were asked to comment by
        writing on post-it notes which were then placed on a board<i> </i>(Byatt, 2005). In these cases,
        participation is active, probably more active than when a keyboard for typing
        in opinions is offered. Yet the possibility of making full use of the material
        and navigating it during and after the exhibition is limited. Navigating different formats implies
      challenges. </p>
      <h1>Future Opportunities </h1>
      <p>Through open, interactive participation, exhibitions
        cease to be products shut off the day of the supposed “opening” and become,
        instead, living entities that change with the interpretation of the
        participants both during their visit and afterwards. What are the dialogues that museums seek to
      motivate through their exhibitions?</p>
      <p>On the one hand, displaying visitors’ messages is a
        way to respect their opinions and generate commitment and confidence. How are
        the visitors’ interpretations modified once comments are shared with future
        visitors? How is the museum experience modified once visitors participate
      actively as co-authors of the exhibition message? </p>
      <p>On the other hand, likely outcomes of interactive
        pieces are, for example, debates and discussions among current, past and future
        visitors. Once compiled, this material can allow the museum to study its
        audience and get to know its visitors more specifically, not just as a
        demographic block. Visitors’ subjective perspectives and special interests are
        included. Visitors’ comments can also provide material about the theme of the
        exhibition, material that can then be used to design future exhibitions or to
        shed light on how to analyse practices and discourses within the museum. How
        can the museum use and benefit from the material collected by these new social
      technologies? </p>
      <p>Once these tools for active participation are firmly
        established as part of museums, it will be possible to generate a new
        understanding of roles (whether the audience’s or the staff’s), and will lead
        to mutual enrichment. How do we motivate the inclusion of the larger community
      around the museum? </p>
      <p>Museums could
        participate in the discussion that otherwise takes place in other forums (Von Appen et al, 2006). Hence, museums can affect
        the discussion about their exhibits, sharing their expertise with active
        members of the audience. Conversely, while implementing these interactive
        tools, museums are influencing their design and development in order to better
      suit special needs. How will social technologies develop in the museum context?</p>
      <p>Participation opens
        the exhibition up to subjective interpretations from visitors or from the
        museum staff. It is a means to access other audiences (children, teens, senior
        citizens, people with special needs, etc), to make a place for the unexpected,
        for discordances or for controversy, and for a collaborative mode of gathering
        knowledge, both after and before the visit. How will the
        discussions and the dialogues that open up through visitors’ comments become
      part of the narrative of the exhibition? </p>
      <h1>Concluding Thoughts</h1>
      <p>Visitors are more
        and more prepared to interact with new social technologies in the context of
        museum exhibitions. Once they have had positive experiences with these
      technologies, they are not afraid to participate in interactive pieces. </p>
      <p>Familiarity with
        making comments in other contexts (T.V or Internet forums) positively
        influences museum participation. If the design pieces are user-friendly, they
        provide beginners with an easy way to explore new social technologies. Since
        the activity is geared towards a familiar topic- participants have already
        visited the exhibition- there is no need to search for the forum to use. The possibility lies
      before them.</p>
      <p>Interactive pieces
        open up the possibility to start or continue visitors’ exploration; they are a
      sort of hook that calls visitors to participate, or a way to educate them. </p>
      <p>Exploring
        configurations that connect the museum visit experience with on-line discussion
      offers several benefits: </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li> making interactive design pieces accessible to
        visitors not familiar with these tools and resources, </li>
      <li>engaging visitors already familiar with them, </li>
      <li> offering reference material that enriches and
        focuses the discussion by means of visual, audio, or interactive data in the
        exhibit or on-line, </li>
      <li>extending the museum visit experience to the period after or
        before it, </li>
      <li>including visitors who are not yet a part of the exhibition’s
        community,</li>
      <li>motivating visitors to further their knowledge about the
        exhibition and </li>
      <li>opening communication channels between visitors
        and museum staff.</li>
     </ol>
      <p>Designers geared towards creating or using tools that
        encourage participation must be aware that all design options (the theme chosen for participation and the
        openness with which it is presented, the piece’s atmosphere, the input-output
        modalities, the on-line or on-site configurations, the accessibility, the ties
      with the time of the visit and the ties with the community) modify responses. </p>
      <p>The sense of
        belonging and the confidence produced by visitor participation in the
        exhibition’s discussion and by knowing that their opinions are respected
        positively affects engagement with the exhibition and the institution that
        holds it. It is a feedback loop in which visitors participate by creating knowledge
        that in turn makes the exhibition a richer, more active and inspiring
      experience for future audiences. </p>
