        <p class="AbstractText">Involving children in Cultural Heritage, in
        general, requires strong cooperation between cultural institutions and
        teachers. Cultural institutions “own” the artifacts and the scientific
        knowledge; teachers are in charge of the learning process. Technology can help
        in a number of ways to achieve a more symbiotic approach: it can make the
        learning process more effective; it can contribute to the fun and the hype, and
        therefore provide additional motivation to kids; and finally, it can generate
      “rewarding results” from an educational perspective.</p>
        <p class="AbstractText">The project <strong>Milano Romana Tecnologica</strong> (i.e., <em>Milan</em> at the time of the <em>Roman</em> Empire presented through <em>Technology</em>), was carried out by a classroom of 24 pupils (K5) in Milan, Italy. Children combined several activities in a period of 2 months: they visited the Archeological Museum in town; they searched for additional material on the Internet or in the school library; they shot pictures or made drawings when they could not find the proper visual documentation; they creating narratives; they recorded MP3 audios….and finally, they developed a “multichannel” hyperstory on Roman Milan, using “1001stories” (the instant multimedia engine that was presented at Museums and the Web 2007). The result is a pleasant and fresh interactive multimedia narrative which provides multiple reading paths and is delivered as Web Site, podcast and CD-ROM. A copy of the CD-ROM was given to the parents of each child.</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">The children had a lot of fun. According to
        their teachers, they not only got acquainted with multimedia technology, but
        also (and above all)  improved their knowledge and understanding of both Milan
        during the Roman period and more generally, Roman Civilization. Families were
        enthusiastic about the fact that their kids had done something previously
        considered beyond their capabilities (and they were also happy to receive the
        CD-ROM as a souvenir of that school year). The cultural institution (i.e., the
      Archeological Museum) was very happy to receive so much interest and attention.</p>

      <h1>1. Introduction and Social Context</h1>
      <p>Schools, especially  primary schools in Italy (K1 to
        K5), and Cultural Institutions (e.g., museums) more and more need to cooperate.
        As far as schools are concerned, there are at least two different motivations
      for this increasing interest toward cultural institutions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Schools are paying increased attention to promoting local culture in a
          more effective way.</li>
        <li>Schools are stepping up support for learning styles different from
          simply reading books; therefore, visiting museums, searching out materials,
          organizing activities around the exhibits, etc. are welcome, and more prominent
          activities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As far as Cultural Institutions are concerned,
      the following are a couple of motivations:</p>
      <ul> <li class="listwithbullets">For many of them, schools are, or are becoming, an important segment of
        their “market”. In many archeological museums in Italy, for example, the
      majority of visitors (especially in the morning) come in student groups.</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets">Strengthening ties with children, and generating in them interest in
        the institution, may trigger stronger ties with their families, and therefore
      promote a better sense of community (Werger 1999) .</li>
      </ul>
	 <p>Still, in this scenario there are also some
        problems. A visit to a museum does not
         <i>per se</i>necessarily create a deep impact on students. Teachers must organize activities
        before and after the visit: before, to prepare the children properly, and
        after, to consolidate the interest and knowledge generated during the visit.
        Cultural field trips, however, are often considered boring by the students and
        a distraction from the curriculum by their parents. In addition, the educational
        apparatus that is organized by a cultural institution around its collections or
        exhibitions may be at odds with or not easily integrated into the learning
      process organized at school.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we propose that technologies
        (e.g., Multimedia, Web, Search Engines, Podcasting.) can
      help in a number of ways:</p>
       <ul><li class="listwithbullets">They can be a basis for cultural heritage-oriented educational
        activities that seem interesting and “modern” to children who are surrounded by
        technology in their every day life and who easily find conventional museum
        exhibits or printed material on cultural heritage subjects too traditional and
      “old fashioned” (Ardito 2007).</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets">They can effectively support the integration of educational activities
        organized by cultural institutions and those carried on at school, providing
        stronger motivation for follow-up classroom activities that are crucial for
        consolidating the information and the stimuli derived from the on-site visit to
      a cultural institution.</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets">They can be used to generate “visible results” that are rewarding to
      children and well appreciated by their families.</li>
     </ul>
	 <p>In the rest of this paper, we discuss the
        lessons learned in a project carried on with twenty-four students aged 10-11 at
        a primary school in Milan. The children first experienced cultural heritage in
        a physical setting during a traditional visit to the Milan archeological museum
        and to the few Roman remains in our town. Then the children brought their
        experience into the classroom, extending and amplifying it by means of
        technology. They built a multichannel hyperstory around their physical
        experience of cultural heritage, exploiting Web resources, and, above all,
        created an on-line hyperstory using the authoring tool <b>1001stories</b>, which was developed at our lab and presented at MW2007. Our tool is
        briefly introduced in this paper, and the reader is referred to Bolchini 2007
        for details. Here, we focus on the activities carried on by the children during
        the project and discuss the outcomes from the perspectives of all involved
        stakeholders – children, teachers, families, and cultural heritage
      institutions.</p>
      <h1>2. A Hyperstory Authoring Tool: 1001stories</h1>
      <p>In general terms, “hyperstory” means
        “hypermedia story”; i.e., anything that has a non linear structure and
        encompasses an emotionally and symbolically charged discursive narrative to
        generate and sustain meaning (Antle 2003), (Benford 2000).
        A multi-channel hyperstory is a hyperstory which is delivered on different
      channels - in our case, Web, CD-ROM, and iPod.</p>
      <p><b>1001stories</b> (Bolchini 2007) can be defined as a <i>web-enabled</i> <i>application</i> <i>framework </i>(Garzotto 2005), (Samis 2004), (Schwabe 1999), for <i>multichannel</i> <i>hypermedia storytelling</i>. As such, it provides an application “skeleton” that
        captures the essential features of multichannel hyperstories and can be customized
      to produce a specific hyperstory. </p>
      <p><b>1001stories</b> does not
        intervene in the creative job of designing good narrative structures and
      building story contents. We rather address the process of </p>
      <ol>
        <li>translating conceptual narrative structures into a suitable interactive
          format; </li>
        <li>filling these structures with multimedia contents, and </li>
        <li>delivering the resulting hyperstory on different channels. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Our main purpose is to make this overall process as <i>simple,
        cheap, </i>and<i> fast</i> as possible. 1001 stories is fast to
        learn, quick to help authors complete a story, and easy to use, hiding the
        complexity of the underlying implementation. Everything - from building the
        narrative structures, to inserting or updating multimedia contents in the
        narrative units, to page publishing, to CD-ROM compilation, to podcasting - is
        intuitive and doable with few clicks. In addition, 1001stories is delivered
        together with a set of Guidelines that include a suggested <i>workflow </i>(i.e., a<i> </i>structured collection of activities for  building a
        hyperstory in an efficient way), and a set of <i>content production
      suggestions </i>for the development team.</p>
      <p>The information architecture of our hyperstories is a simple <i>tree-like structure </i>composed of a <i>predefined
        set of node types </i>(see figure 1). The node types are <i>Cover</i>, which acts as “Home” and introduces the story; <i>Ancillary
          Information, </i>which<i> </i>may
        contain arbitrary information about the story ( e.g., about author(s), the
        development team, institution or company or organization,
        sponsors, credits, acknowledgments, etc.); <i>Story Topic</i> (<i>Topic</i> for short), which represents a
        “piece of a story” of any semantic nature, depending on the application domain
        (e.g., describing facts, persons, characters, events, anecdotes, places,
        objects …); and <i>Story subtopic</i> (<i>Subtopic</i> for short), which denotes a sub-subject of the related topic. The
        content format of each node type is pre-defined for each delivery channel. On
        the stationary channel, for example, a Topic or a Sub-Topic is composed (see
        figure 2) of a title, a subtitle, a descriptive text, an audio narrative, and a
        dynamic visual media object – a sequence of images, a (2D or 3D) video,
        or an animation – synchronized with the audio narrative. The audio and
        the dynamic media start playing automatically when a user enters the corresponding
      Topic or Subtopic.</p>
      <p>For the last generation of iPod, a Topic or
        Subtopic is a “movie”; i.e., a video + audio unit, while for previous iPod versions or for other MP3 players, we support the creation of
      audio-only hyperstories.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a><a href="garzotto-fig1.html"><img src="GARZOTTO-FIGURE1.jpg" alt="figure 1" width="400" height="151"/></a></p>

      hyperstory (on Web or CD-ROM)</a></p>
      <p>Navigation links exploit three navigation patterns (Garzotto 1999):</p>
       <ul><li class="listwithbullets"><i>Index </i>(from<i> </i>a node to each node in a group of nodes, and back)</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets"><i>GuidedTour </i>(sequential bidirectional navigation)</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets"><i>Automatic
        Guided Tour </i>(forward sequential navigation
        in which the activation of the “next” link is triggered automatically by the
        system)<i>. </i>In our design,
      next-link automatic traversing is triggered by the end of the sound comment. </li>
    </ul>
  <p>On the Web and CD-ROM versions of the story,
        all the above navigation patterns are combined to support different navigation
        ‘styles’: <i>manual navigation, automatic-short navigation, automatic-long
          navigation. </i>In manual navigation, the user is in
        control of the navigation, and can traverse all index links or guided tour
        links available in a node. Automatic-short and automatic-long navigation exploit
        the automatic guided tour patterns respectively among Topics, and among Topics <i>and</i> Subtopics. In automatic-<i>short</i> navigation,
        the system takes the user from Topic to Topic, triggering the next Topic when
        the audio narrative of the current node is over. The user can remain passive,
        listen to the audio narrative, watch the animation, read the textual narration,
        and enjoy the story flow from topic to topic (still with the possibility of
        suspending and re-activating it at any time). In automatic-<i>long</i> navigation, the paradigm is the same, but the narrative flow now
        traverses the linearization of the Topic-Subtopic tree structure: the system
        takes the user from a Topic to the first Subtopic, from here to the next
        Subtopic, from the last Subtopic to the next Topic, and so on. To make the
        experience more engaging and customized to the actual user’s needs, the
        navigation style is <i>adaptable:</i> users can <i>select
          the most appropriate navigation style</i> according to
      their preferences (and modify that choice at any time) - see figure 3. </p>

      <p class="caption"><a href="garzotto-fig3.html">Fig 3: Cover Page of a Hyperstory – navigation style
      control buttons</a></p>
      <p>Hyperstories on the iPod (figure 4) device are <i>views</i> of their counterparts on stationary
        environments that customize both content and navigation structures according to
      the display and interaction capability of the delivery platform. </p>

      visit</a></p>
      <p>Navigation is based on index and automatic
        navigation patterns only, and a hyperstory is shaped as a set of <i>video
          play-lists; </i>i.e.,<i> </i>sequences
        of (video +) audio<i> </i>items that<i> </i>are (dis)played automatically one after the other as the play-list is
      activated by the user (see figure 5). </p>

      <p class="caption"><a href="garzotto-fig6.html">Fig 6: Hyperstory structure on the iPod</a></p>
      <p>A very friendly interface - see figure 7 - supports the
      access to and the use of the following functional components: <i>Data</i> <i>Entry, Previewer, </i>and <i>Multi-delivery Generator</i>.</p>
      <p>The <i>Data Entry</i> is a
        simple control panel enabling the user to edit the <i>editorial plan</i> of the story (i.e., to decide the Topics and
        Subtopics of the story), to enter content for each element (i.e. title, text,
        images with captions and audio file), and to perform all needed changes (see
        figure 7). The physical creation of multimedia
        content pieces (e.g., images, videos, sounds, descriptions) takes place outside
      the <i>1001Stories</i> framework, using appropriate multimedia authoring tools.</p>
      <p>At any moment during the development process, the <i>Preview</i> allows developers to visualize what has been
        produced so far, as it will appear to the end user. In this way, the developer
        can immediately check the quality of the work (e.g. the impact of the content,
        or the graphics) and make any desired improvements. In
        situations of collaborative authoring, the Previewer facilitates the creation
        of a shared understanding within a development team of what is achievable, and
      of the impact of different authoring choices.</p>
      <p>The <i>Generator</i> produces and publishes the final applications (for the different delivery
      channels), once every element of the story has been set and specified.</p>

      <h1 style="text-align:justify">3. The Learning Process</h1>
      <p>Roman civilization is a key topic in the program of the last
        year of Italian primary school. To anchor children’s understanding of this
        broad subject to something more “tangible” and closer to their experience, the
        theme for our project’s hyperstory was focused on Milan during the Roman Age.
        Indeed, Milan was one of the capitals of the Roman Empire (Second and Third
        centuries A.D.), and a few remains are still visible in town (a tower from the
        circus is embedded within the Archeological Museum) and/or are exhibited at the
        Archeological Museum. The hyperstory was therefore titled “Milano
        Romana Tecnologica” (i.e., “<i>Milan</i> at the time of
      the <i>Roman</i> Empire presented through <i>Technology</i>) - hereafter called “Roman Milan” </p>
      <p>The activities of the class were organized in four major
      phases:</p>
     <ul> <li class="listwithbullets">In-the
      field cultural heritage experience of Roman Milan</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets">Traditional
      classroom work.</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets">Technological
      Training</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets">Development
      of the Hyper-story.</li>
     </ul>
	 <h2>In-The-Field Experience And Classroom Work</h2>
      <p>The teachers organized a one-day school trip during which
        children were exposed to cultural heritage in a &#34;traditional
        way&#34;. They visited a cultural institution (the Civic Archeological
        Museum), underground or outdoor (few) remains of Roman Milan in different
        quarters of the town, and areas where no ruin is visible today, but that hosted
        important places of cult or public life during the Roman period (e.g., the huge
        thermal baths were in an area where a subterranean garage is located today).
        They also walked around the downtown streets where the
        structure of the Roman streets (“cardo” and “decumanano” maximo) still emerges
        from the modern urban texture. In this way, learning about Ancient Romans in
        general, and Roman Milan in particular, was “situated” i.e., anchored in
        a context that was meaningful to the children. During the trip, they took many
        pictures (figure 8) and collected printed material; e.g., postcards and
      booklets at the museum. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig8" id="fig8"></a><a href="garzotto-fig8.html"><img src="GARZOTTO-FIGURE8.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="400" height="533"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="garzotto-fig8.html">Fig 8: Taking pictures of the statue representing Emperor
      Costantino</a></p>
      <p>To consolidate the children’s understanding of what they had
        seen, teachers proposed conventional classroom activities back at school; such
        as group discussions, study using school books and the printed material
        collected at the museum, and creation of short individual narratives about the
      trip.</p>
      <h2>Technological Training</h2>
      <p>Afterwards, a team from HOC-LAB helped children (and
        teachers) to understand the characteristics of the product they were expected
        to create with technology, and to build the (limited) technological skills
      needed to use 1001stories to create multimedia contents. </p>
      <p>Working in small groups in the school computer lab, the
        children practised with image scanning and manipulation, digital sound
        recording, file system organization, image import from digital camera, and
        on-line search engines. In order to better understand the content organization
        and the navigation-interaction paradigms of our hyperstories, the children
        explored examples of existing hyperstories. Finally, children and teachers
      learned how to use the 1001stories authoring tool. </p>
      <p>We were confident of the easy-to-learn quality of the tool,
        but still were surprised by the fact that, after a brief explanation of the
        main operations, the average learning time was 17 minutes, with a 12-minute
      record and a 26-minute worst case.</p>
      <h2>Development of the Hyperstory</h2>
      <p>For the hyperstory development process, the children were
        organized into groups of  three, where the different technological skills were
      blended.</p>
      <p>Before breaking to start work, the whole class discussed the
        choices of Topics, and they came up with the following list: “Milano
        Becomes the Capital of the Roman Empire”, “The Archeological Museum”, “The
        Forum”, “The Theatre”, “The Streets”, “The Thermal Baths”, “The Circus”, “The
      Amphitheater”, and “Saint Lawrence Basilica”.</p>
      <p>After the assignment of one Topic per group,
        the children started the hyperstory production work (Figures
        9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15). They integrated the material
        collected during the on-site trip with textual and visual contents retrieved
        from the Web (using a search engine) and from school library books, and with
        their own drawings (the latter, as discussed later, was their own innovative
        idea). They scanned the printed material and imported pictures from their
        cameras. They wrote the narrative texts and recorded their readings of the
        different narratives. Tasks like the identification of what to do and the
        execution of the different tasks were interspersed with discussion and
        brainstorming - within the group, among groups, and with the teachers. They made
        a number of revisions during the production process, and did
      final quality checks before delivering the final version <span class="NeedsAttention">(available on: <a href="http://www.policultura.it/kids.htm">http://www.policultura.it/kids.htm</a>). </span></p>

      <p>The children gave a very creative contribution to the
        “design of the experience”, proposing original ways of carrying on the workflow
        as we originally conceived it in our “Guidelines” for 1001stories, and
        introducing <i>new</i> activities with and
        without technology that our design team had not experimented with in our
      previous projects. </p>
      <p>During the content production phase, for example, it was the
        children’s idea to create drawings to complement the existing material, and
      they spent a significant amount of time in this work (Figures 11 and 12). </p>

      <p>Another of the children’s ideas concerns the use of
        “tangible” tools to brainstorm on and to specify the editorial “plan”; i.e.,
        the structure of Topics and Subtopics. Differently from what we observed in
        adults or older students, who typically build the editorial plan directly on
        the computer, these children decided to use a paper poster and a set of
        post-its of different sizes and colors - big light blue post-its to represented
        a Topic (e.g., “The Terms”) and smaller yellow post-its to represent a Subtopic
        (e.g., “What Romans used to do at the Terms”), as shown in figure 13. They
        collaboratively created different versions of the poster, including the
        proposals from the different groups. During this dynamic “brainstorming” work,
        children, teachers, and our design team engaged in
        discussions/critiques/reflections on the various solutions, adding, moving, and
        removing post-its to define the topics and subtopics and the proper order among
      them, truly collaborating and elaborating on one another’s ideas. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig13" id="fig13"></a><a href="garzotto-fig13.html"><img src="GARZOTTO-FIGURE13.jpg" alt="Figure 13" width="400" height="300"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="garzotto-fig13.html">Fig 13: Creating the editorial plan</a></p>
      <p>Furthermore, the children found a way to <i>engage their families
        in the project: </i>they asked parents to visit
        Milan Roman with them <i>together</i> during the weekend, since they wanted to refresh their memories of the various
        places (they wanted to be sure of what they were writing in their narratives!)
        and to take further pictures of places and monuments related to the Roman
      period. </p>
      <p>Finally, the children contributed to identifying patterns of
        teamwork. Even when each group was responsible for a specific topic and each
        member of a group for a specific subtopic, the overall process was <i>strongly
          collaborative</i>, both within and among
        groups. The allocation of tasks within a group was based on different criteria.
        In some cases, children distributed the work according to the nature of the
        contents: some children focused more on visual material, others on textual
        contents. In other cases, the criterion was task-oriented: some children were
        devoted to content <i>search</i> (on the
        Internet or in books); others to drawing; and still others to content
        digitalization. An original example of within-group collaboration concerns the
        creation of audio. In our previous 1001story experiences, involving only adults
        or high school students, hyperstory developers typically allocated a single
        speaker the task of reading an entire topic or subtopic. In contrast, these
        children decided to split each single narrative into pieces, and to assign the
        reading and audio recording of each piece to a different group member. This
        solution was particularly time-consuming. Children read and read again each
        topic or subtopic before being satisfied with the voice and tone of all actors,
        and spent quite a lot of effort merging the pieces into a single audio track
        (see figure 14). Still, the final effect was very nice, and much more engaging
      than having just one speaker. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig14" id="fig14"></a><a href="garzotto-fig14.html"><img src="GARZOTTO-FIGURE14.jpg" alt="Figure 14" width="400" height="300"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="garzotto-fig14.html">Fig 14: Collaborative audio-recording </a></p>
      <p>Inter-group collaboration occurred during the whole
        development cycle, much more intensively than we expected. We initially
        configured the tool in “individual-view” mode, so that each user could see and
        update only his group’s portion of the story (i.e., his group’s topic and
        subtopics). We planned to offer the shared view mode – which allows all
        users to see and update all topics and subtopics - only at the end, to avoid
        having any  child intentionally or unintentionally destroy another’s work. It
        turned out that the children wanted to see what the others were doing right
        from the very beginning, to compare their group’s progress  with the other
        groups, and to share visual material among groups. Thus, after a couple of
        sessions, we provided the shared-view mode for all groups, to support
      inter-group collaboration. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig15" id="fig15"></a><a href="garzotto-fig15.html"><img src="GARZOTTO-FIGURE15.JPG" alt="Figure 15" width="400" height="320"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="garzotto-fig15.html">Fig 15: Collaborative Quality Check</a></p>
      <p>When the last subtopic was finally composed and revised, and
        a preview of the entire hyperstory was generated, the design team expected to
        be finished, but we were wrong. The children were so engaged in the project, so
        excited about their story, and so conscious of the value of their experience,
        that they decided to do some extra work: to tell “their” story of the whole
        process, and to add it as a new Topic in their hyperstory. To describe this new
        Topic, they adopted an original metaphor, presenting the project work as a
        cookbook recipe – the “Milan Roman” digital meal (see figure 16). The
        content resources needed for the hyperstory were introduced as “ingredients”
        for the recipe, and the needed activities as to-do steps to prepare and cook
        “Milan Roman”. They decided that the Sub-Topics of the new Topic should
        describe each group’s “views” of the project. These narratives highlight the
        children’s <i>emotional</i> perception of the
        experience. Some groups narrated, for example, how surprised they were to
        discover the hidden past of their town, and how much they liked to show their
        story on the Internet to their family. Other children invented rhymes or funny
        songs to describe their feelings. All groups also took new pictures and created
        new drawings for describing themselves, their group, and their work for the
      purpose of this new section (figures 16 and 17).</p>

      <h1 style="text-align:justify">Satisfaction and Educational
      Benefits for Children, Families, and Teachers</h1>
      <p>All the children enormously enjoyed the
        overall experience. They were enthusiastic about the work, and in some cases
        “forced” the teachers to bring them to the computer lab  outside the scheduled
        sessions. They always asked about &#34;doing more&#34;. To assess
        satisfaction, as well as qualitative observations we used (very carefully) a
        small questionnaire: 90% of the kids gave the maximum score (“Very much”) to
        the question: “How much did you like the project?” and only 10% scored it “It
        was ok”. In addition, a good  number of the free comments were quite
        enthusiastic (<i>“I would like to do it again!!!</i>” <i>“I wish I had it </i>[the
      tool]<i> at home thus I could continue my work there!</i>”). </p>
      <p>From an educational perspective, we achieved a number of 
        benefits. Obviously, children learned about technology. They
        became naturally and very playfully familiar with a number
        of basic Web and multimedia technologies. Since the teachers were not very
        familiar with computers, in most cases children had to &#34;teach their
      teachers&#34; and to explain the different operations to them. </p>
      <p>But the children also improved their
        knowledge, attitudes, and skills to different levels (Bloom 1964). Having a
        special purpose while visiting the museum, they paid much more attention than
        usual, and learned more from their on-site exposure to cultural heritage. The
        need to organize a narrative within a strict format forced the children to work
        cooperatively, in order to define the conceptual structure, to prioritize items
        and to synthesize material. This was beneficial both for better understanding
        the subject matter and for acquiring and/or developing a number of skills (e.g.
      group work, narrative organization....). </p>
      <p><i>Teachers </i>estimated
        that the experience induced<i> much higher achievement </i>of the above<i> learning benefits</i>, when compared with conventional activities carried
        on at school to address similar learning goals. Teachers were
        skeptical at the beginning, but became progressively more and more
        enthusiastic. They advertised the project within the school in such an positive
        way that this year, four different classes from the same
        institute wanted to participate in the project; and our team is currently
        working with over ninety students aged 9-11 on different themes related to
      Milan’s cultural heritage. </p>
      <p>Finally, parents were also quite enthusiastic,
        surprised, and very proud of their children  when they realized that their kids
      were so involved, and when they received the final production as a CD-ROM.</p>
      <h1 style="text-align:justify">4. Conclusions</h1>
      <p>At first sight, the experience of the Roman Milan project may look similar to other experiences of
        producing digital content. However, there are some specific aspects to be
      considered:</p>
       <ul>
		<li class="listwithbullets">The strictly technological activities were not the ones requiring the
        most effort.  Understanding the historical and cultural issues, developing a
        body of knowledge and relating it to a physical experience, organizing content,
        synthesizing concepts, finding or creating information resources – these
      were the main concerns.</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets">The (very synthetic) format of <b>1001stories’</b> hyperstories forces children to express themselves with a few words, and
      therefore to focus on what they have really understood.</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets">When children visited the Museum and then went around the city
        listening to the tour guide and shooting pictures, they had a special purpose
      and therefore were very excited and motivated.</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets">The cultural value (in a strict sense) of the production is negligible,
        as is always true for productions from school. It has, however, a flavor of
        “freshness,” and is a pleasant souvenir of something that involved a museum and
      a class of children (using their faces and their voices).</li>
</ul>
      <p>From a Cultural Heritage point of view, we see
      a number of positive effects of the approach pursued by our project:</p>
       <ul>
		<li class="listwithbullets">The visit to the museum was considered by the children a <i>special</i> event, something that they still remember (after one year) – 
        not the standard reaction to conventional exposure to cultural heritage; i.e.,
      visits to cultural institutions.</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets">The subject matter was well internalized by the children. An informal
        test we used  with a group of project participants highlights that after one
      year, they still remember most of the content used to create Roman Milan.</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets">Families became engaged in what was happening, and as a consequence,
        became interested in the subject; i.e. Milan at the time of the Roman Empire.
        Some families were “forced” by their kids to visit the Archeological Museum and
        different Roman places in town. As this museum is quite small, it was
        unfamiliar to most parents, who visited it for the first time when they were
      brought by their children.</li>
      <li class="listwithbullets">The museum received special attention from the teachers, and teachers
      rated it highly among other teaching experiences.</li>
      </ul>
	<p>Will the families be better visitors of the
        museum? Will the children become frequent visitors of the museum once adults?
        Will their interest in antiquity remain when they  grow?
      Will the school maintain stronger ties with the museum in the future?</p>
      <p>We can’t honestly answer all these questions;
        also, we are fully aware that we cannot easily generalize from just one
        experience. Since, however, we have a strong feeling (and some evidence) that <b>something
          interesting happened</b>, we have started a number of
        initiatives following this first attempt. First of all, we opened our competition “POLICULTURA” (from the Greek πολύ <i>= </i>&#34;many&#34;, and the Italian
        “cultura” = “culture”), to primary schools (in the previous edition, it was
        reserved for high schools). The POLICULTURA competition asks schools at all
        levels - from primary to high schools - to use the 1001stories tool to create
        hyperstories similar to Roman Milan. By  the end of January 2008, we had more
        than 200 classes registered, from all Italian regions - almost 4000 students
        involved – and 50% of the schools are primary. This is an interesting
      result on its own.</p>
      <p>As we mentioned earlier, we are repeating an
        experience similar to Roman Milan with four more classes in the same school
        whose students volunteered to participate. The themes will include ‘Renaissance
        Art in Milan’,and ‘The Navigli Old District’. This time
        the monitoring of the impact from a Cultural Heritage point of view will be
        more systematic and more quantitative. We will try to better understand the
        cultural impact on children, teachers and family, and we will also organize a
        monitoring “one year later” study to verify what learning survives over time.
        We hope that in a reasonable amount of time (let’s say for the next school
        year) we will be able to come up with a complete “package”, including <b>1001stories,</b> a model of project organization, tips about what to do and not to do,
        in order to offer to Cultural Institutions and schools technological and
      methodological tools for  more effective cooperation.</p>
