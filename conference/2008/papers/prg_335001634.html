        <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText">At a
        time when both museum visitation and art-based, K-12 curricula are on the
        decline, some art museums are turning to new and innovative storytelling
        programs to engage visitors and instruct students. Combining visitor-created
        narratives and literacy education programs, museums are enticing visitors to
        experience their collections through the power of storytelling.  </p>
        <p class="AbstractText"> This paper will explore a variety of programs, from larger-scale literacy
        program partnerships between public school systems and prominent art museums to
        smaller, more unconventional programs at a series of other museums. While some
        of these programs are more conventional in nature, a few employ both on-line
        and handheld technologies to facilitate visitor storytelling, enriching and
        extending their museum experiences. Allowed to create and share their own
        stories alongside the authoritative museum narrative, visitors come away with a
        more vibrant, engaging and inspired experience. In greater depth, we will
      explore the case study of the <i>Art of Storytelling</i> project at the Delaware Art Museum. </p>
        <p class="AbstractText">Our
        evaluation addresses both the impacts of both the original storytelling experience
        on the participants, and the educational activity on students, the results of
      which are further explored in this paper. </p>

      <h1>Introduction </h1>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I had to detach myself from old habits
        and learn a new paradigm, one that put people ahead of art, one that focused on
      enabling not just engaging people <br/>
      (Yenawine, 1999, 11).</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In this paper we discuss the integration of
        visitor-contributed narratives into the narratives of art museums, within both
        curatorial and educational programs. We begin with a discussion of the goals of
        one particular project, the Art of Storytelling, a project that explores the parallels
          between visual and literary composition by encouraging visitors to compose
          creative stories inspired by works in the museum. Then we briefly touch
          on what we would describe as key factors in the success of such projects. We
          explore the motivations behind allowing visitors to contribute, drawing on a
          theoretical foundation that allows us to position visitor-contributed narrative
          as a valid articulation of the underlying goals for art museums. We then
          attempt to profile the current landscape of visitor-contributed narrative
          programs, drawing from evaluations of programs at a handful of art museums
          across the country. From this context we delve into a deeper examination of the <i>Art of Storytelling</i> project,
            beginning with a brief project narrative. This two-part project includes a curated
              selection of original visitor stories available via a podcast tour and an
              interactive kiosk activity in which visitors arrange original compositions
              drawing from museum works and record an original story about their work. This
              is followed by a description of and the results from our own modest evaluation
      of this project. We end with some additional insights we have gleaned. </p>
      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Over a year has passed since the completion of
        the first phase of the <i>Art of Storytelling </i>project, in which visitors to the Delaware Art
          Museum, both on-line and off, crafted original stories inspired by objects in
          the museum. In that time much debate in the museum field has occurred regarding
          the value –  to the
          contributors, the museum itself and to the museum visitor community as a whole
          - of such visitor-contributed content projects. The verdict, from our vantage
          point, while still out in some respects, is overwhelmingly positive. Chiefly,
          in addressing the educational value – both cognitive and affective
        – to participants in such projects, we have found, like others before us
          (identified later in this paper), that projects evoking visitor storytelling
          are effective ways to engage visitors in thinking critically and creatively
          about, and responding to, art. Secondarily, these programs seem to benefit
          museums by both reaching out to and impacting new audiences, as well as by
          providing a potentially valuable feedback conduit with their audiences. In the
          third area of study – addressing the impact these programs have on the
          larger visitor audience – we have found intriguing, but inconclusive,
          results. On the one hand, some visitors have found the contributed content of other
          visitors inspirational, both enriching their museum experience and emboldening
          them to contribute in their own voices. On the other hand, other visitors have
          found the contributions of their fellow visitors outside their expectations,
          inappropriate, or even, simply, uninteresting. Additionally, a number of the
          programs launched by museums to encourage and enable visitors to contribute
          on-line have received lackluster participation. Do visitors see the museum’s
          carefully-crafted, expert panoply of voices as a place where their own voices
          would be vital, meaningful additions? Moreover, do visitors foster an interest
          in making those contributions, rather than simply relying on the museums to
          provide narrative insights? Our experience suggests “Yes” and “yes”, though not
      without a few important qualifications, outlined here.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">First, not all museums, collections or
        exhibitions are deemed appropriate for or appealing to visitors as an
        opportunity to contribute. As Matthew MacArthur of the Smithsonian’s Museum of
      American History points out:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">My
        staff and I were talking to a group of interns here at the museum, explaining
        our program which oversees the Web site. We thought it would be good
        opportunity to toss around some ideas for the future of the site with this
        group of young, smart students who undoubtedly all had their own Facebook
        profiles and were otherwise immersed in the world of Web 2.0. However, when it
        came to notions of user-contributed content on the site, all we got were blank
        stares. A few of them explained to us that as users, they would be looking for
        authoritative information from the Smithsonian, not input from other users or
        opportunities to participate. This group of aspiring museum professionals may
      not be a representative sample, but it definitely provided food for thought. (MacArthur, 2007, <a href="http://museumsremixed.blogspot.com/">http://museumsremixed.blogspot.com/</a>) </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">While the museum of reference was not an art
        museum, this concept of the museum providing a single, authoritative narrative
        regarding its collections, clearly shared by many in the art museum community,
        echoes a long-standing (and some would argue out-dated) model. On the other
        hand, the Smithsonian Photography Initiative recently completed a popular
        visitor-contributed photography project, on the heels of which they will be
        launching a visitor-contributed narrative project this summer; so the
        Smithsonian Institution, while authoritative and off-limits to some visitors,
      is a fertile environment for sharing to others.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">We found the visitors of the Delaware Art Museum
        (investigated in greater depth in a later section of this paper) eager to
        participate in our storytelling project, with over 350 visitor stories gathered
        in less than six weeks. Many of the other projects outlined in this paper also
        show visitors contributing enthusiastically to museum narratives. So what does
        this mean? It is impossible to say with any certainty which museums,
        collections and exhibits are most appropriate for visitors’ contributions.
        Museum professionals must identify these themselves. We can say that in looking
        at our data we found visitors most likely to write stories about late 19<sup>th</sup> century illustrative, 20<sup>th</sup> century modern, and contemporary works,
        with which they were probably more familiar, both experientially and
        culturally, than about pre-Raphaelite and 19<sup>th</sup> century American art.
        This seems to echo what we already know: that people – visitors or not
        – are more likely to be inspired by and speak about what they know than
      what is archaic or alien to their experience. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"> Nowhere is this better exemplified than in one of the most
        popular visitor-contributed on-line projects we know: the Victoria &amp;
      Albert’s one day project <i>Tattoo: A Day of Record</i> (<a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/tattoo/search/Blue/Introduction.htm">http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/tattoo/search/Blue/Introduction.htm</a>). </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">About 1500 people came to the museum to document
        their tattoos, or more importantly, to have their tattoos displayed on the
        museum’s Web site. Identifying and providing relevant access points to your
        collections to enable visitors to contribute is a key factor in eliciting their
        involvement. In our case, it was a creative writing exercise that carries with
      it its own interest and audience.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="fisherfig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="118"/></p>
      <p class="MsoCaption"><span class="caption">Fig
        1: Left: The most stories were written about Marooned, Howard Pyle, 1909, oil
        on canvas. Right: The fewest stories were written about The Return of Tobias,
      Benjamin West, 1803, oil on canvas</span>.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In the past few years a number of art museums
        have introduced to their Web site visitors the capacity to create their own
        personal collections on-line. Some museums have even introduced additional
        features, allowing visitors to curate these collections with text and even
        audio, send them to friends, and even submit them to be viewed by other
        visitors. Unfortunately, many of these museums have been disappointed with the
        lack of visitor participation. Beyond a small group of technologists and
        intrepid educators, these visitor collection features often go unused. Some
        critics point to such failed attempts to engage visitor participation as
        further evidence that visitors are only interested in reaping the benefits of
        museum experiences, not contributing to them. We would disagree. But clearly a
        lesson can be learned from such lackluster participation. First off, it should
        be understood that this behavior, in which only the few are active contributors
        and the majority are passive visitors, is mirrored across the Internet on most
        user-contributed Web sites. Therefore it is best to structure projects such
        that visitors (and the project, for that matter) are not penalized for
        non-participation, but instead are able to enjoy, and perhaps be inspired by,
      the contributions of others.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Tied to this concept is the important factor of
        visitor <i>motivation</i>. In order to
          successfully garner visitor contributions, the museum must both remove barriers
          to entry and provide motivational factors. As will later be explored, the
          Denver Art Museum found that visitors were more likely to participate in a
          gallery-based narrative exercise when a curator was present, encouraging them
          to do so. Alternately, they found that visitors wanted clearer indications that
          their participation was invited. As we well know, museums asking visitors to
          contribute their own voices, especially in a creative capacity, is a relatively
          new concept, and in many ways directly counters visitor expectations – so
      inviting contributions loudly and clearly is the best approach. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In the case of the <i>Art of Storytelling</i>, we set up a Web site completely independent of the
        museum site, giving the project its own identity outside of the traditional
        Delaware Art Museum context. While we cannot say for certain if this was a
        success factor, we believe it didn’t hurt. More importantly, as a juried
        exhibition, selected storytellers were given a $250 stipend and had their
        stories professionally recorded for a museum podcast. Both were strong
        motivators, we believe. At the Denver Art Museum, visitors seemed to appreciate
        the ability to read each other’s narratives before contributing their own.
        While this was not evaluated as a factor in visitor motivation, it parallels
        user behaviors on Internet-based social media Web sites. People are not only
        more likely to go where others have gone before them, but are also more likely
        to perceive the value of doing so if they gain value from the contributions of
      others. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">On the other hand, Web sites requiring logins to
        allow visitors to contribute, and other visitors to experience their narratives,
        establish barriers to entry. One exceedingly creative yet perhaps overly
        ambitious project by artist Flavia Da Rin at the Speed museum involves the
        following: Visitors must identify local billboards by the artist and enter an
        associated text SMS code to access a project site: http://<a href="http://www.ispyspeed.com/">www.ispyspeed.com</a>. Only then
          do they read the contest rules: “Find the billboards and text each keyword to
          55022. After each text you will receive a reply - each reply message will give
          you a codeword. Enter the codeword here to unlock the billboard image you
          found. When you&#39;ve found 5 billboards, you can begin to upload your own
          billboard designs!” (http://<a href="http://www.ispyspeed.com/">www.ispyspeed.com</a>) Visitors
            presumably then vote on their favorite billboard designs, and from these a
            winner is chosen. “The design entry with the most votes will be exhibited as a
            billboard outside the Speed Art Museum during the month of March 2008.”
          (http://<a href="http://www.ispyspeed.com/">www.ispyspeed.com</a>) When we
              visited this site in January of 2008 with only weeks left in the project, there
              was only one visitor-contributed design to be voted on, and it had only two
              votes. While we cannot comment on the overall effectiveness of this project at
              this time, we will point out that the barriers to entry were formidable. And
              while the overall concept included an aspect of mystery and thrill that might
              appeal to some visitors, we believe the majority find the process cumbersome to
              say the least, and will not be bothered. Of course this is not a visitor
              narrative project <i>per se</i>, but a project
                that requires visitors to contribute creatively to the museum experience. We
                would argue that it is the museum, as much as the visitor (if not more so), who
                is privileged to receive the type of creative, thoughtful participation
                required. In order to motivate visitors to take part, the museum should make
      participation as simple, and rewarding, as possible.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">While we upbraid the Speed Museum project as
        lacking in one of the key characteristics of success, we equally applaud the
        project for exploiting two other key success factors – <i>promotion</i> and <i>audience</i>. The Speed project was self-promoted by design,
          through the use of a series of billboards throughout the city of Louisville,
          tantalizing the populace with compelling works of art. This alone garnered a
          host of local press articles highlighting the project. In the case of the <i>Art
            of Storytelling</i> project, the
              uniqueness of the program and the nature of  public participation led to write-ups in the major local
              paper, a radio story on a local NPR-affiliate, and mentions on various
              storytelling and creative writing newsletters and blogs. These outlets, some customary
              for the museum and some not, were vital in positioning the project and
      attracting participants. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Equally compelling (in our eyes) is the Speed
        Museum’s grand prize for the winning participant - having his or her creative
        work exhibited on a billboard outside the museum. This prestigious positioning
        for a local visual artist is a compelling accolade. Establishing an audience
        for your visitor-contributors provides them with something unique and otherwise
        unobtainable: affiliation with an esteemed institution, however mitigated by
        the guidelines of participation, is coveted by many. If, as so many on-line
        user-contributed Web sites have found, an active community built around the
        project can be established, the opportunities compound. But one danger we would
        identify is that many well-funded commercial on-line communities are vying for
        on-line visitors’ participation and time, so any expectations of developing
        thriving communities around your institution’s goals should be considered
        carefully. We would argue that the primary value that most art museums have to
        offer is in the connection that can be made by visitors to and around
        collections, not in fostering robust on-line communities beyond their
        collections. In the case of the <i>Art of Storytelling</i> project, winning stories selected out of our open call
          for submissions were included on the Web site and on a podcast tour of the
          museum. These venues, while they seemed to provide a compelling motivator to
          storytellers, are yet to be proven valuable to visitor audiences. Our initial
          attempts, as outlined in this paper, were encouraging in places, disheartening
          in others, and ultimately inconclusive. The fact remains that establishing a
          compelling audience for visitor-contributed content, an audience that
          appreciate this content and find their experience enriched by it, is a crucial
      factor in the formula for success. </p>

      <h1>Why
      Enable Visitors To Contribute?</h1>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">For readers acquainted with our Museums and the
        Web paper last year expansively entitled <i>Remixing Exhibits: Constructing
          Participatory Narratives With On-Line Tools To Augment Museum Experiences</i>, or who have read Hilde Hein’s book <i>Public
            Art: Thinking Museums Differently</i>,
              this portion of our paper may be familiar terrain. But we include it here
              because we recognize that many museums, art museums often chief among them,
              remain skeptical regarding the value of visitors’ contributions to their
              experience. Many feel that it is the museum’s primary (perhaps sole)
              responsibility to engage visitors with, and inform them about, their
              collections, through compelling, authoritative narratives. And that this is,
              indeed, what their visitors expect and require. This debate, summarized nicely
              in <i>Public Art</i> by contrasting
      the philosophies of two vastly different museum directors, is as follows: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Alfred
        Barr, the first director of the New York Museum of Modern Art, had a vision of
        its collection as a single, complex, but coherent and longitudinal (i.e., art
        historically conceived) work of art that articulates modernism with impeccable,
        single-minded artistry. Julian Spalding, former director of the Glasgow Museums
        and Art Galleries, holds that museums should not tell one history but rather facilitate
        many concurrent stories. In his book <i>The Poetic Museum</i>, he proposes that the museum be
          something like a self-generated poetry anthology, permissively equipped with
          stimulating artifactual props… [He] encourages visitor/curator collaboration in
      the re-imagining of exhibits. (Hein 2006, 110)</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">It is clear from the introductory passage to
      Hein’s book, which of these philosophies she embraces:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">I
        was one of the thousands of people drawn to New York by the Christo Gates
        project in February 2005… When a friend asked me afterwards what I thought of
        The Gates, I began by telling her about the light, air, sound, and color; the
        breeze; the cheerful people wearing saffron accessories; dogs in fashionable
        vests; children in strollers; bicycles… “But you’re telling me about everything
        else. What about the art?” “That is the art,” I answered. The art is its
        gestation, history the public it gathers and reactions it evokes, and the
      memories it leaves behind. It is a process, not a thing. (Hein 2006, xvii) </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">With this passage Hilde Hein ushers in the
        conceptual framework for her book. While here she speaks of public art, Hein
        moves on to apply public art as a viable model for museums. To do so, she
        begins by making the critical distinction that public art in its optimal form
        is characterized by the process, the reactions, the memories, of the public,
        rather than the objects themselves. She goes on to define the role of public
      artists: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Today’s
        public artists incline to replace answers with questions. They seek to advance
        debate and discussion. Their art is left open-ended and invites participation.
        Its orientation is toward process and change rather than material stability.
        Since its borders are indefinite, so is its authorship. (Hein 2006,
      76) </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">She then offers up this conceptual model of
        public art for museums to consider. It is a model in which objects are still
        central, as they (more so than the narratives around them) have the capacity to
        evoke the “museal gaze…the gaze that endows the object with its aura [and]
        ‘‘revokes the disenchantment of the world.’” (2006,118) This somewhat lofty view
        of museum objects is one which many of us share, yet often struggle to inspire
      in our visitors. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In her public art model for museums, Hein
        provides the conceptualization of the museum <i>itself</i> as public art, in which questions of authorship and
      participation are raised rather than answered. In <i>Public Art</i>, Hein states: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">I
        explore the affinity between museums and public art. I argue that museums are
        changing more ponderously and with less clarity of purpose but in a direction
        similar to that of public art. Most notably, I see both as actors that no
        longer presume a ready-made audience with a more or less fixed disposition.
        Rather, they set out to construct multiple publics of limited duration and
      variable character. (Hein 2006, xiii) </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In her model, objects inspire and narratives are
        fluid and collaborative, drawing from the museum, the curators and the
        visitors. In this, the museum is “‘‘the controlling intermediary who sets the
        scene…then bids the actors take the stage and be their best artistic selves,’”
        (Hein, 2006,111) Here she is quoting Philip Rhys Adams, and goes on to suggest
        that by bringing the objects out of a traditional museal context, we can enable
      visitors to establish direct, personal, perhaps even artistic, connections. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">From
        the museum&#39;s perspective… the object remains central, but its
        multidimensionality is accommodated in a manner that partially detaches the
        object from the museum context and dematerializes it. The performance of
        certain ritualized acts by appropriately empowered persons sanctions a
        temporary demusealization of the object and its reinsertion into the life
      stream. (Hein 2006, 124) </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Here Hein is speaking of a group of Tibetan
        monks who create a mandala at the Davis museum in Wellesley College. It is this
        sort of integration of ritual use of objects in the museum context which
      “demusealizes” these objects and makes them more relevant to our real lives. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">We have found something similar to occur with
        the <i>Art of Storytelling</i> project, where
          by selecting works of art to write about, visitors bring these objects into
          their own lives. One participant discusses these objects in the context of her
          creative writing group: “I periodically think back to the works of art from the
          contest, especially since I’m in a writer’s critique group, and most of our
          members participated in the contest. We&#39;ve discussed the stories and works of
          art many times.” To have permanent collections be the source of ongoing
      discussions in local communities is an aspiration shared by many museums.</p>

      Closet</i></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">While Hein discusses at length <i>why</i> museums should adopt her model, she provides few
        examples of the practical application of her model in the field. She provides
        no specifics relevant to the Internet, though she does suggest the potential
        that these technologies offer to both support and extend her theoretical
        framework: “Electronic communication technologies have orbited far beyond
        Malraux&#39;s photographically facilitated “museum without walls.” They now offer
        worldwide access to museums interactively, replacing physical contact and
        one-way communication with intangible lines of exchange (Hein, 2006, 116). She
      states: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">[T]he “virtual museum” can be an avenue to information
        exchange unformatted by the authoritative voice of the museum. “Virtual
        visitors” to some museums now exceed actual ones numerically. They can freely
        rearrange their downloaded treasure and shape it into “collections” of their
        own devising, however and in the company of whomever they like. Like the
        emerging public art, whose identity lies in its process, the “virtual museum”
        is ephemeral. Its vitality lies in the capacity to meet contemporary needs with
        contemporary means. (Hein,
      2006, 117)</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The <i>Art of Storytelling</i> project outlined herein is one such “contemporary
        mean”. And while we identified a few other compelling on-line projects that
        address the concept of visitor storytelling and narratives in the art museum
        context, we found none that had been, as of yet, formally evaluated. What we
        did identify were a number of visitor-contributed narrative projects in an art
        museum context that, while not technologically facilitated, have been
      evaluated, and provide compelling research insights into this concept. </p>
      <h1>Visitor
      Narratives in Art Museums</h1>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Art museums as institutions have the unique
        opportunity to encourage visitors to foster connections with objects that have
        shaped culture throughout history. Programming that incorporates an interactive
        component, casting the visitor as “storyteller” in the creation of visual or
        written content inspired by works on display, is a particularly effective tool
        for reinforcing art’s role as a catalyst for meaningful connections. Whether
        integrated with public school curricula or unique to a particular exhibit,
        museum programming that asks visitors to develop original content in response
        to art, and occasionally makes that visitor-contributed content itself a
        component of the exhibit, has proven itself a viable resource in various ways.
        This programming not only encourages the development of critical thinking and
        visual literacy skills in students, but also and more broadly engages museum
      visitors of all ages in the meaning-making process.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">To borrow a phrase from Janna Graham and Shadya
        Yasin’s essay entitled “Reframing Participation in the Museum: A Syncopated
        Discussion,” participatory exercises in response to artwork allow a museum to
        transcend the burdensome stigma of static institution and instead become “a
        laboratory for the exploration of relationships between cultures and art
        forms”, (2007, 169) and with that, a prime locus of learning. With arts
        programming in public schools often overlooked, schools are increasingly
        partnering with museums in hopes of sharpening students’ critical thinking
        skills. One popular tool used in this partnership (many of our readers will
        already be familiar with it) is <i>Visual Thinking Strategies</i> (VTS), the capstone program from Visual
          Understanding in Education, a firm specializing in educational research and the
          development of elementary school curricula. Developed over a decade ago, VTS
          aims, through a series of art and writing projects on museum artworks, museum
          visits, and an ongoing classroom component, to teach young students how to
        “examine and find meaning in visual art” (http://vue.org/whatisvts.html). Two
          museums which successfully partnered with neighboring public schools to put
          arts curricula into action are the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston,
      and The Wolfsonian Institute in Miami.</p>
      <h1>Educational
      Programming</h1>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Thinking through Art</i> at the Gardner Museum, evaluated in a three-year
        (2003-2006) study of “student learning in [the Museum’s] already
        well-established School Partnership Program” (Burchenal &amp; Grohe, 2007, 5)
        turned to a <i>Visual Thinking Strategies</i> curriculum in efforts to teach elementary school
          students the fundamentals of how to “look” critically and constructively. In
          order to assess student gains from the program, in which students wrote a
          variety of essays in response to significant work in the Gardner collection, a
        “critical thinking rubric” of seven primary skills was used: Observing,
          Interpreting, Evaluating, Associating, Problem-Finding, Comparing and Flexible
          Thinking. The goal was for students to engage with the artwork through
          practising their “active looking” skills, teaching them to deconstruct what
          might otherwise have been an alienating work of art and use the visual
          components they observed to build a successful argument in writing. The
          critical thinking rubric was used to measure improvement not only in the
          students’ written work throughout the course of the program, but also in their
          class participation and discussion. Though the published materials on <i>Thinking
            Through Art </i>do not present
      quantified results on academic gains, </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">this
        study confirmed through research what many museum educators have come to
        believe through personal experience: that regular practice in looking at and
        discussing works of art using the VTS technique is remarkably effective in
        developing students’ capacity to think critically. Our results… bolster the
        argument that learning to look at art should be an integral part of every
        child’s experience. (Burchenal &amp; Grohe, 2007,
      17). </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Participatory exercises at the museum
        have also garnered positive results without as formal a relationship to
      academic work.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In a three-month long program run from
        Feb-April 2006, the Wolverhampton Art Gallery asked students in neighbouring
        schools to cast themselves as “storytellers” in a more organic sense, utilizing
        oral storytelling, creative writing and dance exercises facilitated by visiting
        artists and performers in the classroom to get young museum-goers excited about
        and inspired by art. “Storyteller/writers…[worked] with the 3 schools in
        Wolverhampton to develop creative oracy and literacy [skills] using artifacts
        contained within the Silk Road themes loan box developed by the Wolverhampton
        Art Gallery” (Wolverhampton, 2006, 2). The objectives of the programming seemed
        to be to first inspire students through unique artifacts and engaging dance and
        storytelling performances, and then use these stimuli to “develop…literacy
        skills, particularly in regards to creative writing” (Wolverhampton, 2006, 3)
      and encourage use of each one’s own “authentic voice” (Wolverhampton, 2006, 6). </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In fact, each evaluation presented programming
        assessed via a unique rubric, yet a common thread through most was the goal to
        improve literacy as defined by standardized test scores. A constant emphasis in
        public school curricula, improvements to literacy test scores are therefore an
        important component to curricula developed through museum partnerships. While
        there were significant increases in other areas such as creativity,
        communication and connection, none of these programs reported statistically
      significant improvements in literacy test scores. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Test scores aside, the positivity and enthusiasm
        for art and learning successfully channeled through these programs were also
        embraced by the <i>Artful Citizenship Project</i> at The Wolfsonian, in partnership with several Title
          1 elementary schools in Miami. Like the Gardner museum, <i>Artful
            Citizenship</i> also used a VTS
              based curriculum and incorporated academic goals similar to those of the
              Gardner museum, the Guggenheim museum (mentioned later) and the Wolverhampton
              Art Gallery. Yet what made this program unique was that in addition to
              bettering scholastic skills, its “arts-integrated social studies curriculum”
            sought to improve the 3<sup>rd</sup> -5<sup>th</sup> grade students’
            psycho-social skills in efforts to teach responsible citizenship. Through <i>Artful
                Citizenship</i>, students were
                  able to do a number of hands-on art activities that engendered great
                  enthusiasm, including “travelogues, dioramas, [and] drawing activities” (Curva
                  and Associates, 2005, 74), all inspired by the socially-conscious collection at
      The Wolfsonian. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Kate Rawlinson, of The Wolfsonian’s education
        department, praised the program’s use of “visual elements, an incredible
        [resource to] improve remedial skills” in students. Yet Rawlinson’s true
        measure for the success and importance of the <i>Artful Citizenship Project</i> was the students’ excitement about participating.
        “Kids want to do <i>Artful Citizenship</i>” says Rawlinson; “they enjoy it- how many
            opportunities do young people have to express their opinions and be listened
      to?” (personal communication, January 2008)</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">For students, undoubtedly one of the most
        impacting components of the program came during its final portion, the visit to
        The Wolfsonian. “The purpose of the visit was to allow students to directly
        experience and reflect upon the images and artifacts on exhibit” (Curva and
        Associates, 2005, 12). The artwork they created during <i>Artful Citizenship</i> was formally displayed at the museum as
          visitor-contributed content, label and all, generating pride and enthusiasm in
          the students. Their artworks, noted Rawlinson “were handled like any artwork in
          the museum” (personal communication, January 2008), and established  the museum as a personally meaningful
      place where their creative visions and contributions were valued.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Another successful partnership was fostered
        between the Guggenheim and local NYC public schools for its <i>Learning Through
          Art</i> initiative. In
            addition to improving students’ critical thinking and writing skills through
            art-making and writing exercises, <i>Learning Through Art</i>, like other partnership programs discussed, sought
              to improve literacy test scores. While no marked improvements in scores were
              revealed through comparing the English Language Arts test scores of control
              students vs. <i>Learning Through Art</i> participants, student questionnaires revealed the
                treatment group showed more positive attitudes towards art and the study of
                art. Through open discussions about art at the Guggenheim, essays on important
                paintings, and teaching artists in the classroom developing art projects
                alongside teachers, students learned the skill of “close and careful looking”
              (Randi Korn &amp; Associates, 2007, 148) at artworks and the visual elements
                within them. With that foundation, they were able to make connections between
                those elements not only to improve their writing, but also to create original
                artworks individually and as a class, inspired by art at the Guggenheim and
      elsewhere. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Senior Education Manager of the <i>Learning
        Through Art</i> program Rebecca
          Shulman Herz  recalls a memorable
          project involving teaching geography to students through the exploration of
          space. Students learned about “intervention artists” Christo and Richard Serra,
          among others, and the innovative ways in which their installations interact
          with their environment. The culminating exercise for students was the building
          of their own outdoor installation, inspired by a theme of “peace”, around their
          playground. “The kids were put into the role of the artist, and taught how to
          investigate” says Herz, and with this firsthand knowledge, coupled with class
          lessons on specific artworks, students visited the Guggenheim and participated
          in discussions with docents where they “were treated as the experts” and
          allowed to voice their knowledge and impressions of the works (personal
          communication, January 2008). Like at The Wolfsonian, <i>Learning
            Through Art</i> employed
              visitor-contributed content in its programming, with student-created works put
              on display for the final museum visit, an exhibit that also went up at the
              schools so as many kids as possible could see their artwork hung. Kids were
              encouraged to respond to their fellow students’ works through postcards at the
              exhibit which they could write and mail back to the school, so that classmates
      could get a tangible sense of the impact art can have.</p>
      <h1>Curatorial
      Programming</h1>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Visitor-contributed content has also been a
        significant component of museum programming outside of school partnerships;
        multiple programs developed by the Denver Art Museum, particularly those
        centered around their new Hamilton Building, have incorporated it as a
        meaningful way in which to engage visitors. The contributed content created by
        visitors during these interactive programs was not artwork; it instead took the
        form of a public, communal journal placed in certain galleries as part of the
        Caitlin Cubes, What is West?, Western American Art, Pacific Story, and Frederic
      Remington: The Color of Night programs. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The writing exercises for the above exhibits
        included poetry writing, and journal entries in response not only to artworks,
        but also to question prompts integrated into the exhibit. Activities were
        designed to be done in a communal journal, and the reading of previous entries
        was encouraged for inspiration. Many of these journal writing activities also
        included the option to listen to pre-selected inspirational soundtracks on an
        iPod. Regarding the “Caitlin Response Activity” in particular, which asked for
        visitor responses to different opinions presented on what is considered the
        Museum’s most controversial painting (Caitlin’s portrait of himself painting a
        Mandan Chief, 1848), “many interviewees said it was interesting to read other
        visitors’ perspectives and opinions” (Randi Korn &amp; Associates, 2007, 15) on
        a complex work, and all but one individual interviewed took the time to read
      others’ responses. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">About the “What is West?” Response Activity,
        where visitors were given a place to sit, read others’ entries, and write their
        own thoughts in the public journal on the meaning of the West, one visitor
        commented: “what I wrote was passionate. If I stop and think about it, I am
        outraged at what we’ve done to the American Indians in the wake of Manifest
        Destiny. While a lot of these paintings glorify the West, there’s a dark side
      to this history that we…ignore” (Randi Korn &amp; Associates, 2007, 20).</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Visitors to the Denver Art Museum’s special
        exhibition “Frederic Remington: The Color of Night” had the opportunity to
        engage in new types of writing activities in the galleries. “Frederic
      Remington: The Color of Night” also </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">provided
        an opportunity for museum staff to develop new types of writing activities for
        visitors,[as] two different types of poetry writing booklets were placed at
        each of two seating areas in the gallery, encouraging visitors to reflect on
        Remington’s paintings of nighttime themes and subject matter. Since a poetry
        writing activity is also planned for the Western galleries in the Museum’s new
      wing, the Remington activities were used as a pilot study. (<i>Musynergy</i>, 2004, 5)</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Responses to this type of programming were
        positive overall, with visitors coming away feeling that their perspectives on
        the work were changed for the better, as the activity promoted involvement with
        the works and helped them make connections amongst exhibited works by
        Remington. Additionally, visitors’ comfort levels in the gallery increased,
        though many interviewees noted they would have wanted clearer “permission”
        (Musynergy, 2004, 15) to participate in the activity. One visitor to the
        Remington exhibit who participated in the writing activities said they were “another
        way of opening up, responding to what you’re seeing and pulling everything
        together. It’s not just a visual thing, it’s an emotional thing, a spiritual
        thing” (Musynergy, 2004, 14); clearly meaningful connections were sparked not
        only through asking museum goers to reflect on art, but also by giving them
        access to the thoughts and writings of other visitors just like them. Lisa
        Steffen, Master Teacher for Western American Art at the Denver Art Museum, who
      worked to develop these gallery activities, speaks to their significance: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">The
        struggle we keep coming away with is how to entice adult visitors
        to do activities that are intended for them. When we ask adults to do an
        activity in a testing situation, they say they wouldn&#39;t have done it on
        their own in the gallery – but we also hear that they both enjoy it
        and have a deeper experience with the art. It&#39;s not easy, but
        with [such] outcomes, the challenge to overcome preconceptions and
        draw folks in is well worth taking on. [Steffens continues:] when we test
        response activities, we often see/hear evidence of things happening that we
        care about – the visitor spending more time with an artwork, looking
        longer, looking more closely, making personal connections, etc – and
        that&#39;s enough to make us want to create conditions for that to happen more.
      (personal communication, January 2008)</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">While interactive activities are arguably useful
        tools with great potential for both museums and their visitors, it is important
        to note that not all activities across the board are met with positive results.
        Aside from literacy concerns with school partnerships, the program evaluations
        from the Denver Art Museum revealed that not all visitor responses were
        entirely positive. Key issues which emerged both with the writing activities in
        the public journals and the art-making activities in the galleries included
        reconciling gallery activities involving touching, writing, drawing etc. with
        traditionally “appropriate” museum behavior, age-appropriateness of the
        activities for adults vs. children and families, and intimidation faced both
        when asked to develop original creative content in a museum environment and
        when faced with a self-guided activity that didn’t have an instructor or museum
      professional playing a supervisory role. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The issue of decorum seemed minor, with visitors
        usually intrigued enough by the activity to approach it anyway, though the
        study concluded that it was important to emphasize that “the Denver Art Museum
        is different than other art museums” (Musynergy, 2004, 8) and encourage
        visitors to “move beyond their initial reservations” (Musynergy, 2004, 8) about
      what one does in a museum.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The question of age appropriateness was posed
        mainly in response to the art-making, not writing, activities; while many
        parents commented positively that the activities would be fun for kids, “nearly
        all interviewees said when they first approached it, they thought the
        postcard-making activity [among others] was intended for children” (Randi Korn
        &amp; Associates, 2007, 4). Adults also seemed confused at the activities that
        included traditionally kid friendly materials such as “rubber stamps and
        colored pencils” (Randi Korn &amp; Associates, 2007, 4). It seemed that the
      journal-writing activities were more relevant and engaging to adults overall.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Intimidation, while difficult to quantify, is a
        key component to consider when using interactive programming as a positive and
        progressive tool in rethinking meaning-making in museums. In response to the
        Frederic Remington poetry-writing activity, one participant noted “when I think
        of poetry, I think I can’t possibly do that” (Musynergy, 2004, 9). It is not
        only the requirements of the museum activity itself that can make visitors feel
        insecure in their skills, but also and perhaps most significantly the call to
        creativity that can seem daunting. A suggestion gleaned from a panel study of
        visitors conducted to assess the Frederic Remington poetry-writing activity was
        for the museum to “try incorporating an icebreaker question” (Musynergy, 2004,
        9) to ease visitors into the idea that the creative process can be embraced by
        anyone. The activity could be introduced with language that opens doors to all
        participants, such as “although we are not all artists or poets, we’re all
      creative in some ways….” (Musynergy, 2004, 9)</p>
      <h1>Interactive
      Programming</h1>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Whether affiliated with school curricula or
        developed around a particular exhibit, interactive programming holds great
        potential to involve, engage and reward the museum visitor and the institutions
        themselves through allowing a new forum to establish valuable relationships
        with art. The next step might be channeling the creative and learning processes
        engendered through this programming and coupling it with new technologies to
        speak to an even wider audience. One such program which utilizes technology as
        a vehicle for visitor-contributed content is set to launch this spring at the
      Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum. Called <i>Round</i> and developed by artist Halsey Burgund, it is</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote"> an audio installation that will solicit
        spoken voice contributions from visitors and use them as part of a musical
        composition intended to be listened to while viewing the work on [display] in
        the galleries. The interactive audio experience will allow visitors to hear a
        diverse range of voices – including artists, curators, and visitors
        – sharing their perspectives about the exhibitions and to add their
        responses. The comments will be collected in a database of recordings and
        subsequently incorporated into the piece. Thus, there will be a continual loop
        of opinion and emotional response, all contained within a musical work. The
        flexible infrastructure developed and built for the installation will be the
        basis for future audio tours at the Museum. (personal communication, January

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Educator at the Aldrich Laura Kaufman reinforces
        that the goals of this exhibit correlate with the goals of the education
        department to encourage building more personally meaningful relationships
      between visitors and artworks. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">This

        world. The interactive component of <i>Round</i> and the subsequent audio tour, <i>Pause</i>. <i>Play</i> is critical in achieving meaningful
      exchange. (personal communication, January 2008) </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The <i>Art of Storytelling</i> at the Delaware Art Museum also utilizes new media
        to implement innovative programming, attracting visitors to respond to art and
        create their own stories through gallery tools that go beyond pen and paper.
        Interactive kiosks allow children to construct visual and written narratives
        that incorporate elements of the art they see around them on display,
        cultivating an immediate connection between the museum and their personal
        artistic exploration, while podcasts of original stories written by museum
        visitors on works at the Delaware Art Museum allow museum-goers the chance to
        experience alternative narratives to the authoritative curatorial viewpoint
      hallmark to audio tours. </p>
      <h1>The <i>Art of Storytelling</i> Project</h1>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Before discussing the results of our evaluation,
        it is worthwhile to take a step back and present all of the components of the <i>Art
          of Storytelling</i> project
            cohesively. In 2006, the Delaware Art Museum sought to create a
            collections-based museum education project geared to children ages 8-12. The
            objective was to enhance young museum-goers’ appreciation for the visual arts
            through the wonders of storytelling; this program would explore both the
            stories expressed through art and the stories behind the artwork. To implement
            this vision, Night Kitchen Interactive collaborated with the Museum’s
            curatorial and education teams to develop a three-part educational program
            designed to inspire audiences to make connections between the visual narrative
      of art and the tradition of storytelling. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The <i>Art of Storytelling</i> program began with a call for entries from
        storytellers, artists, writers, and dramatists around the world; over 350
        entries by 116 storytellers were submitted, and twenty were featured in a
        podcast of narrated stories available as a self-guided gallery tour at the
        Museum. The primary goal of all of the stories was to
          bring new interest, excitement and meaning to the work and to encourage
          learners to engage with the work on an entirely different level than they would
          have by simply viewing it in the gallery. A kiosk-based gallery activity
        was developed to provide storytellers with the opportunity to tell their own
        stories by creating their own, unique compositions based on the images and
        words from the Delaware Art Museum collections. The <i>Picture a Story</i> interactive kiosk invites storytellers of all ages
          to create their own masterpiece and inspired story using elements from works in
          the museum. This interactive activity first involves the building of a scene,
          including the selection of genre, character, and props, which can be resized to
          fit anywhere on the chosen background. Once the picture is created, users are
          encouraged to write and record a narration of their own story, detailing their
          interpretation of what is occurring in their newly-crafted portrait collage. A
          final phase of the project, currently underway, is the launch of an Art of
          Storytelling Web site, where on-line visitors can experience stories, tell new
          stories about works in the museum, and engage in the Picture a Story interactive
          activity previously only available at a kiosk in the museum. Through this site
          the museum intends to continue to cultivate a collection of stories inspired by
      its collections.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig
      4: The future homepage for Delaware Art Museum’s <i>The Art of Storytelling</i> Web site, launching in April, 2008.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Our evaluation looked at the impact of these
        project components not only on students in participating schools, but also on
        the storytellers who contributed their narratives in the call for entries. The
        information we collected provided some interesting observations, and reinforced
        the view that interactive programming, particularly that which incorporates
        visitor-contributed content, holds for museums to build closer relationships
      with their visitors.</p>
      <h1>Evaluation</h1>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In order to determine if visitor-contributed
        content was in fact of value to those who contributed, and to assess the value
        of the project to the Delaware Art Museum, the writers of the <i>Art of
          Storytelling</i> stories were
            surveyed by e-mail about their experiences since writing the story. In the year
            since the call for entries, had participation in this project altered their
            lives, especially in regards to thinking about art either in- or outside of art
            museums? Does the way they think about art support art museum goals for visitor
      outcomes? </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Overall, we found that the process of writing
        the story had a positive effect on the writers, and in ways which art museums
      would find useful - visitor engagement and interest in the artwork. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">First, the fact that 55% (64 of the original
        116) of the storytellers responded to our survey shows a long-term commitment
      to the project.  </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="fisherfig5.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="400" height="211"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 5</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Second, participation seems to have a positive
        effect on continuing relationships with art museums: 92% of those returning the
        survey said that they felt more connected to the artwork or to the Delaware Art
        Museum because of the story-writing experience, and of these people, 59% also
      felt a greater connection to art museums in general. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="fisherfig6.jpg" alt="figure 6" width="400" height="146"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 6</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">While we do not know what the museum-visiting
        behavior of this group was before the project, 94% have visited an art museum
        since participating in the <i>Art of Storytelling</i> project in the summer of 2006. “It made me realize
          how visual input can influence creative output, and how enjoying art is not a
      passive, but active pursuit” answered one respondent.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="fisherfig7.jpg" alt="figure 7" width="400" height="160"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 7</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Third, the relationship with an art museum may
        be deepened because of participation. Twenty-one people who have visited an art
        museum since submitting a story now look at art in museums differently. Of
        these, 52% look for stories in art work, 24% find more personal meaning from
        their viewing, and 10% simply say it is more fun now to view art. All of these
        outcomes not only are positive for the participants but also indicate that the
        project supported the art museum in developing more appreciative and educated
      patrons.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="fisherfig8.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="400" height="328"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 8</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Fourth, participation positively influenced how
        writers experience works of art and the art-making process in general,
        illustrating the art museum’s ability to affect people’s lives beyond the
        institution. Of the 34 people who articulated the ways in which they were
        influenced, 26% noted that participation has changed how they view art when
        they visit art museums; 29% have even continued to think about the artwork for
        which they wrote their story and, in some cases, have done additional research
        on that work outside of the art museum environment. Even more encouraging, 33%
        of participants said that the act of writing a story for this project made them
      more creative in their own art, be it written work or in other media.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="fisherfig9.jpg" alt="figure 9" width="400" height="328"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 9</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The long-term impact of The <i>Art of
        Storytelling</i> project also
          may be documented in a small evaluation project done to assess the impact of
          the project on an audience who used, rather than contributed, content for the
          project. Through an educational program, The Delaware Art Museum presented
          selected audio stories to elementary school students. Students then wrote
          stories both before and after their visit, using one of the artworks as a
          prompt. They also had the opportunity to use the <i>Picture a Story</i> interactive activity developed with this project to
            compose their own original artwork and accompanying story. As a control, a
            parallel group of students did not listen to the stories on the iPod while in
            the galleries, nor did they use the interactive kiosk. All had the opportunity
      to write their own stories in response. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Two classes were surveyed in two studies. One
        group of 40 students came from a charter school with an on-going relationship
        with the Art Museum. These students visit the museum often, and their teachers
        have access to museum resources; therefore, they might be considered more
        “expert” visitors (McDermott-Lewis, 1990). The other group of 29 students was
        from a neighborhood school where the students traditionally have less exposure
        to art and museums. The pre- and post-writing exercises of the groups were
        analyzed for creativity, and the students were surveyed about their field trip
        experiences about three months after their visit. The criteria for creativity
        as defined by the museum staff were an increase in the length of the story and
        the number of adjectives used, and the inclusion of visual details from the
      artwork in their story.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">This evaluation did not find that exposure to
        the audio stories made a significant impact on the students’ story writing.
        Especially for students from the charter school, there was little positive
        change, either in the creativity measures or in the specifics of their <i>Picture
          a Story</i> kiosk exercise.
            There <i>was</i> an increase in
              creativity measures, however, for students from the neighborhood school; while
              their post-writing skills did not reach the level of the charter school
              students’ pre-writing skills, the increase in creativity might indicate that
              the use of inspirational, visitor-contributed content may be a way to reach
              more novice visitors. These findings correlate with those of the various school
              and museum partnerships explored earlier in this paper, where creativity, as
              measured by varying rubrics, and other affective values increased through
              interactive programming, while concrete literacy gains, as measured by
      standardized literacy tests, were not obtained.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">For both groups, though, there was good recall
        of the museum visit and of the audio stories, when used. Three months after the
        visit, students could remember details of the two iPod stories, as well as of
        the art work these stories were inspired by, even though the artworks were not
        what they remembered as their “favorites.” This observation suggests that use
        of visitor-contributed content may be a way to affect cognitive learning for
        audiences of the content, as well as a way of producing affective changes for
        the contributors themselves; at the very least, it seems a method to entertain
      and thus engage participants.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig
      10: Courtney Waring, Delaware Art Museum visiting a participating school.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Overall, the use of programs like the <i>Art of
        Storytelling</i> seems to meet
          art museum goals of developing observation skills, critical thinking, and
          personal meaning making. They seem less likely to satisfy classroom teachers
          who are looking for gains in literacy skills related to writing. However, more
          in-depth assessment needs to be undertaken. In the writing exercise evaluation,
          the researchers note that the choice to use the same painting for both the pre-
          and post-writing exercise, for instance, may have discouraged the creativity of
          some students during the post-writing experience. Many complained that they had
          already said what they had to say about this painting. Some decided to write a
          sequel to their previous story, in which they rehashed the first. This is
          clearly not the best assessment of creativity. In addition, there were a
          variety of factors that impacted the students’ museum experience differently,
          largely due to disparate guiding styles. This made it exceedingly difficult to
          compare across groups. A more tightly designed research project would better
          assess the potential impact that visitor-contributed content could have on
      students’ writing abilities.</p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">While technology-assisted, visitor-contributed
        narratives clearly reside in a burgeoning field of study, and within that field
        the <i>Art of Storytelling</i> project is in
          its early stages, the initial findings are compelling. In April of 2008,
          parallel to the publishing of this paper, the <i>Art of Storytelling </i>Web site will be launched. We look forward to tracking
            visitation and contributions to the project when it is available on-line,
      allowing us insight into another piece of the puzzle. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Clearly we have found that, like many of the
        other projects outlined in this paper and in concordance with the theoretical framework
        outlined earlier, participation in visitor-contributed content programs at art
        museums is valuable to the participants. Similarly, we believe, though we do
        not have the quantitative data to prove, that these programs offer museums
        valuable insight and interaction with new and existing audiences. The third and
        final part of the equation, the value that these programs provide to the
        general public of museum visitors, is yet to be completely clarified. For
        example, the Delaware Art Museum is still unsure of how to effectively utilize
        their podcast tour outside of an educational context. As the material is not of
        a traditional curatorial nature, it does not integrate with regular visitors’
        notions of a podcast tour, so its employment in that capacity is limited. The
        original intent was to use it with elementary school students as a podcast tour
        in the context of a gallery-based educational activity, followed by a
        story-writing exercise performed on the museum’s storytelling kiosks. While
        their use is not always followed by the kiosk activity, the podcasts themselves
        have become a fixture in a language-arts-based tour for school groups entitled <i>Painting
          with Words</i>. The museum’s
            latest effort to meet educators’ needs by establishing that the program addresses
            literacy curriculum was inconclusive as best. This is not surprising, as other
            programs addressing literacy in art museums have also come up with limited to
            no substantial impact on literacy test scores. Most important, the project as
            it was originally conceived was never meant to address literacy, but instead to
            impact the cognitive areas of creative thinking and visual literacy, and the
            affective areas of self-confidence and establishing voice. Unfortunately, our
            evaluation did not adequately and effectively address these areas of learning.
            All in all, a key dilemma remains. If we cannot find an appropriate outlet for
            visitor-contributed narratives in the museum experience, either on-line or at
            the museum, then we cannot entice visitors to contribute stories with false
      claims of audiences who do not, ultimately, exist. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">While all of this probably comes across as
        rather negative in the end, we hope not. We believe that the audiences and the
        contributors are out there. We have seen and heard enough from visitors exposed
        to the <i>Art of Storytelling</i> project –
        both on the storytelling side and on the audience side – to feel strongly
          that there is an appropriate use for this sort of visitor-contributed content.
          We simply believe that the optimal educational program for doing so, and an
      accurate mechanism to evaluate such a program, is yet to be determined.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In closing, we refer to Kate Rawlinson, <i>Artful
        Citizenship</i> Project
          Director and Assistant Director for Education and Public Programs at The
      Wolfsonian.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote"> For me it is a political/humanistic
        argument. We all gain from the dialogue that interactive museum programming
        nurtures. When a museum visitor (or student in a school-based program … like
        the Artful Citizenship project) is encouraged to respond to art or their learning/viewing
        experience of it – that is to be actively and personally involved in a
        meaningful dialogue – you put a complex set of human thoughts and
        feelings into play. Not only are you validating the visitor’s/student’s right
        to have an authentic response in a setting that often disempowers the
        non-initiated, but you (the museum educator) are also placing them and their
        experience at the center of your practice. It is a significant shift of power
        that benefits all who experience it as it opens doors of communication and
      human exchange. (personal communication, January 2008) </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">As a final note, here are a few comments from
        our storytellers regarding the <i>Art of Storytelling </i>project: “I see art as much more fun now. I am not
          nearly as shy when it comes to looking in depth at more intricate works of art.
          I enjoy the challenge these paintings provide.” “I think I have given more
          validity in my own mind to personal interpretations of artwork, rather than one
          right or wrong interpretation.” “It made me realize how visual input can
          influence creative output, and how enjoying art is not a passive, but active
          pursuit.” “I think I have given more validity in my own mind to personal
          interpretations of artwork, rather than one right or wrong interpretation.”
        “This contest’s IDEA has expanded my definition of the word “view.” These
          comments, more than anything else, suggest to us that visitor narratives have a
      place in museums.</p>
